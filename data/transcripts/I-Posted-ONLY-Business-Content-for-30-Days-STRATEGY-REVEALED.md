## Full Transcript
[00:00] I mean, 35,000 posts over 40 months

[00:02] and grew a 7.8 million person audience.

[00:04] And three weeks ago, I made six big shifts in my content.

[00:09] And I want to show you behind the scenes

[00:11] what we found from those six big shifts

[00:14] with screenshots of the data

[00:16] so that you can use this to make more money

[00:18] in your business and whatever you promote.

[00:19] And so the first was we went from edgetainment to education.

[00:24] So instead of being kind of halfway through

[00:25] to all the way all in on education.

[00:27] Now that had downstream impacts

[00:28] in terms of how we packaged, how we tidal things,

[00:30] even the number of special effects we have.

[00:32] And the purpose of education is I see it's

[00:34] to change behavior.

[00:34] And so my point is with this video,

[00:36] once I show you the data of what's happened

[00:37] since that change, since we made these six shifts,

[00:40] that hopefully, or hopefully not,

[00:42] we'll see what you decide to do.

[00:43] But it will change how you may content to make more money.

[00:46] So number one is to educate edgetainment to education.

[00:49] Number two is going from for us to for you.

[00:51] Now I want to say for us what I ended up having with mistakes.

[00:53] I mean, unknowingly, was that I would be like team,

[00:57] what do you guys think about content?

[00:58] And so they'd be like, hey, we should make a video on this.

[01:00] Hey, we should make a video on this.

[01:01] And so what ended up having is I started making videos

[01:03] for my team, not my deal customer, a business owner.

[01:06] And so I actually had a friend come into town and say,

[01:09] hey, it's weird.

[01:09] I actually haven't been paying attention to your content.

[01:11] He just about 10 million bucks here.

[01:12] And I was like, he's like, why guess I'm not really

[01:15] your avatar?

[01:15] It's like, whoa, it was like, you are 100% my avatar.

[01:18] What's going on?

[01:19] And so as soon as I realized that I was like, oh man,

[01:22] he's like, you just didn't feel as relevant to me.

[01:24] And so I was making stuff for my team rather than my avatar.

[01:26] And so if you are somebody who makes content,

[01:28] something to be mindful of is your team

[01:31] might not be the type of people you're trying to make

[01:32] content for.

[01:33] So just something interesting for me.

[01:34] So I went from four us, our team, to four you,

[01:37] viewer for business owners.

[01:38] Number three, we've been from wide to narrow.

[01:40] So fitness, relationships,

[01:42] setter, there's our wider topics.

[01:43] More people are in relation to more people eat food,

[01:45] more people are trying to lose weight compared to,

[01:46] only 9% of people are business owners.

[01:48] And so we went much narrower on the topic of like,

[01:50] I'm just talking about business,

[01:51] because that's what I love talking about too, as a side note.

[01:53] And so it turns out, business owners like it more

[01:55] when I talk about business,

[01:56] and I like it more as a business owner.

[01:57] So everybody wins, at least for me.

[01:59] Number four, as we went from views to revenue.

[02:01] Now this is key.

[02:02] So when you just have views as a metric,

[02:04] then you kind of do chase water,

[02:06] because it was the only real metric we were tracking.

[02:07] And we didn't really have anything better at the time.

[02:09] And since we focused on, since then we've transitioned

[02:12] to Ad revenue.

[02:12] Here's why.

[02:13] Ad revenue takes into account views,

[02:15] but it has a second metric that's paired with it,

[02:17] which is RPM, which is revenue per thousand eyeballs.

[02:21] So if you, if YouTube pays lots of money for the eyeball,

[02:25] then it means they're more valuable.

[02:26] And if they're more valuable to advertisers,

[02:27] they're more valuable to me.

[02:28] And so my idea here is that I want to make sure

[02:32] that we're showing our videos to the other people,

[02:33] or rather that the right people are watching.

[02:35] Now once we can control for that,

[02:37] and we stay, or keep our RPMs,

[02:38] or the amount of advertisers willing

[02:39] to pay for these eyeballs high,

[02:41] then we get as many views as we can.

[02:43] And as a total of protests for business stuff in general,

[02:46] paired KPIs were exceptionally well.

[02:48] So if you're a customer success,

[02:49] you want the speed of resolution,

[02:51] be also an equality metric.

[02:52] If you had a company that did cleaning,

[02:54] you'd be the same thing as you'd pair reviews

[02:56] from customers with the number of cleans per day.

[02:58] And so you'd like to have both edges

[03:00] so that you can control for both sides,

[03:01] and you should do that with any department you can.

[03:03] Now, so I said, number four was views to ad revenue

[03:06] as our primary metric that we were optimizing for.

[03:09] So we no longer cared, oh, this one had a lot of views,

[03:11] we don't care about that.

[03:11] It's just, do we have as many views

[03:13] with the right people?

[03:14] Number five is when emphasizing short-scent-facizing longs.

[03:17] We saw that longs got the best people,

[03:21] and the whole thesis around shorts creates longs viewers,

[03:24] we actually haven't seen any evidence that supports that.

[03:27] People watch shorts want more shorts,

[03:28] people want longs want to pour longs,

[03:30] which doesn't necessarily mean that people

[03:31] from a different platform don't watch you on shorts on TikTok,

[03:36] and then there are long-form YouTube watchers,

[03:38] and then watch your stuff on YouTube that long.

[03:40] But usually, people who watch long-form stuff on YouTube,

[03:43] watch long-form stuff on YouTube, people watch shorts form,

[03:45] on YouTube, watch short form.

[03:47] Some people watch both,

[03:48] but most of the time people have kind of had consumption preferences,

[03:51] and they're not going to change the preferences for you,

[03:52] they just might watch you in a different place

[03:54] where that consumption preference is what you make.

[03:56] And so we found that,

[03:57] and we found that the longs are the things

[03:58] that actually drove the most applications for our acquisition

[04:01] to not come, and the most book sales, and the most opt-ins.

[04:04] So that's what we're making more of.

[04:05] And number six was assuming more versus assuming nothing.

[04:08] Meaning, I made videos like the Alex Ramosi Diet.

[04:12] I made the Alex Ramosi vlog, the Hermosi's, things like that.

[04:16] Those assume that somebody who doesn't know me,

[04:20] will want to care about whoever the hell Alex Ramosi is,

[04:22] which I don't think is that reasonable.

[04:24] Like, I don't think they would want that,

[04:26] because who cares about this random dude?

[04:28] And so it's assuming nothing.

[04:30] Now, that has changes in terms of what we're making.

[04:33] So there's no assumptions.

[04:34] So for example, like, we are not because this is not calm.

[04:37] We have portfolio businesses.

[04:38] I introduce myself, because if you don't know why I am,

[04:41] this might be the first video you see me.

[04:42] And so if I stop doing that for a while,

[04:45] because I kind of wanted this mindset that everyone knew.

[04:48] Now, obviously, that's dumb.

[04:49] Wait more people don't know me than know me.

[04:51] But you kind of fall into this trap

[04:52] of assuming you're talking to your warm audience,

[04:54] rather than what you're making the content forward,

[04:56] which is people who've never met you before.

[04:57] And so keeping that top of mind, which is that,

[04:59] we want to make sure that we welcome everyone,

[05:01] and that we don't have inside jokes,

[05:02] that only people who are on the inside feel it,

[05:04] because that all it does is it excludes people that are new.

[05:07] And like what you want to do is bring more people

[05:09] in your world anyways, especially if they're business owners

[05:11] for me.

[05:11] And so there's six changes that we made in our content.

[05:16] And so we've gone all in on that concept.

[05:18] And so we've done a lot of rapid iteration.

[05:20] But let me tell you the data that's happened since.

[05:23] So right off the bat, RPMs,

[05:25] meaning the revenue per thousand viewers,

[05:27] went up by 68%.

[05:30] So like when you think, man,

[05:31] I don't feel like I can, like, what my content is about,

[05:33] like it doesn't change anything.

[05:35] Well, it sure has held it for us.

[05:37] When I talk about deep business stuff,

[05:38] when I talk about reducing churn,

[05:40] when I talk about increasing number of ways to get someone

[05:42] to buy more times.

[05:43] And I talk about how we scale to 40% sales team

[05:46] and the all the steps that we did in order to that

[05:48] in a real case to any in a real business.

[05:49] When I talk about how you can deconstruct

[05:50] and reconstruct a brand,

[05:52] these are a deeper business concepts.

[05:54] And guess what?

[05:55] Business owners watch them.

[05:56] And guess what?

[05:58] Those eyeballs are more valuable.

[05:59] 68% and we're only gonna get better at it.

[06:01] And so for us boom, that meant that us changing our topics

[06:05] got the right people to watch the videos.

[06:07] Check box one.

[06:08] And so you can see by the video title,

[06:11] when we had educational versus kind of wide

[06:13] or business education versus wider topics,

[06:15] the wider topics in general

[06:17] had way lower RPMs.

[06:18] You can see that with the light blue,

[06:19] where it's the purple is more money making, more business,

[06:23] more sales, more retention, real business tactics

[06:27] that grow companies.

[06:28] And those, unsurprisingly, were way higher

[06:31] in average RPM.

[06:32] Some of them even hired them.

[06:33] So the next big change,

[06:34] I see this is anecdotal,

[06:35] is that 25% more comments per view.

[06:39] And so I see that as an engagement metric

[06:40] that we had way more people saying,

[06:42] wow, this is good or this is great,

[06:43] or I missed this style of content.

[06:44] That's actually a really common thing.

[06:46] And I will say this, this is to my, this is my decrement.

[06:49] I should have seen that more business owners

[06:52] were telling us in the comments what they wanted.

[06:54] And honestly, I just wasn't listening.

[06:58] And that's on me.

[06:59] I was like, well, you're gonna lose some people

[07:01] as you make more high production stuff, that's okay.

[07:04] But with the return to hardcore business education

[07:08] in terms of the content that we're making,

[07:10] the response has been overwhelming

[07:12] that so many people were like,

[07:13] I'm coming back to all your content.

[07:15] This has been great, this is what I came here for,

[07:17] and so I'm stoked about that.

[07:18] And so we got 25% more people who are doing that.

[07:20] We have more shares negligible,

[07:22] and slightly if you were like switch again, whatever.

[07:26] But for me, I would say comment,

[07:27] I would rate comments and shares as higher.

[07:29] And so overall, we had hiring engagement

[07:31] from these videos, even though they were narrow topics,

[07:34] which to me is more good for fewer people

[07:37] than a little bit of good for a lot of people,

[07:38] which is where I wanna be in terms of what I wanna serve,

[07:41] or who I wanna serve.

[07:42] So the next big change is that, despite,

[07:44] this is a key point, despite having fewer absolute views

[07:48] per long form video, we're actually getting

[07:50] more long form views over all across the channel.

[07:53] So we're up 30, almost 30% 29.56%,

[07:57] then our six weeks average before that,

[08:00] from these deeper educational videos.

[08:02] Now, realistically, that's a function of one main thing

[08:05] in my opinion.

[08:06] That's because the education stuff actually requires

[08:10] far less post-editing, and I can make more education stuff

[08:13] because this is what I do every day.

[08:14] And so we can actually create more content,

[08:17] which I'm stoked about, and I think,

[08:19] I mean, hopefully business owners are too.

[08:21] And so we actually get more overall views with the right people,

[08:24] because we don't have nearly as much high,

[08:27] high post-production,

[08:29] whiz bangs, which is what most of my audience

[08:31] who was trying to learn stuff rather than be entertained

[08:33] was happy about.

[08:34] All right, this next one is very surprising to me at least.

[08:38] So our subscriber conversion increased by 24.6%.

[08:44] And so that means that we've actually, like, even though,

[08:47] again, we had slightly lower absolute views,

[08:50] more long-form views, that we actually increased

[08:52] the absolute number of subscribers per week since doing this.

[08:57] So like, I mean, I was very comfortable

[08:59] with all of these metrics taking.

[09:01] Like, that was honestly expected that,

[09:03] because I was like, all right, well,

[09:03] we're gonna have way fewer views,

[09:05] but it's gonna be the right people.

[09:06] But because 25% more people who watch, subscribe,

[09:12] even though we get fewer views,

[09:13] our actual subscriber growth has grown, which is crazy.

[09:17] In an absolute metric, quite.

[09:18] So this was an unexpected outcome for me,

[09:21] and has just reinforced that this was the right decision

[09:24] for the audience that I want, which is business owners.

[09:26] The next thing is like, okay, well, if you're getting fewer views,

[09:28] how's that gonna translate to options?

[09:31] Because I'm a business owner, like, that's what I care about.

[09:32] Okay, right people who are trying to become portfolio companies,

[09:36] come to a workshop, whatever.

[09:38] And so it turns out that we have 26% more options per week

[09:45] since making this change.

[09:47] And so this is like both incredibly surprising

[09:49] and also incredibly duh.

[09:51] And I say this because like saying,

[09:53] hey, I'm gonna make business owner stuff

[09:54] to get more business owners duh.

[09:56] But at the same time, I would say this,

[09:58] just me kind of commenting on a lot of the educators

[10:01] that are in the space, they tend to start moving

[10:03] more and more broad, more and more wide,

[10:05] more and more entertainment,

[10:07] more and more topics that they don't necessarily have expertise on,

[10:09] because they seek the views.

[10:10] Whether they say they're not,

[10:11] they don't want to say they're like like saying cash,

[10:13] except they still kind of count their likes.

[10:14] And so I think if you can just absolutely get your logic

[10:17] ahead of them, which is tough, because sometimes it's tough

[10:20] to go away from this vanity metrics.

[10:22] But I care about the bottom line.

[10:24] And so the right people were seeing it

[10:26] and the right people were taking action.

[10:28] And so we, in the business sense,

[10:30] saw growth from this in a big way.

[10:32] And this is just like three weeks in,

[10:34] four weeks into this kind of execution

[10:37] all in on the strategy.

[10:38] And this will compound.

[10:39] And so if these don't know,

[10:40] I have two best selling books on Amazon.

[10:41] They're still like number one and number two

[10:42] on marketing and sales.

[10:43] And they've been there for like number one and number two

[10:45] for two years or three years or whatever,

[10:47] how they've been out.

[10:48] So they're pretty strong.

[10:49] And so we sell books every month no matter what.

[10:51] But it was crazy to me, was to see this jump in book sales,

[10:56] the happiness, like think about this.

[10:58] We're getting fewer views.

[11:00] But more sales buy a lot, like two X the sales twice.

[11:07] Not only 20% twice the sales of books that I have.

[11:11] And mind you, by the way, if you're like,

[11:12] hey, I'm poor.

[11:14] I get it.

[11:15] My books are free too.

[11:16] But like you can go to Aquas and I come

[11:17] and you get the video course on my stuff for free

[11:19] and off the opt-in.

[11:20] And you can go on my podcast

[11:22] and you can listen to the audiobook for free.

[11:24] All right, like the stuff's free.

[11:25] This isn't how I make my money.

[11:26] But it's a really good, leading indicator for me

[11:29] to have the quality of traffic.

[11:30] Now if you want to get a physical copy, yes,

[11:32] there's printing costs, there's shipping costs.

[11:33] So yeah, you pay some bucks.

[11:34] But if your dead drug poor, you can use the free stuff.

[11:37] The point is, is that this attracted the right people.

[11:40] People who want, because if I make a fitness meals video,

[11:44] guess where those people don't care about.

[11:45] Getting leads and making offers.

[11:47] Kind of sounds obvious when you think about it.

[11:48] When I make a, hey, this is how I work with Leyla, my wife.

[11:52] Maybe you get somebody's like,

[11:53] what about the married entrepreneurs?

[11:54] It's like, well, only 9% of people are business owners.

[11:57] And then of that 9% how many of them are married

[11:59] to their partner percentage or percentage?

[12:01] Versus, just talking about business stuff,

[12:05] business people want to get more leads,

[12:07] make more offers, make more money.

[12:08] And so that's what my book's about.

[12:10] And so loan-ball-hold, more of those people bought.

[12:13] Now, I want to be super clear.

[12:14] I want to show these two keynotes here.

[12:16] So there are some keynotes that will be both deep and wide.

[12:20] And as a content creator slash business owner,

[12:24] slash investor, slash husband, slash human being.

[12:28] Anyway, boy big, sometimes you hit it out of the park

[12:32] and you actually get both.

[12:33] So my highest revenue preview video also happens to be

[12:38] my most viewed video.

[12:41] And so it doesn't necessarily mean that if you have a lot

[12:44] of views, the RPMs are low.

[12:46] No, not at all.

[12:47] You can get a video that applies to all business owners

[12:51] and it will get a lot of views.

[12:53] And the CPMs with RPMs will be high.

[12:56] The branding video is the same thing.

[12:57] That's very recent.

[12:58] It's new and it continues to climb up.

[13:00] And they're both of these are very conceptual business

[13:03] concepts that all business owners can benefit from.

[13:07] And so if I talk about leverage, almost all businesses

[13:10] need to understand strategy and leverage.

[13:12] It applies, it's a huge amount of value, two business

[13:14] owners.

[13:15] Understanding brand, tremendous value to any business.

[13:18] Now, on the other hand, you can also make,

[13:20] and we call these keynotes, but longer from either

[13:23] whiteboard presentations or like a presentation

[13:25] that I put a lot of time into.

[13:27] Some of them are going to be deeper and less wide.

[13:28] And that's OK.

[13:29] Like if I talk about scaling a 40-person sales team,

[13:32] if you have any commerce store, doesn't affect you.

[13:34] But leverage in brand would affect you

[13:35] whether you had the 40-person sales team

[13:37] or the commerce company or a software company,

[13:40] or an app, or whatever.

[13:42] And so again, the scaling 40-person sales team

[13:45] still super valuable, but it's just going to be only

[13:48] about, you know, valuable to one third of the business

[13:50] owner audience that I might be able to,

[13:51] you know, who might want to watch this.

[13:53] Same thing with the video I've made

[13:56] about 10Xing your business overnight

[13:58] by using mega influencers.

[14:00] Basically showing how to get a Mr. Beast, a Logan Paul,

[14:03] a rock, to partner with a connoomer,

[14:05] Gregor, a hoodabuty, a Taylor Swift,

[14:08] to partner with to 10X your business.

[14:10] Now, if you're a business like a local business,

[14:13] they're likely that they're going to partner with you

[14:14] is really low, right?

[14:15] And so it doesn't really make sense for that particular business.

[14:17] Now, you could use that on a micro scale,

[14:19] but it might just not have as much transference.

[14:21] If you have any commerce brand that's national,

[14:24] might make a ton of sense.

[14:25] But again, it's going to have a sub-segment

[14:27] of already a 9% slice of the population

[14:30] that it would be deeply valuable to them.

[14:32] Incess to the thing is, is that I have to think about,

[14:35] like, I'm okay with the video that gets 10,000 views

[14:38] instead of 400,000 views.

[14:40] If 10,000 of those people are $10 million

[14:43] plus business owners, it's like here.

[14:45] Here's how I packed my company in order to sell it.

[14:47] I have a video on my channel that walks through

[14:48] 46 minutes of the decision making process I use

[14:51] to determine to sell my business.

[14:52] Guess who that applies to?

[14:53] Basically no one, unless you're actually

[14:56] have a lot of money and you already have a business asset

[14:58] that has $5 million in profit or more.

[15:00] And so let's see, 9% of businesses,

[15:03] it's like 0.1% do $10 million a year of businesses.

[15:09] So there's like no one who that actually applies to,

[15:11] except for those people, or like this thing was amazing

[15:14] that changed my life.

[15:15] And I had a bunch of people after I posted that

[15:17] that I know that were big $20, $30,000,000 a year.

[15:20] So I'm so interested in watching people like this

[15:21] who's insane, I can't believe you gave this out.

[15:22] I'm like, believe it, because guess what?

[15:24] No, let's go watch it.

[15:26] And so I will say this, this is me giving you

[15:28] like a little hat tip for consuming.

[15:31] If you're a business owner, I would not gauge views

[15:34] as whether the video is good or not.

[15:37] It just shows how relevant it is to how many people.

[15:40] And so if you're an e-commerce person,

[15:43] I have some videos in here about how to use offers

[15:45] for e-commerce.

[15:47] That's just already going to be a slice of a slice,

[15:49] but it would be super applicable for you.

[15:51] And so I'm okay with very small views

[15:54] as long as the quality gives value and provides a result

[15:59] in a clear way for the viewer.

[16:02] And so I define education as change of behavior.

[16:04] So if I can help them change the behavior

[16:05] in a way that makes them more money,

[16:06] ideally they'll associate that money they made,

[16:09] that value them made with us at acquisition.com.

[16:12] And so that's the whole goal of this stuff.

[16:14] And for the creators out there,

[16:17] or those of you guys who are making content

[16:18] in order to promote your business,

[16:20] I'll give you this frame that I started out with that help me a lot,

[16:22] which is when I pushed my first,

[16:25] I started zero on every platform,

[16:26] doing very clear.

[16:27] It wasn't like I was Taylor Swift

[16:29] and I came on TikTok, yay.

[16:31] It wasn't like that.

[16:32] When I started on YouTube, I had no subscribers.

[16:34] And the first videos I posted got like 100 views, right?

[16:38] But I thought to myself, I was like, man,

[16:39] if I would probably go across town

[16:42] to speak to 100% audience for lunch,

[16:44] and I'd have no problem with that.

[16:45] And so the idea that I had 100 people,

[16:47] I was like, that's not bad.

[16:49] Or even if there's 10 people,

[16:50] well, I would talk to you a 10 person,

[16:51] I mean, I used to do this for years,

[16:52] I would do a lunch and learn,

[16:53] and see if I could sell some weight loss.

[16:55] You know, I mean, like, I was willing to do that anyways.

[16:57] And so there's this,

[16:59] it's literally just because of comparison

[17:01] that people feel bad about their social media content,

[17:03] not because inherently the numbers don't make sense.

[17:06] And the crazy thing about this

[17:07] and there's just one of the rampezized,

[17:08] is it's free, it's free.

[17:12] The platforms distribute your content for free.

[17:14] These are people that would never found out about you,

[17:16] and they find out about you for free.

[17:18] Like, take that in for a second.

[17:20] So the leverage on free distribution is infinite.

[17:23] And so if you get a thousand people over a month

[17:25] who see your thing, it's a thousand people.

[17:27] It's not nothing.

[17:29] And so I try to make sure that I focus on that concept

[17:31] of like, oh man, my average for the channel is 400,000.

[17:35] And we got a 50,000 V video.

[17:37] 50,000?

[17:38] My God, I speak to conferences with a thousand people.

[17:40] It's 50 times that.

[17:42] Not bad.

[17:44] And those people I got to have a really, really curated

[17:46] experience, increase the value for a second,

[17:48] absolutely crushes much values I possibly could

[17:51] in that in time period.

[17:52] And so I'll make one last note on the deep versus wide

[17:56] content is that I get so many DMs and like slack messages

[18:02] even from our portfolio company founders.

[18:04] Or like, dude, that last video was so sick.

[18:07] And I hadn't had that in a minute

[18:08] for probably the six months we went a little bit wider

[18:11] with our content.

[18:12] And it became so reinforcing for me.

[18:15] Even though like what's the number of people?

[18:17] I don't know.

[18:18] 50 people, maybe message me, be like, dude,

[18:20] that new content style or going back

[18:22] the new old content of more whiteboard, more deep

[18:25] business tactics, like it's so great.

[18:27] My team's watching it again.

[18:28] That feels me up because that's why I made this stuff

[18:30] to begin with with the stuff that I didn't have

[18:32] when I was coming up that I wish someone to taught me.

[18:34] And then I had to just find out through trial and error.

[18:36] And so that's why we make this stuff.

[18:38] But the views weren't high.

[18:41] But for me, like, I'm here for business owners.

[18:45] And I already know there's only 9% of people

[18:46] are business owners.

[18:48] And that's okay.

[18:49] I'm here for you guys.

[18:51] All right, so here's what we're doing next with this data.

[18:54] So we had our hypothesis.

[18:55] We looked at the 35,000 posts.

[18:56] We made these six big shifts.

[18:57] And by and large, we have crushed the hypothesis.

[19:01] So I'm actually like, I was telling my team yesterday.

[19:03] I was like, we're kind of lucky that this worked out

[19:06] the first time because like I'm not really

[19:07] used to things working out the first time.

[19:09] More like, realistically, we were like,

[19:10] hey, we made this change.

[19:11] And then like four of the six stats are bad.

[19:14] And two of them are good.

[19:14] And so we're like, all right, well, these ones are good.

[19:16] So let's try and keep this stuff the same.

[19:17] And then we got to tweak all these other things.

[19:20] Our viewed as a subscriber ratio is higher.

[19:21] Our absolute subscribers are higher.

[19:22] Options are higher.

[19:23] Books sales are higher.

[19:24] Applications are higher.

[19:26] And it's about stuff I like making.

[19:27] So I'm like, I'm thrilled to do this.

[19:29] I'm stoked.

[19:29] And I get to make this stuff about like we can do more content

[19:32] because I don't have to put as much post into it for you guys.

[19:34] So like, you guys said, it's more distracting

[19:36] to have the wisdomings and the effects.

[19:37] And we're like, cool.

[19:39] I'm happy to just talk business.

[19:41] So this is what we're doing now.

[19:43] So one big belief we have is volume and a gates lock.

[19:45] That's in the sales team locker room,

[19:47] same thing in the media team.

[19:48] It's that we will create more.

[19:52] And we would just basically have constraints

[19:54] on where like the direction of what we're creating.

[19:57] But we will keep making as much as we can

[19:59] in different ways to find out works

[20:01] even better than our first whack at it.

[20:04] The second thing is don't get the same scratch wise.

[20:06] We're super happy to make mistakes.

[20:07] I mean, it's funny, I almost mean that.

[20:12] Like it's totally fine making mistakes

[20:14] because like they're not mistakes.

[20:16] They're just lessons.

[20:17] What we don't want is get the same scar twice.

[20:20] And so if we find out, or we know

[20:23] that I have to introduce myself,

[20:24] then I better keep introducing myself.

[20:26] If we know that high, high-five production

[20:30] doesn't do as well with business owners,

[20:32] then I better not do that, right?

[20:35] Unless there's a conclusion that we find that's wrong about that.

[20:37] But for now, we're not going to make the same mistake twice.

[20:40] And so I'm happy to make all the mistakes

[20:42] there are in a very narrow field.

[20:43] That's what makes it an expert.

[20:45] But I just want to make it twice.

[20:47] A third one, this is super tactical,

[20:48] is that slides versus just me heavily prepping for a presentation.

[20:52] Hasn't made us as much of a difference.

[20:54] So I try to approximate this by like my best videos

[20:57] that were most views and most business center

[21:00] in terms of CPMs, was me presenting out of conference.

[21:03] So I have a stage in my headquarters.

[21:05] And so I was like, all right, I'm going to present on my stage.

[21:07] But it was not too many of you who are who is to my team.

[21:10] But like a lot of conference are like,

[21:12] is this guy pretending to be on stage?

[21:14] And so if you did see that, that's why the room was kind of empty.

[21:18] But I was trying to approximate as much of that style of video.

[21:22] So that gives you maybe a little bit insight.

[21:24] I was like, okay, what kind of control?

[21:25] I can do a stage, we can do the lighting,

[21:26] we can have the seats, I can have slides,

[21:28] these are all things that I'm used to doing.

[21:29] Now it worked to degree, but we got the same performance

[21:31] from me just talking to a camera like this

[21:33] and going over the slides without the stage,

[21:36] or me just doing whiteboard,

[21:37] walking through the concepts of the tactics

[21:40] to grow or solve a problem.

[21:41] Number four, show what only you can show

[21:45] and say what only you can say.

[21:47] And so I have a few marketing isms

[21:50] that I have never heard anywhere else that are very real for me.

[21:54] One is state the facts and tell the truth.

[21:55] It's always that way.

[21:56] Because then you never get in trouble,

[21:58] you have to worry about anything.

[21:58] You don't have to worry about claims,

[21:59] you just state the facts and tell the truth.

[22:00] All show me that you have to go collect data,

[22:02] so you can state the truth.

[22:04] And so a second one or anything that is say what only we can say

[22:07] and show it only we can show.

[22:08] It's demonstration, right?

[22:09] And so if obviously I have accomplishments

[22:13] that I can say, hey, I know what I'm talking about,

[22:16] but there's also labor.

[22:17] And so I can say, hey, I built 8 million personal audience,

[22:22] listen to this stuff for content,

[22:24] which by the way, you don't have to listen to any of it,

[22:25] there's just work for me.

[22:27] Or I can say I made 35,000 posts, independent of the outcome.

[22:31] And so what I want to do is do more work than anyone else will do

[22:35] so that I can show what no one else can show

[22:37] and say what no one's gonna say.

[22:39] And so if you're starting out or you're,

[22:40] you're a different part in your journey,

[22:42] considering like, okay, why can't out come anyone yet?

[22:45] Because I'm early, but you cannot work people.

[22:48] And so I can't just say like, I mean, 35,000 posts,

[22:50] what I learned.

[22:51] I'm gonna compress a lot of time for you.

[22:52] That's valuable, no matter who you are.

[22:54] And number five is still doing wide short.

[22:57] So this is interesting.

[22:59] So we thought about this and we decided that for shorts,

[23:04] we're willing to go a little bit wider.

[23:06] And I'll tell you why.

[23:07] So I run ads and Layla runs ads using our face.

[23:13] And I actually see the main ROI from shorts

[23:16] as top of funnel brand awareness.

[23:18] And when I say brand awareness,

[23:19] I really just mean like facial recognition.

[23:20] People will see my face and remember that they got some sort of value from it.

[23:24] And in a short, it's more difficult to get into really deep business concepts,

[23:29] which is what I'm not states impossible.

[23:32] And maybe I just need to up my skills, which is totally fine.

[23:36] But we're still maintaining a certain percentage of shorts

[23:39] that I would consider to be more like a little bit wider.

[23:42] Because I tend to like business philosophy too,

[23:43] and I don't want to stop.

[23:44] What are things I like talking about?

[23:46] Like philosophy.

[23:47] I like wide business concepts.

[23:49] I like personal development shit

[23:50] and sort of in terms of productivity,

[23:53] which is kind of a wider topic.

[23:55] But I'm not going to stop doing that,

[23:56] because I do like making that stuff.

[23:57] And so I'll probably keep having shorts around that,

[24:00] because the ROI is actually not from shorts turning into book sales,

[24:04] or shirts turning into options.

[24:06] It's actually the shorts getting retargeted later

[24:09] with an ad that does go to something

[24:11] but they're going to be more likely to recognize me

[24:14] and then take the next step and whatever the funnel is.

[24:17] Whether we're saying, hey, if you're starting a business,

[24:19] go check out school, which by the way, again,

[24:20] wide, someone's trying to start a business,

[24:23] then it makes sense for it to be a little bit wider

[24:25] for people who are trying to get into it.

[24:26] And so then the school lets can hit those people

[24:28] and it makes sense for them to use school.

[24:30] Right?

[24:32] If it's a business owner,

[24:35] I still think that from a business perspective,

[24:36] we have a lot of business cuts

[24:37] in terms of our shorts.

[24:38] But I want to just address this in case you see it

[24:40] so you're not confused about it.

[24:42] I still have some wide content in short form

[24:45] because of the reason I just said.

[24:47] And so those are the kind of like the next steps

[24:50] and if you guys find these kind of updates valuable

[24:52] with the metrics behind it,

[24:54] the TLDR of this whole video is that what we said worked.

[25:02] And if you're an educator,

[25:04] toss out the views, focus on your customer,

[25:07] make stuff for them because like saying cash,

[25:10] views and cash, cash is cash.

[25:12] And so if you're trying to grow your business,

[25:13] make sure you're making the stuff for the people

[25:15] you actually want to make, not here you go.

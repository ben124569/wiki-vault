[00:00] I gave away $2 million personally donated to after school all stars in the form of cash and

[00:07] an actual physical product so we gave 250,000 bands like Workout Bands, like Digital Wands,

[00:13] you know what I mean like fit fit bits, 250,000 kind of fit bits to kids in under-proglish

[00:19] city so we can encourage them to get fit and healthy and we donated 1.2 million to fund the staffing.

[00:27] And I can truthfully tell you that when I did that I did it because I wanted to feel better

[00:32] and I can tell you now that it didn't actually make me feel that much better.

[00:35] I share that because I don't know how many people would say that and I just want to keep this

[00:42] keep this channel 100% real. I think a lot of times it leased for me like I want to do things because

[00:47] I want to find meaning and I had a really really interesting conversation and so the other day I had

[00:53] four hour conversation with I'll say a friend of mine but I consider him a friend hopefully you

[00:58] consider me a friend. Dr. John Barardi and he sold his company of the majority of

[01:03] stake in his company for over nine figures and he doesn't do anything right now actively.

[01:07] I've had two unbelievable conversations with John and I'm always very grateful for my time with him.

[01:12] There were two statements that he made through that four hours that have stuck with me

[01:16] since then and one from the former conversation that I had within that really kind of changed my

[01:21] life and my outlook and from the first conversation what he talked about was how he said you need to

[01:28] look at things and consume content for people who are outside of the matrix and I was like what do you

[01:33] mean by that? He was like everyone's inside of the matrix. Everyone is trying to make money.

[01:40] Right? Everyone's trying to make money. They're operating from a place of scarcity. They're operating

[01:44] from a place of desire of wanting something more than what they currently have and whenever they're

[01:50] doing that they're operating from a different energy level and I don't think you use that exact

[01:54] word but that's kind of how I perceived it and that was my big takeaway from the first one and I

[01:58] think that between my first conversation my second was about six or nine months. I'm feeling this

[02:02] kind of shift that's happening within us as we as we start this channel and we write the book

[02:09] which you guys if you haven't heard of it's under really dollar offers it's got a lot of good reviews.

[02:14] It's nine and nine cents I made it nine and nine cents because I want everybody to be able to

[02:17] afford it that's as cheap as Jeffie B will let me do it. Anyway so I had this conversation with John

[02:22] and the first question I asked him when I shifted the conversation to kind of personal stuff I said

[02:28] now that you know you've made what you have major exit I was like you know how how do you

[02:34] create and destroy meaning? He was like huh that's an interesting question and I was like like

[02:38] in work like how do you create and destroy meaning and the things that you work on and he

[02:41] paused and he looked at me and I felt like he was staring into my soul and he was like

[02:45] why do you think work needs to be meaningful? I was like oh okay and this is why I love talking to

[02:51] people who are outside of the matrix right there's so much perspective and later in the conversation

[02:57] I was like well then outside of work you know like how do you gain meaning and he's like why do you

[03:01] think work why do you think life needs to be meaningful and he's like just hold for a second so

[03:07] if you say that life has to be meaningful then what happens is you create this desire right that life

[03:12] might be a certain way which means we're not accepting life as it currently is and as soon as we say

[03:16] that life has to be a certain way it must be meaningful then we create this deficit this deficiency

[03:20] between where we are and where we want to be and so in so doing we create the deficiency that we're

[03:24] trying to avoid by saying it must be a certain way and I was like oh god and so it just made me

[03:30] realize a lot of the you know in the in the in the book I think my first book Jim Longejikritz which is a

[03:37] for transparency this book is for all businesses but my first book was a Jim book and I think the

[03:42] opening passage says it's from Orson Scott card we question all of our beliefs except for those

[03:47] that we truly believe and those we never think to question at all and I always take that to heart

[03:51] because the beliefs that we truly hold dear the ones that we don't they operate in the background

[03:56] of our minds there are assumptions that we make on how the world is and how it's supposed to be

[04:02] how it must be how it should be right what we have to do right I'm like I must create meaning I should

[04:08] work should be meaningful but by creating that I end up creating an equation of deficiency which then

[04:16] ends up making or forcing myself to not experience that right and so I'll tell you quick story

[04:22] so when I was in college I dated a girl who was really really obsessed with happiness and

[04:28] she might be completely over this chapter in the life from she is but at the time she's really into happiness

[04:33] and positive psychology even major in pie self psychology so everything was always like

[04:36] does this make me happy does this make me happy does this make me happy right so it's like we're

[04:40] studying for things like this is make me happy and so for me I ended up actually getting

[04:44] really sick of that concept because I felt like I was always analyzing me like no like this doesn't make me

[04:49] happy right I got so frustrated with it I got so in my head about like happiness happiness happiness

[04:55] that I remember that I gave myself the mantra fuck happiness and so as soon as I said this is how

[05:02] I'm going to live I was like fuck happiness I'm just going to get you done and I'm going to move forward

[05:07] I feel like I ended up actually experiencing more joy in the work that I was doing I didn't

[05:12] realize this but as as we kind of reached another quote mountain top or whatever you want to call it as we've

[05:16] kind of succeeded in business and whatnot we I created another happiness placeholder right which I now

[05:24] called meaning or fulfillment right by doing that I created yet another equation of deficiency in my own

[05:30] life which is always analyzing my work and saying is this meaningful do I get fulfillment from this and

[05:35] all of that kind of jazz but for me what is happening is like if I go donate all this money

[05:40] and I feel nothing I feel like I'm I failed right and and then the question is like when you donate

[05:46] are you should you feel better I assumed that I was supposed to feel better right feel good

[05:53] but I didn't this has been kind of the the thing that I am doing right now at least is what I'm

[05:58] thinking through so I'm sharing this with the channel it has been I use the word it's been meaning

[06:03] for me to give myself the excuse or give myself permission rather to not find meaning in things

[06:13] and that has been unbelievably frame which is just giving myself permission to work on things that

[06:20] I may or may not find meaning for but to simply do the thing and I think that for me

[06:26] giving myself permission to not find meaning has allowed me to accept reality as it currently is

[06:32] and by accepting it is it currently ends is I have I do not have a deficiency that I must resolve

[06:37] between where I am and where I think it should be and by doing that I have I have you know I've just

[06:46] enjoyed the process more so I'll put it that way I have less less anxiety around those things

[06:50] not to see that anxiety is bad it is a human condition or part of the human condition

[06:55] but it is been something that I've experienced by by first saying fuck happiness earlier in my

[06:59] life and then creating meaning as the new happiness thing that I should be striving for and again

[07:04] I think now it's removing meaning or destroying the idea that something should be meaning for

[07:08] or should not be meaningful that has been very very valuable for me simply focusing on the work

[07:14] at hand and doing it well according to my values which is whether this is meaning for or not

[07:21] the way that I choose to live is according to these values and is the way that I am completing

[07:27] this work is the way that I am showing up on this meeting is the way that I am conducting myself

[07:31] is the way that I am making this decision in alignment with those values and in thinking like that

[07:36] I feel like I am able to do it in the present rather than in the future I'm able to walk

[07:42] with the values that I choose rather than try and pursue meaning in and of itself which created

[07:51] a deficit between where I was and where I wanted to go which created a negative experience again

[07:57] not that negative experience or bad but I have a preference of not having them if I can avoid them

[08:02] I show you this I know this is a little bit more heavy than more more of my natural stuff talk about

[08:05] money but I guess I make this because I know a lot of entrepreneurs are like me hopefully

[08:10] maybe not not hopefully like me but hopefully they're just like themselves but if you were like me in

[08:14] that you strive for these things I can tell you that I got no more meaning from giving lots of money

[08:21] away at all taking the actions that I am taking with the intention of being a line with the values

[08:31] that I find meaningful has been the thing that has been truly freeing for me mentally

[08:38] and I make this channel because it feels in alignment with my values I wrote the book

[08:44] and the books because they are in alignment with my values you know building acquisition.com

[08:49] and taking interest in the companies that we do in our portfolio has been in alignment with the

[08:53] values rather than saying is this company meaningful is my work with this company meaningful because

[09:00] here's the one that really gets me tricked up and this is also something that John brought up which is like

[09:05] admitting that and again this may be contrary to a lot of people's religious beliefs I don't

[09:08] mean to offend anyone that is not my intention here but my belief my viewpoint of the world

[09:13] is that when we die nothing happens and when you and legacy is a myth and so when the idea of

[09:21] taking money and then having my kids right then have something I think that ruins people I think

[09:26] wealth without the skill of acquiring the wealth is like my favorite magic card of all time

[09:31] magic the gathering there's a card called burning wish the flavor text on the card is she

[09:36] wished for a weapon but for not the skill to wield it and I always thought that was so profound

[09:41] because when you give I feel like money is power right it's just raw energy that you can either

[09:47] you know create hospitals you can build bombs with it whatever you want you can do it with money

[09:51] but if you don't have the skill of learning how to master in wield money which is really just

[09:56] learning how to get it to flow to you if you don't have that skill that those traits right if you

[10:02] get it it's like having all this raw power and I think it ruins people and so I already knew

[10:06] Lailanae already decided and we just signed our will this is probably why this is top of mine for me

[10:10] I said we signed our wills a few days ago and when we did that I realized that we don't have kids and

[10:17] everything that I've a master was probably going to become a pretty big fortune when we die I'm just

[10:23] donating anyways because I believe that even if I did have kids one I wouldn't give it to them

[10:28] and if I did choose to give it to him here's how I think how crazy this is from a legacy standpoint

[10:32] a hundred generations from now you're diluting your gene pool you know a hundred multiplied like

[10:37] factored right and so it's like you know cutting by half cutting by half cutting by half cutting by half

[10:43] times a hundred right and that's assuming that humans are still around a hundred generations from now

[10:47] but if they were I'm still not even anyway related to these people and I kind of ruin them anyways

[10:52] because I'm giving them wealth that they don't control and don't understand how it was generated right and they

[10:56] definitely know what the word who I was not that that's that I need that but like just being real

[11:01] and the other alternative is that in a hundred generations there won't be any humans right and in that case

[11:06] then the legacy doesn't matter either and so that was what was kind of like my ultimate wrap around with this

[11:12] of meaning is that nothing inherently has meaning which also also gives us the power

[11:17] to create and destroy meaning as we see fit but more importantly to rise above meaning and say

[11:22] why am I saying that things should or should not be meaningful and answering and examining that

[11:27] question has been very valuable for me as an entrepreneur because in some ways it's freed up a lot of

[11:31] my attention because of this continued obsession I had or that I have tendencies towards only doing things

[11:37] that are meaningful when in fact I feel like my an easier thing that has been useful for me has been

[11:43] am I doing things that are in alignment with my values and those values to me are meaningful in

[11:49] and of themselves and that is all and they don't have to be that way they shouldn't be that way but for me

[11:55] doing actions in that way rather than putting it and casting in the future has been a useful

[11:59] mental exercise and so I don't know where you're at near journey but my name is Alex Shemozi

[12:04] you're going to perform a of companies to do about $85 million a year my goal with acquisition.com is to

[12:10] help entrepreneurs build their businesses and you know get financial freedom the way that we

[12:16] structured everything is I give away everything so the course is the books this book you can get for

[12:20] 99 cents I have this the first of a big series of volumes that I'm making of the real stuff that

[12:26] actually help us build these companies and then with the hopes that we can help invest in some of the

[12:32] bigger ones that that succeed using those materials so anyways lots of love keeping amazing and

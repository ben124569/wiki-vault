## Full Transcript
[00:00] I'm here with 10 business owners doing between 1 million and 10 million dollars for a year

[00:03] and we're talking about the things that are holding them back to scale their companies

[00:07] and join. What are your biggest issues right now with growing business too?

[00:11] Thank you so much for your question for us.

[00:12] I've got no enough ads, no enough creatives.

[00:15] I think the Mages have been opened to what I actually teach to scale out the closing

[00:19] campaigns.

[00:20] Basically we have skewed our entire program on single image,

[00:25] should lead for my ads on like that.

[00:28] That's cool.

[00:28] Thank you, sir.

[00:29] Lenten advertising.

[00:30] So you have professional spots.

[00:32] Yeah, it's time to be direct with them.

[00:33] Speaking of, I didn't really well with the lead qualities and the Mages.

[00:36] Okay, what's else you've been a character?

[00:38] Yeah, so this has been slightly less calculated because we completely revamped our business

[00:43] in the last 30 months.

[00:44] From what I could gather is about 3.7 and but that's not capturing the people who are

[00:50] actually staying longer and more.

[00:51] So I think it's slightly high.

[00:53] Well, we can say that with the B-plank set.

[00:56] Yeah, okay.

[00:58] Yeah, got it.

[00:59] So what do you charge in?

[01:01] And actually we have 1 progum for those 3 payments,

[01:04] a fee package, a 3 month section month, 12 months, 2k, 3k, 5k.

[01:09] Okay, 2k, 3k, 5k.

[01:13] Got it. What do you have?

[01:14] If it's one thing with just different timelines,

[01:16] do you just start high and then work your way down?

[01:18] Is that all?

[01:19] No, I just present for the open standard interaction.

[01:22] Okay.

[01:24] What's the most common goal?

[01:26] And 12, you losing 30 pounds,

[01:29] 6 month control down to that and the most popular bad night.

[01:31] Yeah, so I mean, this is super tactical, but obviously I've done a lot of fitness sales.

[01:37] I probably just switched to a diagnostic sale.

[01:40] Okay. So basically you say,

[01:42] what was the 12 month price?

[01:45] 5k.

[01:46] Yeah, so I would probably do something like

[01:49] 129 a week, something like that.

[01:51] And then just say, okay, cool.

[01:53] So you're here, you want to get here.

[01:55] That's, you know, you're 200, you want to be 160, it's 40 pounds.

[01:59] And so that's, we lose comfortably a pound a week and that includes kind of a

[02:04] recon period at the end, kind of like bringing back to maintenance,

[02:07] blah, blah, blah, blah.

[02:09] And so that'll take us 40 weeks.

[02:11] And so 40 weeks times 129 boom.

[02:13] And that way and the key part is that as soon as you do that,

[02:16] you're selling to goal rather than selling programs,

[02:18] you'll convert away our percentage of people.

[02:20] And then that's where I gave my, um, the whole, uh, if you don't hit the goal by that point,

[02:27] I'll keep working with you until you do provided you x, y, and z.

[02:30] And that merrows.

[02:32] And that looks then I translate that which means that when you buy this,

[02:36] you'll be that way, whether it takes this time or this time, you'll get there.

[02:39] And as soon as I said that, we're like, done here. Here's the card.

[02:43] Yeah.

[02:44] So I would just do that as like thing, thing one.

[02:48] But in terms of the altitude, so that'll probably help LTV a little bit because you'll,

[02:52] and if you like need to extend time to make the contract higher, just have like longer maintenance periods.

[02:59] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[03:00] And then it's fine. Yeah, I'll leave it there.

[03:03] You do supplement sales, do you have any affiliate thing for supplements?

[03:06] We do, no.

[03:07] Okay, I would add that in because you can usually get another 50% in supplement sales

[03:11] because people want to get all the fancy due dads and there's zero delivery for you.

[03:15] And they want the recommendation.

[03:17] And so like literally you just hand them the product, you make this split and you just move on into life.

[03:21] And don't sell it on the first package sell it on the second.

[03:24] So you do your diagnostic, meet with them 48 hours later for nutrition control,

[03:29] then try and sell probably 500,000 bucks in supplements, 100% more.

[03:33] Would you have a serious person to say, I'd go?

[03:35] No, I just same same guy.

[03:37] He was like, cool, we're going to walk through.

[03:38] And first half is nutrition control.

[03:40] And then the second half you basically bake in, hey, I want you to take this at this time.

[03:43] And you want to do like an assumed close, which is like, I need to take this in this and then you go into their habits.

[03:47] So it's like, what are you doing the morning, what are you doing the afternoon?

[03:51] So you have your coffee and the morning, four thing, okay, I want you put these three supplements next to your coffee.

[03:54] I would forget it.

[03:55] Okay, where are you going to be going to the gym?

[03:57] Okay, I want you to put your pre-work out your post-wargite in your car that we don't forget it.

[04:00] Okay, you can take two scripts of that.

[04:02] This one, great. By the way, Juniors of the car, you have them filed for this.

[04:05] Awesome. I'll have them shipped to your house.

[04:07] Hey, Trans.

[04:08] Cool. But yeah, that'll just make you more money.

[04:11] But the issue we're talking about is you growing your business.

[04:19] Won't you spend a more money on that?

[04:21] And we do find we struggle to kind of, that remain 12 for the whole once we start again.

[04:26] I was like, shall he not need the day and I spend so again the bottleneck was meeting and I found.

[04:31] Yeah, that's it.

[04:32] Yeah, so that's kind of what I came to have from the last couple of days.

[04:36] We aren't bringing the sales team in as well.

[04:39] So I've been treating those guys and that's been on level by the constraint, but the closure cost for a percent.

[04:45] Yeah, so that's like a trend.

[04:46] You shouldn't be the action.

[04:48] It's a trend.

[04:48] Yeah, yeah, that's that's cool. Awesome.

[04:52] All right, rock and roll.

[04:53] Cross-wild.

[04:54] So my main constraint right now is the quality of the leads we're getting.

[04:59] We're getting a leather leads, but there are low set areas basically profiles.

[05:04] And we need, so we compensate implementing our one or two sales process.

[05:10] You know, like, well, if we have all 10 minutes and then you go on this.

[05:14] And so what we are trying to do is to get to the highest that I reason with more seniority.

[05:19] Where the ROI for our office is better.

[05:24] So we are thinking about changing the platform where we spend our ads.

[05:29] We're spending around 10,000, but a bit more on meta ads on the.

[05:35] And maybe switch to LinkedIn or Twitter.

[05:37] I mean, LinkedIn is for sure, murder for what you're looking for.

[05:41] Like, I mean, you're looking for executives who want severance packages.

[05:46] Oh, code to outreach.

[05:47] Oh, what?

[05:48] Code to that would reach.

[05:49] Code outreach.

[05:50] I mean, I would, I would do LinkedIn.

[05:52] If I had to do this in order, I would want, I wouldn't turn off from it ads.

[05:56] I would, yeah, I wouldn't, like, don't stop the flow.

[05:59] Like, keep it, like you're making money with it, right?

[06:02] So then just make more money by doing the same thing on top.

[06:05] Like, don't stop that.

[06:07] Okay.

[06:09] Just so it's my mind to say, you know, your past.

[06:11] Oh, there's a lot of things.

[06:13] But what's the return on this one again?

[06:15] I know you told me less than I come over.

[06:17] Three to one.

[06:17] But we talked about just adding the performance piece.

[06:20] So if you added the performance piece and you're doing 10, no one would you care?

[06:24] And we'll be fine.

[06:25] Yeah.

[06:25] I mean, I can.

[06:26] Sure.

[06:27] You can be fine as long.

[06:28] Well, then it's only SSS.

[06:30] If you were getting 10 to one, would you spend more on meta?

[06:34] We tried to spend more, but then the, the, the,

[06:37] is some diminishing returns.

[06:38] Well, of course.

[06:39] But now you got 10 to one, but then you can get three to one with 10 times as bad.

[06:43] Well, we need to do more creative.

[06:45] We need to do more creative every week.

[06:47] Okay.

[06:48] So I think, so we talked about this last night, but I think that you add in that performance

[06:52] thing would be like step one.

[06:54] And I think that that takes you from three K to like 10 K or 12 K, right?

[06:59] Per customer, right?

[07:01] So that takes you from one to three or three to one to 12 to one.

[07:04] If you just made that one change.

[07:07] So the diminishing return, which goes from three to one to two to one,

[07:11] means you go from 12 to one to nine to one.

[07:17] So you're still killing.

[07:19] Right.

[07:20] So sure, I'll bet you ask you to use work.

[07:22] Sure, just been tangerine about your not spending money anyways.

[07:25] But I would do that first before I even start another platform.

[07:31] Because you might just be fine and just need to like tweak the ultimate.

[07:35] Okay.

[07:35] Just do that.

[07:36] Okay.

[07:37] So yeah.

[07:39] Cool.

[07:40] Biggest concern right now, sales.

[07:44] Sales manager left.

[07:45] You know, because he was not a good cultural festival.

[07:49] He was a basketball player.

[07:50] Or you weren't as one.

[07:51] He's the good guy.

[07:52] Who knows?

[07:53] Yeah.

[07:53] Who knows?

[07:55] Yeah, the plot thickens.

[07:56] But he left.

[07:58] Top closer became sales manager.

[08:00] Second top closer left went to another offer.

[08:03] So sales went from, you know, one top closer becomes manager.

[08:07] Yeah.

[08:08] As a song is old as time.

[08:10] Yeah.

[08:11] Okay.

[08:11] So it's a really a sales problem right now.

[08:13] Yeah.

[08:14] That we have.

[08:15] And Laila was just up there.

[08:17] Telling somebody to like, hey, you need to go back in the sales.

[08:20] I just don't have the expertise.

[08:21] And he's sales.

[08:22] So my solution is that higher sales director on top of the sales manager.

[08:28] I mean, you did whole selling for a long time.

[08:30] Like you know this all.

[08:32] Yeah.

[08:32] You also believe in the product.

[08:33] Well, how many, how many deals you're doing a month?

[08:35] Right now.

[08:36] So we were doing around 70.

[08:38] Now we're doing around 40.

[08:40] Okay.

[08:41] Yeah.

[08:42] That'd be tough for you to take over the cost.

[08:43] But you're saying you don't have the expertise to be a sales director.

[08:48] Basically.

[08:48] I mean, I'm pretty much doing it.

[08:50] I mean, you're doing it now.

[08:51] Yeah.

[08:51] I'm doing it now.

[08:52] It's just like, do I let?

[08:55] Yeah.

[08:55] How deep do I get into it?

[08:56] Or do I find somebody else who has?

[08:58] Because all the other departments I have a director who.

[09:00] So is lead flow the same?

[09:02] Anyone from closing 70 to closing 40.

[09:04] Yeah.

[09:04] Right.

[09:05] Right.

[09:05] And it's really now the remaining team is closing in the same percentage.

[09:08] And just the two best guys left.

[09:10] Yes, except now that this sales manager, this top-boast

[09:15] became sales manager.

[09:16] It's almost like a respect thing.

[09:18] Like he's not a very good coach in my opinion.

[09:22] Of course not.

[09:22] He's the best closer to go.

[09:23] Yeah.

[09:24] And so that's kind of what the issue is.

[09:27] And then those, if they're hearing.

[09:29] Yeah, 100 trying to farm.

[09:30] Yeah.

[09:31] Yeah.

[09:32] Trying to develop people.

[09:33] I just want to kill people.

[09:35] Yeah.

[09:35] It's like also like they were all as competition.

[09:37] Like, as we could go up and now he's like now I'm going to help you.

[09:39] Fuck you.

[09:41] Is he still on the phones?

[09:42] The director?

[09:43] Yeah.

[09:43] Right.

[09:44] So one, I'm sure she probably told you

[09:47] like Donald promote the sales directors.

[09:50] This sales guy, when you did say where you're like,

[09:52] are we going to try this out?

[09:53] Uh, I said there's, oh, so that last sales manager was paying him

[09:58] under the table to do like call reviews.

[10:01] Do this thing that.

[10:02] So then I was like, well, a lot of the fucking I've been this guy.

[10:05] When you're doing all the work.

[10:07] And then he became sales manager.

[10:09] And now it's, yeah.

[10:11] I'm so worried about this whole thing.

[10:14] Um, okay.

[10:15] But he was, so he was closing and doing this stuff.

[10:18] And he was closing great.

[10:19] And now that he's no longer closing his dude.

[10:20] He's just dead.

[10:21] He was just doing call reviews right back.

[10:23] Oh, okay.

[10:23] So just reviewing their calls with them.

[10:26] Yes.

[10:27] Okay.

[10:28] So, um, all right.

[10:31] So I'll walk through it.

[10:33] Okay.

[10:33] Somebody give you like sales training one on this.

[10:35] But um, I honestly just think everyone sucks at sales training.

[10:40] So I don't think it's a, you think anything like that.

[10:42] I think literally like 95% comes up.

[10:44] No idea how to train sales.

[10:45] And they just hire sales people and hope for the best.

[10:48] And then they just like talk at them and hope that they get better.

[10:51] But have zero measurable improvement to show that they can actually take someone and make them better.

[10:58] So that's like a side, side grants on that.

[11:00] But um, people get better at sales by watching a ton of games.

[11:06] Like, you can say if people who sell well want by modeling just like children learn anything.

[11:10] And then too, by corrective, very immediate role playing.

[11:14] Like when this happens, what do you say?

[11:16] And so they say great.

[11:17] Say it again like this.

[11:18] Try again.

[11:19] Awesome.

[11:19] Keep going.

[11:20] Try again.

[11:21] Great.

[11:21] One more time.

[11:22] Again.

[11:23] And that's it.

[11:23] And you just really drill one aspect of the script until they breathe it.

[11:27] And they're like, I get it.

[11:28] I get it.

[11:28] I get it.

[11:29] I'm not like, and then you're like great.

[11:30] Now we work on the second part of the script.

[11:32] And you just work your way down until they like, they breathe.

[11:35] And think it and then can't do anything.

[11:37] But that way, they can actually listen on the call because they're not thinking about

[11:40] they're going to say next time.

[11:43] And so you need somebody who like really, really loves sales people.

[11:46] And like, wants to teach an investing people, which is not usually the personality of a sales killer.

[11:52] Every once in a while, you'll have an absolute savage.

[11:56] But it's usually not that person.

[11:57] It's like, the salesman who's like a killer killer is not that guy.

[12:01] And those guys usually crush on sales.

[12:03] There's a different type of closer who's like really attentive and like very caring.

[12:07] And those guys can also go.

[12:08] And there's sometimes are the ones who can become really good sales managers, but it's a different

[12:12] person.

[12:13] Like Jacob, if you met Jacob, are there?

[12:18] Right.

[12:18] Like he closes exceptionally well.

[12:22] When he was at Jim launch, and like he worked his way up from the call for to the setting team,

[12:26] to the closing team beat all grown as men and he was selling to 42-year-old Jim.

[12:31] So like about two months.

[12:35] And then, was able to train because it was like I just want to help the guys out.

[12:40] You know, like I understand what's struggling with, like let's just work on this.

[12:43] And it's more about like I just want to win it whatever I do, not because I am of psychopath,

[12:48] which the one like you know how I'm talking about, like the butcher, if the lavican.

[12:53] Like we've all had those guys.

[12:55] So your problem, sales, lead flows the same.

[13:01] So should you hire or should you get in as the question?

[13:04] Correct.

[13:06] I think you should get in.

[13:08] You have a sales driven business.

[13:10] You're the CEO.

[13:11] You shouldn't have how it works.

[13:14] You're going to keep running this issue.

[13:15] And whoever runs sales, I'm going to have levered over here.

[13:17] And so you know how to do it.

[13:21] Like if a sales director, because you might have sales director,

[13:23] can you be like, no one can run this team like me.

[13:27] If you don't double my pay, I'm leaving.

[13:29] I feel like, like I can name 10 people here.

[13:34] Like in this building, you can do better than you.

[13:35] It's a trained-off.

[13:36] You know what I mean?

[13:37] And so what happens, so what happens from the team you had and then I'll go to Jacob,

[13:47] is you basically brought as many people as you could in,

[13:51] saw who could sell and then just let them sell.

[13:53] It's how most people do it.

[13:54] I think wrong with that.

[13:56] What happens though is that there's no process.

[13:58] And so basically it's just whatever way you know how to sell sell.

[14:02] It creates difficulty on the CS side because everyone kind of promises a little bit differently.

[14:06] Some people sell hot there, promise, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[14:09] And so even if you do try and train, no one's following the script to be in one.

[14:12] So the training's irrelevant.

[14:14] And so basically like step one if you have to turn on a sales team is like,

[14:18] everyone follow the script.

[14:19] The script becomes like the script becomes the Bible.

[14:21] It's like, if this is word of God, now that means that if you follow the script perfectly

[14:26] and they don't close, you crush it.

[14:28] Because if I get everyone following the script,

[14:29] now we can tweak the script because that actually changes everyone says it.

[14:34] Let me ask that.

[14:36] So otherwise if no one says the script is going to be in one,

[14:38] why do you even bother having the script?

[14:40] Gotcha.

[14:40] And so do you think it's going to be more script-script making, changing the flow of process and then

[14:45] training?

[14:45] Yes and making the script as simple as humanly possible.

[14:48] Okay.

[14:48] Most of the times when we look at the script we could have it.

[14:50] Got it.

[14:51] Is it me taking sales calls?

[14:53] I think it would, I think it would help you go.

[14:55] To better iterate the script.

[14:58] To that teach it.

[14:59] Cool.

[15:00] You'll bet that you there's parts of the script.

[15:02] You're like, we didn't have to have this.

[15:03] I took five calls.

[15:04] You're like, can you just skip over this whole thing?

[15:07] Why are you here?

[15:08] What's the problem?

[15:09] Gotcha.

[15:10] Cool.

[15:11] Yeah?

[15:11] Norris.

[15:12] It's a Naur.

[15:13] Auto sales.

[15:14] Did auto sales training or you do auto sales?

[15:17] Auto sales.

[15:18] Okay, got it.

[15:18] Got it.

[15:19] Do you have a dealership?

[15:20] Where do you?

[15:20] I was sweet.

[15:21] You used?

[15:22] No.

[15:22] Oh cool.

[15:23] How long you been in it?

[15:24] Eight years.

[15:25] Okay, you like it?

[15:27] I love it.

[15:27] Actually, I really do.

[15:31] Long story short.

[15:32] I've never been in sales.

[15:33] I was never a salesman.

[15:34] I was a bike theater.

[15:35] I pipe welder.

[15:37] I want some card and said, I'll hard.

[15:39] Gonna be.

[15:40] Yeah.

[15:40] And so I've just kind of been pilot driving through it.

[15:43] And you reset.

[15:45] I love it.

[15:46] Um, to hell the night here.

[15:48] It's awesome from pipe welding to, to have, you know,

[15:52] I know, I sell your, your number just great.

[15:55] So now I think the business,

[15:58] I keep in mind, Bravins, right?

[16:00] Um, sales processes,

[16:04] um, scripting.

[16:06] I talked to Jacob about that.

[16:08] Um, we don't, like, I, I can do it.

[16:12] But how to teach you how to do it?

[16:13] Like, that's how I feel.

[16:15] I don't know.

[16:16] You know, like, it's just go talk to them.

[16:17] Like, I don't, you know.

[16:18] Yeah.

[16:19] Um, so I think coming up with that plan.

[16:22] Um, um, the advertising piece, um, we've been branding

[16:29] for a long time.

[16:32] Probably long.

[16:33] I think I'm really kind of like me too.

[16:35] Well, like, like radio.

[16:37] We've been doing a lot of radio.

[16:38] And it's actually worked.

[16:40] I feel like, but I, I think dating into the social media stuff

[16:45] would kind of accelerate.

[16:47] Um, and I talked

[16:52] out of no the CEO got the, um, I don't remember.

[16:55] I talked to him.

[16:56] I've got commercial vans.

[16:58] Um, so I got kind of two, three, four, five facets of my business

[17:04] that we can do, like, I have access to like massive amounts of commercial vans.

[17:09] Um, and so I'm thinking I'm going to do like a specialized push on that

[17:15] and see how that does because my margins and the vans, you know,

[17:19] what I can sell a typical car for there's $2,000 a margin.

[17:24] This man, I can make anywhere from six to 12.

[17:26] Well, um, so why not so a hundred six to 12,000 dollar deals instead of a hundred

[17:33] $2,000.

[17:34] I'll create an amendment.

[17:35] Uh, yeah.

[17:36] So I think he said, you know, throw, throw money at it, test that.

[17:41] And, but because he said maybe you don't have the market to sell 30 vans a month

[17:47] in this in that local market.

[17:49] Yeah.

[17:49] I mean, if it's a profitable line, then yeah, why don't business?

[17:52] Um, so I think really it's just ironing out like from top to bottom,

[17:57] obviously we need more money, like I get to fill my position.

[18:01] I haven't really taken any money out.

[18:02] I've just like that's why we keep buying more cars.

[18:05] Well, yeah, we've gone from 15 to 30 to 45.

[18:09] Now we have a hundred on the lot.

[18:11] Yeah.

[18:11] Awesome.

[18:12] Plus I have a full time service shop.

[18:15] So I need to hire a mechanic.

[18:18] I'm working out a service writer.

[18:19] He's got to learn how to sell.

[18:22] I got the sales.

[18:23] But you know what I mean?

[18:24] So like the one thing I've realized with the auto sales with three people, it's super simple.

[18:31] Yeah.

[18:32] The minute you try to build like holy shit, you need a lot of money.

[18:35] Yeah.

[18:36] Wow.

[18:37] Yeah.

[18:37] I mean, I think like, you know, they're found once the franchise is cost for like a BMW franchise.

[18:42] You're like, they're unbelievable.

[18:43] They're super expensive.

[18:44] For you guys know, it's unbelievable expensive.

[18:47] Like, it's like what the 20, 30 million, something like that?

[18:50] Well, and then tomorrow they just shop with a truckload of tools that you've got to write

[18:55] a truckload.

[18:56] You've got to write a truckload.

[18:57] I'm wondering if it's for context like that's almost as much as it costs to start banking.

[19:00] Like, it's brought.

[19:01] But to be fair, like the whole financing arm is a part of the business.

[19:04] Anyways, okay, not to get into the car business too much.

[19:06] Okay.

[19:07] So biggest limiter on your business is so when you bought a branding, you bought a

[19:10] believe you brought up picking the products so I put up sales process.

[19:14] So honestly, I think it's in priorities.

[19:18] So it's like, okay, of the ones that we just went over, which is the biggest problem for

[19:23] the business.

[19:24] What's limiting you the most?

[19:25] To me, hearing all that when I hear like six problems, it's people.

[19:28] Any help?

[19:29] Yeah.

[19:30] And I, there was something in the first day was like, you don't have problems.

[19:35] You just need people.

[19:36] Yeah.

[19:37] Yeah.

[19:38] That thing is, but I need to be omitted like three smart people.

[19:42] Right.

[19:43] I'm serious.

[19:44] I mean, you need somebody who can run the whole mechanic division, the service department.

[19:48] You need somebody who can run that.

[19:49] And you can, somebody who can run the normal use car law.

[19:51] And then you can then take the access bin with them, be like, are I'm going to pursue

[19:54] this thing opportunity?

[19:55] They're like, you can't pursue a new opportunity.

[19:57] What you got, another new opportunity, which is the service business, which is

[20:00] spending up, you stuff to keep the wheels on, pun intended, the main, the core, you know,

[20:04] the core cash cow business.

[20:07] So I would be looking at how much, how much, you better you doing in the business?

[20:12] How much profit?

[20:13] So I didn't bring that number with it.

[20:17] I was looking through it.

[20:18] Oh, I think I think I'm around five, six hundred thousand.

[20:22] Okay.

[20:23] So I think you can get somebody.

[20:24] So one, honestly, man.

[20:26] I think, do you have a good finance person who works for you?

[20:29] Yeah.

[20:30] Okay.

[20:31] So I'll bet you right now.

[20:33] This is just me just talk, like, shouldn't that.

[20:35] I'll bet you could probably get close to doubling your margin, just from somebody

[20:39] who had some finance discipline, being like, let's look at all of these expenses and

[20:43] just do that as a regular discipline.

[20:44] At the very basic, I'd say, like, you could do that.

[20:47] Because you, I, I almost guarantee you can find 250,000 years from your top line versus

[20:52] your bottom line.

[20:53] And if you find that, then you can find that, like, you can bring someone in and say,

[20:57] find your salary.

[20:58] Like, to a good, a good controller or a good CFO, you just say, like, listen, I can't

[21:04] afford you.

[21:05] I'm willing to pay you this.

[21:06] You need to find your salary and cost in the next 90 days.

[21:10] And they'll find it.

[21:12] And they say, cool, I just bought you.

[21:13] Let's see what else we could find because I need help to invest.

[21:16] Find that carve that guy out too.

[21:19] So you're talking, I can, I'm hiring someone that's going to, like, just run the day

[21:26] today of the money.

[21:28] I think, I mean, the perfect hire for you would be somebody who's taken a business around

[21:31] that was, like, five to 10 million in sales, not the car sales, but, like, receivable

[21:38] right for the, for a dealership to 25 to 30 and has strong financial background.

[21:46] If you don't have that, then just the operations I would be helpful.

[21:50] The reason I would put the finance person first is because it's likely that they'll be

[21:53] able to carve themselves out and carve out the hole for the other guy who can then fill

[21:56] that up.

[21:57] The perfect guy would have both in be awesome.

[21:59] But if you can't find that guy, then it'd be like, I would want somebody from another

[22:02] car dealership who's been a little bit bigger as more finance this one.

[22:05] And I find someone who's grown and run, like, led one of those businesses and bring those

[22:13] guys in because that will free you up because, like, you can go get the, the van thing

[22:17] and you'll, if you have space, you'll pay for both of those guys.

[22:20] Well, I've, so I've already got 40 banks.

[22:22] I mean, you'll pay for, like, you'll make the money with your free time to cover their

[22:28] salaries.

[22:29] Yeah, exactly.

[22:30] I think you're at the point right now where you need to, you need to make a bet on trading,

[22:36] you need to buy some time for you back.

[22:39] And it's just that the time that you now need to buy is more expensive time.

[22:42] It's easy to make the early trades because it's like lower value skill.

[22:48] But as you get better, you have to, it's kind of like breaking into a new territory for

[22:51] ads.

[22:52] Like, people are like, I've never spent more than $5,000 a day.

[22:55] I've never spent more than $10,000 a day.

[22:56] I've never spent more than $100 a day in an ad.

[22:58] Like, you just, they're just like new territories and the same thing with talent.

[23:03] It's like, I've never paid someone $255 a day.

[23:05] I've never paid someone $500 a day.

[23:06] I've never paid someone $1,000 a day.

[23:07] I've never paid someone $1,000 a day.

[23:08] Like, they just become levels that you just get through.

[23:10] And then you find what different levels of talent are like.

[23:12] And so right now, I think you just have never paid someone what you're going to have to pay.

[23:16] This person who's not a salesperson.

[23:18] So I have, I have like a sales slash finding, like, we kind of do our own deals.

[23:24] I'm only going to move on to this one because I got 60.

[23:26] I want to hit everybody.

[23:27] But no, you're good.

[23:28] But hopefully that gives you some direction.

[23:30] Okay.

[23:31] Cool.

[23:32] Meeky.

[23:33] Let's rock.

[23:34] So pretty much.

[23:35] So last year, we've been steadily, like, 20% for a last year.

[23:39] What does it think about?

[23:41] About, we've built websites.

[23:43] Okay.

[23:44] So we do a digital media to start with the mostly marketing.

[23:51] How big is enterprise?

[23:53] Has to be, like, 1,000.

[23:56] And so, like, 1,000 employees, it's like has to be a million pay,

[23:59] as view per day, we're higher debt, kind of.

[24:01] Okay.

[24:02] It's a traffic.

[24:03] So it's like has to be custom-built every discusser build.

[24:06] There's a lot of innovation.

[24:07] It's like some banking companies marketing.

[24:09] Like, it's like, super quiet.

[24:11] How do you get it?

[24:12] I mean, well, we don't have time for that.

[24:13] But, like, very interesting.

[24:15] Okay.

[24:16] So you've got this, I, yeah, I totally want to hear the story.

[24:18] But we, well, not.

[24:20] So what's, what do you want to do?

[24:21] Like, what, what do we need to do to go your company?

[24:24] So, last year, new new clients.

[24:26] But within clients, they will add projects and expand.

[24:29] They want more people there.

[24:31] So like, those, we've been doing, but also we have two big wells.

[24:34] So we have two big companies that are like 90% of our revenues.

[24:38] So like, we wanted to not do that,

[24:42] because we had that experience, I think, year two, it's a great...

[24:45] Yeah, one leaves into, like...

[24:46] Yeah, we had that happen, because like, one of our clients got merged by new vision

[24:50] or some other companies, and then they kind of decided not to use us.

[24:53] But we quickly got another well, which is good.

[24:56] But we've been kind of having trying to...

[24:58] What did you do when you had to quickly get another well?

[25:01] Well, we were very, very successful.

[25:03] Yeah, we, like, really literally like, sell sales sales,

[25:06] and we, like, both of both of them...

[25:08] And then you're like, okay, now I've made enough money against,

[25:10] and now I don't need to do sales sales sales sales.

[25:12] Yeah, and also like, we both of our own, both owners are still very hands-on.

[25:16] So we do a lot of client work.

[25:18] So if the client...

[25:19] We take my phone, or do you mean you and...

[25:20] And the 50% of...

[25:21] Okay, you said put, okay.

[25:23] Like, the owner of acquisition account, originally.

[25:26] So co-founders, and then he and I, we had a third partner, but we have to buy them out.

[25:31] Okay, sorry.

[25:32] Okay.

[25:33] After that, so we, when there's a client work, that always takes president.

[25:37] So like, some of the things that we split it out, so he's doing sales, and, um,

[25:41] and financial, and I take care of marketing and HR and all the operations are kind of shared.

[25:47] Okay, including a comment, so when there's a client work that gets busy, like, one of us gets busy.

[25:54] So one, or whatever, the operation kind of gets behind.

[25:58] So that always happens.

[26:00] It's been our struggle to then, and we try to hire some people, but I didn't know too much about other departments.

[26:06] So like, the hiring didn't really work out.

[26:08] I kind of mentioned that too.

[26:09] You need division of roles between you and the co-founder.

[26:12] And then you need to not step over each other's, like, territory.

[26:16] And no one owns new businesses, just why you don't have new business.

[26:20] That's actually my question because because he's client got really busy, so he's on sales.

[26:25] So I felt like sales, I'm like, I can help, but normally we really separate it out.

[26:31] Because we figured it out that accountability actually worked better if he split it out.

[26:35] The divisions.

[26:37] So it worked out good, but last year for some, what?

[26:40] And by division, you mean you have one client here, the other client?

[26:43] So, oh no, no, I'm not that in.

[26:46] It takes like eight, eight sales is him.

[26:48] So like I wasn't really touching the sales part.

[26:51] And by sales, you mean like internal sales, like trying to upsell them and just get them to buy more shit from you.

[26:57] The outbound sales, actually.

[26:58] Outbound sales, but you're not getting any customers from that so far.

[27:01] Got it.

[27:02] So outbound is not, it's pretty dried up.

[27:04] So inbound, like, is that, I don't know the sales term to actually figure it out.

[27:08] And bounds like someone reaches out to you, outbound, you retow to them first.

[27:11] Yeah, so inbound has been fine, but like outbound hasn't been.

[27:14] So I mean, because we didn't want the two wells, we wanted to do more outbound sales,

[27:18] but that hasn't been successful all last year.

[27:21] And we're hearing that because he's a part of like a mastermind for agencies that last year was pretty bad.

[27:26] But I think that's kind of like a bullshit.

[27:28] You know, excuse that there should be some way to figure out we can get new clients.

[27:33] There is a way to get new clients.

[27:35] I promise you.

[27:36] But I wanted to figure out, like, well, so I don't think it's all his fault.

[27:39] But like, how can I convincingly put a measure that we can kind of like make sure this is done.

[27:44] So like, and it's also, we're both owners and like, we have a, we both are very responsible,

[27:51] but at the same time, do we need to have some sort of measure that we always kind of make sure that, hey,

[27:56] we still have to be this.

[27:58] I mean, this is our partnership work.

[28:00] Yeah.

[28:01] And so that's also why division of roles is important.

[28:06] And so if you're like, I will take over 100% of delivery if you go get as customers.

[28:11] And then if you don't get as customers, then one of us is unnecessary.

[28:16] And so I'm just be like really real.

[28:18] This is me just reading between the lines from what you're saying.

[28:21] Honestly, I just think like, when you need to go get a new client and get a new well, you got a new well fairly quickly.

[28:28] It sounds like, which means that if you need to go give us an, you know exactly what to do.

[28:33] You just aren't doing that.

[28:35] Right.

[28:36] Right.

[28:37] And so the question is why.

[28:39] And it means that one of you is satisfied with the a lot of income and the amount of work that they have right now, which I say is fine if you both agree on that.

[28:46] But if one of you doesn't agree on that, then you have conflict.

[28:49] And so that conflict turns into direct conflict or it turns into when you become a resentful.

[28:54] And so I prefer if you just, if you or the other person, whoever, just as like, we, like, the way that,

[29:01] I'll explain something that might be helpful for everybody.

[29:04] It really helped me out a lot.

[29:05] So, you guys know the difference between an insult and criticism?

[29:08] Help me a ton.

[29:10] So an insult is an attack on someone's character, right?

[29:12] You suck.

[29:13] You are an idiot.

[29:14] Whatever.

[29:15] A criticism is, you said this.

[29:18] You did this.

[29:20] These are not the same.

[29:21] Right.

[29:22] It's a description between stated and reality.

[29:24] It's all this.

[29:25] So you said you would hit this goal.

[29:27] This is reality.

[29:28] There's a difference.

[29:30] So this is criticism.

[29:32] And here's some things we can do to make that up.

[29:34] And ideally, next time you say this, and that's what happened.

[29:37] Awesome.

[29:38] Right.

[29:39] And so it's not a attack.

[29:40] It's a statement of fact.

[29:42] It's an observation of reality.

[29:44] And so being able to explain that, be like, you are responsible for sales.

[29:49] We have no sales.

[29:51] This gap is the problem that we have right now.

[29:54] Now, if we did not want to grow this company,

[29:57] then we both were aligned with that, then we would have an problem.

[29:59] But I do want to grow this company.

[30:01] You are not currently doing the activities that would grow this company.

[30:04] So what do we do?

[30:06] Either you change what you do, or I stop being here.

[30:10] Just being really real.

[30:12] So you presented with a sales problem,

[30:15] but I think you have a hard conversation with the co-founder

[30:17] to have being really honest.

[30:19] We have the conversation.

[30:21] So we actually have been with the partnership.

[30:25] You have a what, sorry?

[30:26] We started a new partnership.

[30:28] You started a new partnership.

[30:29] No, no, no, no.

[30:30] The partnership with a hosting provider company,

[30:33] so they're actually bringing more companies to,

[30:35] so we're doing development agencies like,

[30:38] so they're not like the competitors,

[30:39] but we kind of went back to, because we were just to work together.

[30:42] So that actually brings in some albums.

[30:44] So now we're getting that, but he's looking,

[30:47] yeah, so I'll probably have another conversation.

[30:50] Yeah, actually, you're going to go back to, like, have the conversation,

[30:53] and then I promise you if you really, really have it,

[30:55] and the thing is, don't pull the punches.

[30:57] If you're going to have the conversation,

[30:58] be like, this is what I want.

[30:59] You're not doing that.

[31:01] And that's my fault too, because I probably have been clear about it.

[31:04] But let me be clear now.

[31:06] Yeah.

[31:07] Like, and if you don't want to do that,

[31:09] fine, let's figure out a way that we can just work on separate things,

[31:12] because I want to keep growing.

[31:14] Cool.

[31:15] I think you do that, the sales problem is all until Alexander.

[31:19] Very interesting business.

[31:20] So tell me about it.

[31:22] What's the problem? Why are we growing?

[31:24] So it's a big cloud business.

[31:26] So it's a self-blowning and the clothing is inspired by,

[31:29] like, Jack and me steamed anewer.

[31:31] So I just started out at a,

[31:33] like, creative business.

[31:34] I had a big vision for it.

[31:35] Like, I wanted to be something more than just a clothing brand.

[31:38] So what I realized is, like, a lot of people who shot,

[31:41] will be shot with us, who had similar interests.

[31:43] So I wanted to create a community around that.

[31:46] So I started, you know, creating a dis-work community.

[31:49] And now we have over 14,000 numbers.

[31:51] And those people, you know, they're kind of the fans of the brand.

[31:54] And the bill shares similar interests.

[31:57] And they're actually one of our events,

[31:58] talking very fast rumors, like, we were through large part of that.

[32:01] Yeah.

[32:02] Yeah.

[32:03] And so you go to community and about stuff that they're all interested in.

[32:06] So they're separated to that.

[32:07] Yeah, exactly.

[32:08] And so, what we, what I also want to do is I want to create,

[32:11] because they're all kind of defense or Japanese coach,

[32:13] I want to create something I read as well.

[32:16] So, for example, we created a NASPA.

[32:19] And we started putting it on packaging, like, in the pop-in-the-art orders.

[32:23] And it started learning more to, oh, the quiz this character.

[32:26] Yeah. And my goal was sort of like,

[32:28] I want to like, expand her and create a whole universe around her.

[32:32] And I create, eventually, create our own animate and in it as well.

[32:37] What's the problem?

[32:38] The problem is I'm trying to figure out what I should put my resources to.

[32:43] What I should focus on scaling the clothing and maximizing that.

[32:47] That's what's bringing in the revenue or focusing on this sort of,

[32:51] like, universe building and creating our own characters to later on,

[32:54] you know, create value in other ways, which we'll tie it up to that clothing.

[32:59] And maybe later on, I was thinking, like, creating an NFT project around, like,

[33:04] the audience, because they all have the similar interests, right?

[33:07] Yeah. And so I just don't know, like, would you want to focus on?

[33:11] So one is, like, you have the economic engine in the business, which is use all clothing with a logo on it.

[33:17] I'm just breaking everything down to, like, absolute basics, right?

[33:20] So you need to keep doing that to be able to pay for the bills to do all the rest of this stuff.

[33:25] Now, everything you've described with the universe as far as I'm concerned,

[33:28] in the micro is going to be basically media.

[33:31] It's content basically around this character that allows you to charge a premium

[33:36] and attract more people to the brand, right?

[33:39] And so I don't think you need to do either or.

[33:42] I just need, you need to think about that as marketing spend.

[33:45] And then you need to make sure that you, you can, you cap it based on return on investment.

[33:51] And provided your goal is to make money.

[33:55] Where?

[33:56] I mean, that's super genuinely.

[33:58] Now, the alternative of this is, like, I want to go build Disney and have his own characters,

[34:03] but like, it requires a ton of capital in order to do that.

[34:08] So in my opinion, what you have been doing has been working really well.

[34:12] And so I would take, if you want, to like, reinvest capital,

[34:16] take the profit from there and reinvest more than that into building out more cool media for the character that you want

[34:24] to build in the lifestyle that you want to represent for your audience.

[34:27] Yeah, because I know that like down the line, it's, this is going to be like,

[34:31] you know, what's going to create like, generational wealth.

[34:34] I know that's what I want to do.

[34:36] Yeah, this original IP, but right now the result return on investment for it.

[34:41] I can't see it, right?

[34:42] Just like I'm putting the climate money into it, but it's going to take on like,

[34:46] Well, that's kind of like a lot of times branding works that way.

[34:49] Like if I may content for three years and ask for nothing from people,

[34:53] yeah, my brand is going to be worth something.

[34:55] And it is already, and I'm like still really early into it.

[34:59] So, but I was able to do that because I had money.

[35:04] I could not have done that if I, I mean, I could have done it.

[35:07] I would have just had to work a lot harder, you know, I could not have done other things, etc.

[35:10] So you have an economic engine, which will fund this thing.

[35:14] The thing is is that like, you will get a return because if you, if,

[35:19] if this works the way you want it to work, it should grow.

[35:24] So if you just pour money into it and more people don't find out about your stuff,

[35:28] which doesn't then create more people buying, then it's not working.

[35:33] So I think I love the vibe because I look to your stuff, like it's cool.

[35:37] So like, I think more of that is a good thing.

[35:41] And I think that would create more people who are rigging fans in your audience.

[35:45] But the thing that like, I get, the good thing is that you're a missionary and I'm mercenary.

[35:50] Like you want to make this thing real, and it's awesome. It's cool.

[35:53] I want to make sure that actually happens in the real world and not just in your head.

[35:57] And so like there has to be money attached to it somewhere,

[35:59] or you need somebody who really believes in it a ton, and we'll take their money and just risk it for you.

[36:04] It's either that either you're going to risk your own money or someone else is going to risk it.

[36:07] But it's going to cost money in time to build this.

[36:09] And so the nice thing is what you want to do is have a symbiotic relation between the character and the media that you're building

[36:16] in the way that you've monetized.

[36:17] And this is also what you're going to want to do anyways, because if the audience that you build that loves this character

[36:22] and stuff doesn't want to ever buy stuff from you, then you're not blood in the right behaviors anyways.

[36:26] For it to achieve scale, Mickey Mouse has to sell her shirts, hats, t-shirts, movies.

[36:30] Right? So that's, I would also study the hell out of Walt Disney.

[36:35] Yeah, I, I, I've looked into it.

[36:37] Okay, yeah, I would read everything that's ever been written on.

[36:40] And look at like new age stuff, look at what Gary's doing with the, the friends.

[36:45] He has a whole universe around the different characters. Same concept, but there's commerce there.

[36:50] He's got cards, he's got, you know, shirts, he's got merch, he's got all these other things.

[36:54] Two build up the characters.

[36:57] Yeah, I'm doing a lot of research include NFT projects, because like they're able to provide value through storytelling and making value creating value.

[37:06] I have nothing pretty much head to just, just never say those words again.

[37:11] Sorry.

[37:12] I would just never say those words again.

[37:14] No, no value out of nothing now.

[37:17] Yeah, especially tied to NFTs.

[37:21] Yeah, does that make sense? That's what I felt because so to answer your question, yes, I would invest the cash that I have as much as you believe, because it's a, it's a bet.

[37:30] It's as much as you believe in this, but I would make sure that people are still being more attracted to your brand and buy more stuff.

[37:38] Yeah, you bet.

[37:43] How's it going?

[37:44] Rockin', what's that drink?

[37:46] I don't even know where to start.

[37:49] It's just one question I'll try and answer that one.

[37:53] When you were in the process of pivoting with the model for Jim launch, and you were trying to just like,

[38:03] hit money together to even make it to the next thing.

[38:07] That's exactly.

[38:08] Sweet.

[38:10] Like, I have read, read and watched and research.

[38:14] Like, everything you've ever done regarding that, because it's just I feel it balls to point out because I mean,

[38:22] we need to do right now.

[38:27] I need to have people so that it is not solely me.

[38:31] What is that? What do you sell?

[38:33] I'd say paid advertising agency for or canoes.

[38:36] For cannabis?

[38:38] Got it.

[38:39] Tough.

[38:40] Yeah.

[38:41] But on the flip side of it being tough, bits wide.

[38:45] There's so much leverage with that.

[38:47] Cool.

[38:48] There's a, huh?

[38:50] So it's the issue.

[38:51] What's the problem?

[38:52] Uh, meat.

[38:54] Oh, yeah, sure.

[38:55] It's always you.

[38:56] But like, what's the business problem?

[38:58] Like, is it not make you like, I need to make all this money?

[39:00] Like, are you not profitable or are you like, is it profitable?

[39:03] However, it's just not went on long enough for the profit to just exist, you know,

[39:08] lump some enough to be able to, like, pay for people because I've been,

[39:12] I actually don't know what that means.

[39:14] I've been actively doing this for like four months.

[39:17] So it's like, I've brought money in.

[39:20] Okay.

[39:21] But I've never had payroll.

[39:24] Never done any of that.

[39:25] I've never hired anybody.

[39:27] It's all those soft skills and just have it and working through the anxiety of getting to that first higher.

[39:32] What's revenue right now?

[39:35] Reduce 600, okay?

[39:37] Okay.

[39:38] Okay, got it.

[39:40] Um, however, okay.

[39:44] That is the literal metric, but I collect ad spend for a gun.

[39:49] So actual profit would be like 90, 90, on her career.

[39:53] Okay.

[39:54] Yeah. So, okay.

[39:55] So this all, so you got to sit in this room and have some different

[40:00] conversations that I'm going to be super direct with you.

[40:03] You don't need to worry about anything you just said.

[40:06] Like, you have 90K a year that you have to work with.

[40:09] You have no room to hire people.

[40:11] You either need to fix your model.

[40:13] Because if I'm guessing you're working all the hours of the day to make the 90K.

[40:17] Yeah.

[40:18] Right.

[40:19] Which means the models are okay.

[40:20] So you can't hire more people because you basically use the most valuable play in the business.

[40:25] Like the founder is always going to be the most valuable person of business,

[40:28] especially day one when there's no one else.

[40:30] So you need to get to a point where you should be able to make way more than what you need

[40:36] so that you have room to hire other people who can help you.

[40:39] And so right now, you don't have a people problem.

[40:42] It would be a model problem.

[40:43] Which means the way that you're charging or billing the cannabis people,

[40:46] you're either offering too much to them.

[40:48] Well, it's really, you're just like you're offering too much for too little.

[40:50] Fundamentally, that's what it is.

[40:51] Because either you need to be working way less to be making the money you are

[40:55] and you like shoot, I could take 10 times the customer's icing or customers.

[40:58] Or you should be charging way way more for where you're at and be like,

[41:03] okay, well, I'm making 10 times more than I am right now.

[41:05] And now I can go for people.

[41:08] That's it.

[41:09] So either you need to work on how you do delivery to make it 10 times more efficient.

[41:13] Or make it so that how much you make 10 times more per customer.

[41:18] Who are you doing?

[41:20] It's by about a factor of 10.

[41:22] Like, I think if you came in, you're like, we're doing my 900,000 year.

[41:25] And it's just me.

[41:26] I'd be like, okay, cool.

[41:27] Let's start our own people.

[41:28] That makes sense.

[41:29] Hmm?

[41:30] I get it.

[41:31] I did know that the question was.

[41:34] No, no, no, no.

[41:36] Dude, you're good.

[41:37] You're good.

[41:38] I'm trying to help you where you're at.

[41:39] You go to them saying, though, forget about that.

[41:42] Do you go to them saying?

[41:43] Yes.

[41:44] So you need their 10x the price that you're charging for you're currently doing.

[41:46] Or make how you deliver what you're doing, 10 times more efficient.

[41:49] I'm just going to do that set.

[41:51] Otherwise, the model was not going to work.

[41:53] So trying to scale what you're currently doing is a better idea.

[41:55] You need to fix what you're currently doing.

[41:57] So that you can scale it.

[41:58] Okay.

[41:59] Cool.

[42:00] Drist question.

[42:01] There's a big good guy named Kyle Mouth.

[42:04] Kyle Mouth.

[42:05] He does a lot of five businesses.

[42:07] I'll get a presentation here, though.

[42:10] Anyways, just a quick background.

[42:12] So I own four auto body shops.

[42:14] Like, then I pivoted into garage doors.

[42:16] That's right.

[42:17] And there's a, there's a hailstone, which I love.

[42:20] We think.

[42:21] Yeah.

[42:22] Yeah.

[42:23] And I'm right.

[42:24] I pivoted to garage doors because it's just initially kind of

[42:28] Private, private, private out there.

[42:30] There's only maybe two big players that are out in there.

[42:33] They're not that many.

[42:34] Go.

[42:35] And so we started professionalizing the company.

[42:36] I've been installing SOT's checklist.

[42:38] Orange process.

[42:39] Yeah, training.

[42:40] They'll give it to you.

[42:41] Fangio's really good.

[42:42] But my one issue is, we have a weird niche.

[42:45] Affirmable.

[42:46] Which we're trying to diversify.

[42:48] We're going to be a way from where we kind of have a single child risk.

[42:51] We pretty much give most of our lead training home.

[42:53] Lawrence, he's other eight of them.

[42:55] So it's not like one, you know, two-ale, but I don't like.

[42:59] Yeah, he's work like guy, though.

[43:00] And we would get a body shop.

[43:02] And we'd become 30% 40.

[43:04] 50.

[43:05] 70% and we own.

[43:06] I don't want that.

[43:07] I want just like I'm by our organic customers coming in.

[43:11] Pade leads.

[43:12] Yeah, all these things.

[43:13] And so where I'm at is like at this pivot point.

[43:15] Why?

[43:16] I'm going to start.

[43:17] Why do we do seven or even seven million?

[43:18] Seven million.

[43:19] Okay.

[43:20] Yeah.

[43:21] One point five million attached flow.

[43:22] And but it does have far enough in the debt.

[43:24] It like purchased.

[43:25] You know, I've got.

[43:26] I've anyways.

[43:27] The cool thing is it's doing no marketing right now at all.

[43:30] We have one lead every fund from marketing.

[43:33] We're going to solve more about this start this whole SEO, PPC, maybe play a

[43:37] Spokin, etc.

[43:38] So my one question is, you know, I got a organized hot.

[43:43] And how should I organize it?

[43:45] Should I get a marketing manager or where say, get them from.

[43:48] So I hired them to kind of supervise build out a teach me.

[43:51] So if I can know, because it all.

[43:53] Integrated that apart to the business, you know, and it's just how do I tell

[43:57] Would you organize it if you're on my state.

[43:59] I basically get a build it from a ground up, which is technical.

[44:01] Yeah.

[44:02] Yeah.

[44:03] I'm trying to think because it's kind of the issue that I don't have with.

[44:06] Like when it's a core function of the business, like I see.

[44:08] I see drain making as a big part of business.

[44:10] Like customer act, the customer act is usually got delivery as the two.

[44:13] And then you got ops is the third leg of the stool.

[44:15] Like every business needs all three.

[44:16] So I'm going to get customers and deliver customers and someone to make sure they know

[44:19] And it's the jail.

[44:20] And like make sure all three have to like keep going around.

[44:22] Right.

[44:23] And by that one, I mean, talks to people.

[44:24] HR, finance, legal, all that stuff.

[44:27] Right.

[44:28] Okay.

[44:29] So it's a core function of the, I mean, like generally,

[44:32] I like the fact that the fact that you have the eight, the eight different places

[44:35] that you're getting the, the warranty leads from.

[44:37] So that's kind of sweet.

[44:38] I mean, I would just continue to do that as much as I could get, you know,

[44:42] go from eight to 20 or whatever.

[44:44] I don't even know how many, you probably know the number saturated.

[44:47] Yeah, right.

[44:48] Yeah, we got them.

[44:49] There's a lot of them.

[44:50] We said like, oh, you're a biggest vendor along the Pomp and Deep all my family.

[44:53] I'm a wild event.

[44:55] Yeah.

[44:56] I would, I would probably, if I'm trying to think about where I start.

[44:59] Me personally,

[45:00] PPCs is,

[45:02] will be harder to crack initially,

[45:05] but then once you have it's very stable.

[45:08] And so for local PPC,

[45:10] I think, will work really well.

[45:12] It's a totally different monster,

[45:14] but then social media ads like meta,

[45:16] specifically, I think will work really really well.

[45:19] The thing with meta ads for local is,

[45:22] I'd want to have someone in house for that.

[45:25] The PPC guys,

[45:27] there's a bunch of really good agencies for PPC that can do pretty good work for you on the local level.

[45:33] Who can just probably handle it pretty well.

[45:35] But the social media side,

[45:37] I have yet to see people who don't do huge companies,

[45:40] do a good job,

[45:41] and that's just because you have to have so much creative.

[45:45] Like, create a good tired and local market like two or three weeks.

[45:48] So you have to make creative every 21 days,

[45:51] like, and like a decent amount of it.

[45:54] I mean, this is why we had gym lunch.

[45:55] Like, we just, we took all the creative burden over,

[45:58] but we did it for a thousand locations.

[46:00] So you'd have to build that in house.

[46:02] So in terms of like, ease and speed,

[46:04] I would probably go vendor first for the PPC.

[46:08] This is me just saying what would I do.

[46:10] Yeah, I would probably go vendor first for PPC,

[46:13] and then I would probably,

[46:16] I'd try and bring someone in house who,

[46:19] and probably a younger guy who understands paid ads at a local level.

[46:24] And the nice thing is that there's a gazillion of them.

[46:26] Guys who understand local ads on social media.

[46:30] And, and give him some sort of exciting, like,

[46:33] a little mini-comp that you can earn into.

[46:35] And, because if he's relatively tech savvy and as head of do social media,

[46:41] I didn't want not.

[46:42] You could become a weapon for the business.

[46:44] And that could probably really help you on the acquisition side,

[46:47] because you'll just like, scoop him up, put whatever 100 grand 200 grand

[46:51] and whatever you buy before, level the rest,

[46:53] and then you could like immediately triple the business and roll it in.

[46:56] Yeah, just some kind of talk about this.

[46:58] You know, Porsche, I know that too.

[46:59] We're doing a rebrand too.

[47:00] It's one of the trucks for app, the certain way,

[47:02] but yeah, company and all that.

[47:03] Well, the SEO, would you do that same kind of go through an H&C out

[47:06] or at house?

[47:07] See, like, eat this, see, but.

[47:09] Yeah, I mean, a PPC's really simple.

[47:11] And so, I think, and they're usually pretty well-priced,

[47:14] especially for local, and when you get a good guy,

[47:16] it's like, they just run the same playbook.

[47:18] They go for the same links.

[47:19] They build the same way, and they're just kind of like it works.

[47:21] For SEO, SEO is more complicated.

[47:27] And it is very much like the skill of the, like,

[47:30] there's, I feel like there's more skill in my opinion,

[47:33] for SEO than there is for PPC.

[47:36] But the nice thing is that locals easy to win,

[47:39] compared to, like, national.

[47:41] And so, it's just trying to win local markets.

[47:43] Again, I just whenever I do anything in a new thing,

[47:46] I start with vendors.

[47:47] If you come through the agency, you jep her in the Lates book.

[47:50] It does not have a bot.

[47:52] And I'm like, just showed up on the website.

[47:54] But just literally read that chapter.

[47:55] Just read that chapter.

[47:56] Yeah, it just gives you my playbook for a hard crack

[48:00] every new channel.

[48:01] It's like, what I do.

[48:02] I buy the agency, and then I tell them I'm going to take

[48:06] over in six months.

[48:07] You help me train the person, and then eventually I won't

[48:10] need you.

[48:11] Yeah, I was actually where I bought the book,

[48:14] and I came because I was like, when I think of,

[48:16] you will like, I think of marketing and sales and conversions.

[48:20] And if you're an offered jet, I'm not.

[48:22] But I'm just out and, yeah, I'm just out.

[48:24] Yeah, yeah, yeah, you could literally both,

[48:29] and like, there's one, three hours the other's like,

[48:31] four and a half.

[48:32] So you should be good.

[48:33] All right, Adam, TNT.

[48:35] So, maybe I'd say you see cool.

[48:37] Uh, Google or better.

[48:39] Oh, okay, totally different monsters.

[48:42] Yeah, but I like called your experience.

[48:45] So I'm an ideal and I saw how important that

[48:48] I was.

[48:49] You saw it different.

[48:50] That's a great.

[48:51] Yeah.

[48:52] Um, mind biggest issues are, as you well,

[48:55] that's what been mind-sealed.

[48:57] We've been.

[48:58] All right.

[48:59] And then.

[49:00] Who do you sell to?

[49:01] Primarily company spending over 100k.

[49:03] And that's.

[49:04] Commenter for you.

[49:05] For a month.

[49:06] Okay, for a month.

[49:07] Got it.

[49:08] Okay.

[49:09] Um, and then on top of that,

[49:10] like, where you talked about what other people

[49:12] talk about is monetary face agency and higher health.

[49:16] Okay.

[49:17] Which current self do you need short?

[49:19] It was a plan for a.

[49:21] So it's my plan.

[49:22] No, I said unless you plan for it.

[49:24] Yeah.

[49:25] And just pick it into how you do things.

[49:27] So other might say problems.

[49:29] Okay, so the, I mean, the, the them trying to bring it in house.

[49:33] I would bring it up front.

[49:35] And I would have you read that chapter in the book.

[49:38] Okay.

[49:39] Good.

[49:41] So, so I would say like cool.

[49:43] So what I'm going to do is this is the first part.

[49:45] And then whenever you want to start bringing this in house,

[49:47] we'll switch from this to consulting and we'll

[49:49] convince the transition period and we'll stay on a consulting basis.

[49:52] Until you, your team is outperforming what we were doing.

[49:56] Now, if the team never outperforms what you do,

[49:58] then you stand a consulting basis forever.

[49:59] But it's still the nature of the relationships fund.

[50:01] Because like being a service provider versus being an

[50:04] consultant, totally different vibe.

[50:05] I'm sure you've done before.

[50:07] Um, and so it actually goes from like steps.

[50:09] Or V into you being a teacher, which is actually kind of fun.

[50:11] And so that'll stand LTV aligns your interest.

[50:13] So that's good.

[50:14] Was the other problem?

[50:16] So for the, how do you price the things all clear to you?

[50:20] By done for you?

[50:22] Um,

[50:24] which your current done for you, president?

[50:27] I think we can present in the year.

[50:29] Right.

[50:30] Um,

[50:32] it's a good question.

[50:42] I mean, honestly, I just, uh,

[50:46] I probably end up just saying like,

[50:50] I'll either add in the consulting.

[50:53] Is either I mean, I'll either add it in to what we're currently doing.

[50:56] Because they're going to need the,

[50:58] the service from you while they're getting the consulting.

[51:01] And then basically, so the question is after the consulting,

[51:04] after the delivery periods over,

[51:06] what's the consulting fee for after the fact?

[51:09] Yeah, that one.

[51:10] I mean, I'd probably look at something like,

[51:13] I don't know, 30% just as starting point.

[51:16] Where are you?

[51:18] For some of what you were doing.

[51:19] So probably like 3% of ads fund.

[51:21] And so then you can just be like,

[51:23] listen, the questions can I get your got to be, you know,

[51:25] this much more efficient.

[51:26] If you think the arguments there, great.

[51:27] If not, no worries.

[51:28] So probably 20% of how it would be.

[51:30] Okay.

[51:31] And then the second part is SQO for my done in GBS,

[51:35] which is over the under 10.

[51:38] I just see a,

[51:40] any time I take over that's over under 10% across it in my few weeks.

[51:44] Under 10% a lot harder.

[51:47] So I want more SQO that way.

[51:52] Right now my entire pipeline is through the bucket.

[51:55] Okay.

[51:56] And just regrow partners and coppers.

[51:58] Yeah, you just need to go get what you want.

[52:01] So it's got to be outbound.

[52:03] So you need to go outbound in terms of like high value targets.

[52:06] So like cold call, go DM, whatever.

[52:09] One, two, you can make content very niche in terms of what you're talking about.

[52:13] That'll still get everyone,

[52:15] but you'll also get the good people.

[52:17] Or you just use your own expertise of running ads and target those people.

[52:21] So if I had to do these in order,

[52:23] I would probably start with ads because that's your bread and butter.

[52:25] And I would actually just start a campaign that specifically for those people and calls them out in every single way you can.

[52:30] Like targets that way within the messaging has to be just super harsh.

[52:33] Like if you're not spending 100 or 100 more, please just scroll past this ad.

[52:37] Like dumbest one, pick slow.

[52:39] And probably like thing.

[52:41] Yeah, I think LinkedIn has a lot of really good quality people.

[52:44] Yeah.

[52:46] Well, homed.

[52:48] Yes.

[52:49] All right.

[52:50] Well, thanks for the opportunity that.

[52:53] A little bit back around about me.

[52:55] I'm a dentist.

[52:56] I want my prime just for 15 years.

[52:59] And I focus on dental implants.

[53:02] And the primary patient inflow method has been Google ads for the past eight years.

[53:13] I'd say about half of my patients come from internal referrals for friends and family and then the other half come from Google ads.

[53:20] That company that I've been with for eight years has had the same landing page for eight years.

[53:25] And has not gotten any feedback from us about lead quality or anything.

[53:30] And past year, I would say, don't you wish you had him as a customer?

[53:34] I like I love this guy.

[53:36] That's easy.

[53:38] The quality has gone down.

[53:40] You know, it's just all down to shit.

[53:41] So last year, I decided, you know, this is a really important part of my business.

[53:45] I want to just take ownership of this.

[53:47] So I partnered up with these people, who I was introduced to say, hey, you cracked the Google ads algorithm.

[53:53] I'm going to work on the coaching and lead nurturing and value buildings aspect of it.

[54:00] So we, and that didn't work out.

[54:02] This company didn't know what they were doing.

[54:04] So it all makes it.

[54:05] So anyways, now I'm working with another company trying to build the funnel, the landing page and whatnot.

[54:12] Have not made any content, but I have all the set up to start doing that.

[54:17] So I wanted to build content specifically for the funnel.

[54:22] So when people click on the ad, they have a video of me and, you know, social profile that kind of stuff.

[54:27] But I also want to build or create content just for general, like social presence and also value building.

[54:36] So should I focus primarily on the Google ads first and lean on that?

[54:41] And then start working on the general content.

[54:44] Second question to have for you is I've been doing what you had said that everyone does, which is survey the market for what the price is.

[54:53] Charge a little bit less and offer a ton more value.

[54:57] So the ton more value that I'm offering is a lot of additional procedures that go along with the service that I'm providing.

[55:03] That's how create predictability and long term.

[55:07] And I want to lean in on that it is a differentiating factor because a lot of the competition is newer newer chains newer doctors.

[55:14] They don't have the track history and I have a lot of patients that I've treated 10, 12, 15 years ago that I want to sort of highlight.

[55:22] And so in that regard, should I continue charging or advertising the price that I am advertising and just highlight the more value that I'm getting to get more.

[55:32] More revenue coming in first and then try to raise my price or you know, love feedback on how to position myself in this new funnel of this new experience.

[55:42] I'm doing it would be just raise your price.

[55:45] Okay.

[55:46] I mean, I've told my father this for the entirety of my life and he is still never listening to me.

[55:52] So, you know, maybe maybe it'll work for you. He's like, I booked out for nine years and I'm like, yeah, what if you just doubled your price?

[55:59] You could work the same amount you currently do every day and just make twice as much money.

[56:03] And so unless you have a demand issue or a conversion issue right now, like when you get people into they do not buy.

[56:10] So I don't really have a sales process, a sales system and so I'll just mean.

[56:15] You do have a sales process, you just haven't documented it.

[56:17] But I just, you know, I just talked them like them knowing this is what your situation is, is high.

[56:22] I've said to you if I recorded you and I played 50 of those side by side, second by second. You'd be like, oh, this is the part where I make the same amount of jokes about this thing.

[56:31] And then I asked them why they're here and then I say, what if you thought about before, why now, why why is this help you out? Okay, got it.

[56:39] Okay, has there been anything else? No, why may to tell you about this thing? I think it might be a good fit. Here's what you can expect. Great.

[56:45] It's even your questions for me. Bob of law.

[56:47] And so you probably do have a process. You just don't write it down.

[56:51] Now after reading your books and listening everything now we're working on creating a system and then educating the team on it so they can carry the baton.

[57:00] So that's where I am and you know, raising the price.

[57:06] I certainly can justify it because I guess I have.

[57:10] Well, I was to do it even if you couldn't justify it.

[57:13] Just raise it anyways. Because you felt like it's Tuesday because who cares? You raise it because you want to. It's America and you can choose to charge what you want and they can choose to say no and you can choose to say this is all of it. What I think, what I, what I charge.

[57:26] And so like, it's like, just in terms of the idea of like I have to do this because to do this, it's like you can just do it.

[57:35] You know, you're a company a year ago and I mean, I tell the story because I like breaking the belief and so we bought it. We did this massive analysis and I was just like, I had the whole leadership team and they're like, so what's the big. How are we going to like grow the hell out of this company? I was like,

[57:50] I think I'm just going to double the price and they're like, what else are going to go? I think I said, I think it's all I'm going to do.

[57:56] And they're like, but what about all these things? I was like, I don't think that's, I think we're just going to do that.

[58:02] And so we did that and the sales team was like, so what do we need to retrain the sales team? I was like, you're going to say the same thing.

[58:08] And then they're very in when you say the price, I was like instead of saying this number, you say this number, that's it.

[58:14] And then we did that and it took me nine calls to the founder nine and he didn't agree.

[58:21] And so we settled on 50% increase. So we increased the price by 50%. And close rates went up.

[58:29] Because there was misprice. And so we sold a higher percentage people at 50% more money. And if you do more times more, it's way more because all that goes to bottom line.

[58:38] And so that's a beautiful thing with price increases is that it's all profit.

[58:43] One of my favorite ways to make one probably just charge more. So TLDR, yes, I think you should charge more and in terms of the ad stuff.

[58:54] You're either going to have to learn this yourself, which feels unlikely. Or you're going to have to keep doing this trial and earth.

[59:00] Well, I am learning it myself. I actually have started the courses and gotten into Google ads and Facebook ads.

[59:07] It's again, it's not something I'm going to do myself. But I can't delegate until I have full in-depth knowledge. It's just kind of how I built the rest of the business.

[59:15] I like it. We have the lab side also on site. So it's vertically integrated. We just need to just prank that engine of what.

[59:23] Once you get that going, the ultimate version of the business is that you start buying other practices.

[59:28] Because then you can install your systems on top, your reputation, etc. And that's when it gets a lot more interesting.

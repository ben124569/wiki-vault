[00:00] In this video, I'm gonna show you how to turn $1,000 into $45,000

[00:04] through the milk.

[00:05] And over the last 90 days, we spent just under 10 million emails

[00:10] from acquisition.com, and we generate tens of millions

[00:12] of dollars across the portfolio using email itself.

[00:14] And in this video, I'm gonna break down emails that I've sent

[00:17] and I'll give you the 10 tactics that have worked very well

[00:20] for us so far.

[00:21] First things first, here's why I think you should do email.

[00:23] I was more on and decided to not email

[00:27] for the vast majority of my life,

[00:28] because I hate money, apparently.

[00:30] And so the average ROI for email,

[00:33] depending on the source you look at,

[00:34] is between 35 and 45 return.

[00:37] So that means that for every dollar you spend on software

[00:39] or putting time into your email,

[00:41] you can get like $45 back.

[00:43] Like a matchup, there was a stock investment

[00:45] that you could 50 acts in a week.

[00:49] Well, that's kind of like what email is,

[00:51] and people still don't do it.

[00:52] My self included.

[00:53] And part of the reason that making money on email

[00:55] is more profitable is because you actually

[00:57] already spent the time to acquire this contact.

[00:59] And so in a lot of ways, emails just follow up.

[01:01] And so you spent the cost of the cards of lead,

[01:03] now you're just reminding them that you exist.

[01:05] And so basically the only real cost is just whatever

[01:08] software you use and whoever or whomever you may have

[01:11] to pay in order to write the emails.

[01:13] That's pretty much it.

[01:14] And so one email writer can send an email

[01:16] to 10 million people, and that is a tremendous amount

[01:19] of leverage that you get in your business

[01:22] that a lot of people ignore.

[01:23] On top of that, email is one of the most consumed media

[01:26] platforms, and it hasn't died down.

[01:28] So 61% of people check their email multiple times per day.

[01:32] 20% of people check it multiple times per hour.

[01:35] It has almost the same consumption rate as social media

[01:37] in terms of how engaged some of the users are

[01:40] of people reading their emails every single day.

[01:42] And what's cool about email is that it's actually

[01:45] uniform across age groups.

[01:46] And so you can see between 15 to 24, 25 to 44, 45 to 64,

[01:51] and 65 plus pretty much everyone, 90% plus or 84

[01:54] at the very end bracket there, reading email all the time.

[01:57] If you're going to master something,

[01:58] it's one that transcends age groups.

[02:00] And I'll bet you, even though we don't have the metric,

[02:03] it transcends countries as well.

[02:04] I would bet you that UK people probably

[02:06] respond similar to US people, probably even respond

[02:09] to Chinese people in terms of their email consumption.

[02:12] And I know just because I've gone back and forth

[02:14] with Chinese providers and warehouses and things like that,

[02:17] they're pretty responsive on email too.

[02:18] And so a massive, very invisible platform.

[02:21] And so as I think about email,

[02:23] the objective of the email has one of two purposes.

[02:26] One is to increase the likelihood that this person

[02:29] purchases in the future or that they purchase.

[02:32] That's fundamentally it.

[02:33] And so basically has the exact same objectives as content.

[02:37] And so it's just a different form of content consumption,

[02:39] except where you can guarantee that you get delivery

[02:42] whereas when you make a post, the algorithm decides

[02:45] who gets to see it, when you send an email,

[02:48] basically your past performance determines

[02:50] whether or not they get to see it.

[02:52] And there's a couple of little tricks

[02:53] to make sure you get in the right email,

[02:54] inbox and not get in the promo tabs.

[02:56] We'll go over some of that stuff.

[02:56] But big picture, you actually have the list

[02:58] and you send it directly to them.

[03:00] And if you're embarrassed by the way that you haven't sent

[03:03] email, then worry not because I am too.

[03:06] And I will show you the first email

[03:07] I'll set to my list just not that many months ago.

[03:09] That's obviously within acquisition.

[03:11] Not called the portfolio company, send emails all the time.

[03:12] But I hadn't sent anything to imagination.

[03:14] And so this was it.

[03:16] So I started with subject is this on.

[03:18] And I just said that because I thought it was funny.

[03:20] I started with a quote that I like a lot,

[03:22] which is it only takes 20 hours of folks

[03:24] effort to get proficient in a skill.

[03:25] The problem is most people waste years

[03:27] before they start the first hour.

[03:28] So I've been making content for four or five years now.

[03:30] And I had yet to send an email.

[03:32] And so that quote of mine felt rather appropriate for myself.

[03:37] The thing is, is that I think you can model something

[03:38] like this, like if it has been a minute for you,

[03:40] like I should have been emailing.

[03:42] It's okay.

[03:42] You can start whenever you want.

[03:43] And the day you start is the day you start getting

[03:45] 45 plus returns on the time and money put into it.

[03:49] So I said after 13 years of business,

[03:50] I'm finally going to write you.

[03:51] I know why I'm the fact that it's taking me this long

[03:53] is doubly stupid considering people think

[03:55] that I'm an author.

[03:56] And part of the reason that actually didn't send emails

[03:57] before is that I'm so selective with your attention.

[04:01] I don't want to waste it ever.

[04:02] And so I would rather not send you something at all,

[04:04] rather than send you something bad.

[04:05] That's number one.

[04:06] Number two is that I'm very picky with written word.

[04:08] And so if you ever she written word across any of my social

[04:10] channels, believe it or not, I wrote it.

[04:12] Did either came out of my mouth or I physically typed it?

[04:14] It's directly from me.

[04:15] Because for some reason, I feel like written word carries more

[04:18] than anything else does.

[04:19] And it's probably why even in like legal discourse,

[04:21] if you have written proof and contracts are legally binding,

[04:24] it's because it's written, there's something powerful

[04:25] about words.

[04:26] I basically break this whole down and say,

[04:28] hey, I'm starting, most of you many minutes,

[04:30] which is basically the name of my newsletter.

[04:32] So my whole goal was how do I provide value in under 60 seconds,

[04:36] so someone can read it and immediately get something

[04:39] that they can use in their business.

[04:40] And so my goal is that I hope I pay for myself

[04:42] with every email that I send.

[04:43] And I also include one thought that's improved my life.

[04:45] And so for here, if I were to like apply this to this,

[04:48] it'd be like, okay, this is kind of the thought

[04:50] that improved my life.

[04:50] And this one, I don't have a tactic that improves their business,

[04:54] but maybe just reminding them to send emails

[04:55] would be the first thing.

[04:56] But everyone after that, that are officially

[04:58] most of you money minutes, do.

[04:59] So let's dive into those.

[05:00] Now let's talk about different tactics.

[05:01] So first things first, everybody wants to talk about

[05:03] how much you can make from email,

[05:04] but no one talks about unsubscribing, right?

[05:06] No one wants it's like the dirty other,

[05:08] oh yeah, people want every time you send a communication

[05:10] out, there's gonna be people unsubscribing.

[05:11] And I don't see unsubscribing nearly as negatively as other people do.

[05:15] And I'll explain why.

[05:16] When I look at our people who show up to workshops,

[05:18] a lot of times they are people who unsubscribed.

[05:22] So it's not an insult, it's like they know who I am

[05:24] and they're in.

[05:26] I don't see it as a negative per se.

[05:28] Also every single day, thousands of people unsubscribed

[05:31] from my Instagram, thousands of people unsubscribed from YouTube,

[05:33] but I just have more people who subscribe.

[05:35] And so I just see the process of advertising

[05:38] and letting people know about your stuff.

[05:39] And so if someone unsubscribes,

[05:41] they absolutely know about you and your stuff.

[05:43] And it doesn't necessarily mean they don't wanna buy.

[05:45] It just might not mean that that forward communication

[05:48] or that particular inbox they opted in with

[05:50] is the one that they wanna use.

[05:51] Fine, no big deal.

[05:52] So instead of trying to hide it,

[05:54] it's like, probably like, if I see a brand,

[05:57] try and make unsubscribing hard, I hate them.

[06:00] And so I have always tried to do the opposite of that.

[06:03] I think number one is that you wanna make unsubscribing easy.

[06:05] Don't keep you captive, let me explain by that.

[06:06] Is I don't wanna keep sending emails

[06:08] to an uninterested segment of my list

[06:11] because it'll actually make my domain delivery

[06:13] to go down long-term.

[06:14] By sending it for vanity metrics of look,

[06:16] I sent more emails.

[06:18] I actually decrease the likelihood

[06:19] that they people who do wanna read my emails,

[06:21] actually get them.

[06:22] And so that's why you wanna make unsubscribing easy

[06:24] because if you make it hard,

[06:26] they might not unsubscribe but then they go dormant,

[06:28] which is actually worse for you.

[06:29] So make it easy.

[06:30] I wanna be real with you for a second.

[06:32] If you haven't sent email,

[06:33] you really don't send off,

[06:35] like once every six months or something.

[06:36] The first time you send an email,

[06:37] you're gonna have a higher unsubscribed rate than normal.

[06:39] And that's okay.

[06:40] I call it shaking the trade.

[06:42] It's basically like pulling forward churn.

[06:43] It's the same thing if you correspond

[06:45] with customers who are on a recurring revenue business.

[06:47] And you haven't been emailing them or haven't been reaching

[06:49] after them.

[06:50] You will always get more churn.

[06:50] You'll get next month churn and this month's churn.

[06:52] All at once.

[06:53] And so the highest churn I ever had was on the first email

[06:56] I ever sent.

[06:57] And so it was like just over 1% which is crazy, right?

[07:00] But now it's like 0.42 unsubscribed rate per email,

[07:03] which is fine.

[07:04] As long as we grow higher than that between emails,

[07:06] that's a good ROI.

[07:07] And it's like, you have to take the logical extrem here.

[07:10] If you are unafraid to email

[07:13] because you don't wanna get unsubscribed,

[07:14] why do you have emails to begin with?

[07:17] It's kinda like saying, well, I don't wanna post content

[07:18] because then people would stop following me.

[07:19] It's like, well, the only point of them following you

[07:21] is to advertise your stuff.

[07:23] And so if the logical extrem of this is just never do anything,

[07:27] then that's probably not the right conclusion.

[07:29] Number two, and this one is a little bit more advanced,

[07:31] but very worth it.

[07:33] So, Housebot ran a really cool research study

[07:35] where they saw that they had an increase.

[07:37] So, already in scene ROI for email,

[07:39] they had a 791% increase in ROI from email

[07:42] from one thing, which is people who segmented their lists,

[07:45] got way higher returns on email,

[07:47] which should be somewhat unsurprising.

[07:51] Like if you send the right emails to the right people,

[07:53] then they will be more likely to buy your stuff.

[07:56] So if I send a beginner email to a list of advanced people,

[07:59] they'll be like, this is not for me.

[08:01] And to the same degree,

[08:02] and also, it doesn't have anything to do with the email,

[08:03] it's not gonna be right for them.

[08:04] And to the same degree, if I send an advanced thing,

[08:06] to people who don't have a business,

[08:07] or want to start a business,

[08:08] then they're gonna be like, this doesn't apply.

[08:10] And so, it's way less about how good the email is,

[08:13] and so much more about who's getting it.

[08:14] And so segmenting the list is basically like,

[08:16] if you have any qualifiers on your opt-in,

[08:18] so like revenue, or if they have a business,

[08:20] or don't have a business,

[08:21] which are some of the ones that we have in our opt-in process,

[08:24] this allows us to send content that's more applicable

[08:26] to those people.

[08:27] And so when we have our list, we say,

[08:28] oh, let's just send this to the 500K plus,

[08:30] let's just send this to the 5 million plus,

[08:32] let's just send this to zero to 100K.

[08:34] And so, a lot of people would have lied,

[08:36] because they think they're gonna get like a better experience

[08:38] if they go up, but like,

[08:38] you're just gonna get stuff that doesn't apply to you.

[08:40] So, just be honest when you're putting your info in.

[08:42] So, let me pull up a sample email,

[08:43] so we can break down the structure,

[08:45] so you can think about it.

[08:46] Now, to be clear, you don't have to do this.

[08:48] I'm just gonna explain what I was doing,

[08:50] and if it's useful for you, great.

[08:51] Number one, on the subject heading,

[08:53] I thought a lot about this,

[08:54] because on some end, there's a lot of internet marketers

[08:56] and digital guys who, you know,

[08:58] they split us the hell out of their subjects.

[09:00] And I thought about this more as like a podcast,

[09:03] where it's like podcast episode X,

[09:05] and then it just keeps going,

[09:06] because my thought I'll explain was,

[09:08] if I can basically develop the brand

[09:10] of Mozi Money Minute to be very strong,

[09:12] then eventually we'll get to the point

[09:14] where independent of what I have

[09:15] after Mozi Money Minute,

[09:16] when people know that they always get value

[09:18] in the past when they read it,

[09:19] they'll just click.

[09:20] Going back and forth on this,

[09:21] I was like, I wanna build the brand of my email

[09:24] to be strong.

[09:25] And so, on one hand, you could say,

[09:26] well, they know it's from you,

[09:27] then that could be the brand,

[09:28] but we send other emails as well,

[09:30] that are not Mozi Money Minute.

[09:32] So, I wanted Mozi Money Minute to have it

[09:33] so in kind of like, little space in someone's mind.

[09:36] That was a choice, I made.

[09:37] You could obviously just have your subject

[09:38] be proof of a promise, that's your call,

[09:40] but that's why I decided to stick with it,

[09:41] and that's what I've done.

[09:42] So, right off the bat,

[09:43] I think about everything in terms of

[09:45] feedback cycles in a reward.

[09:46] And so, I wanna reward every action that someone's takes.

[09:48] And so, if someone first reads the email,

[09:50] then if they've been rewarded in the past for a month,

[09:52] they'll click in the open it.

[09:53] Now, I need to reward them for that.

[09:55] So, a lot of people think about behavior as,

[09:56] what happened before, that triggered someone

[09:59] to do something,

[10:00] but that's actually not how behavior works

[10:01] and that's been proven.

[10:02] The way behavior works is that you did that thing

[10:04] because you did it another time in the past

[10:07] and then rewarded for it.

[10:08] So, if you wanna see why someone does something,

[10:10] look at what happens after they do it.

[10:11] Because when you do a behavior,

[10:13] do you do it to get something to change

[10:14] or to improve your life in some way, right?

[10:16] Words I like, I start the email here

[10:19] because I want someone even in less

[10:21] than the time it takes to read the email

[10:23] to immediately be rewarded for clicking and opening.

[10:25] For me, a quote or tweet is something that's in one glance,

[10:29] they can be rewarded for taking the first action.

[10:31] That's the first thing I'm doing.

[10:32] Now, the next thing is that I have kind of the meat

[10:35] of my email.

[10:36] Now, for me, my meat of the email,

[10:38] I keep under, I think 200 words

[10:41] because it's roughly a minute.

[10:42] And so that's been kind of like the Mozi Money minute

[10:44] kind of promise.

[10:45] Having said, we also didn't other emails that are really long.

[10:47] So, Layla sends emails to the kind of like the most qualified

[10:49] businesses on the list that we have that,

[10:52] you know, drain the most revenue

[10:53] and hers tend to be a little bit longer

[10:54] and that's because she tends to teach more of your story.

[10:58] I have a little bit more like tactical style.

[11:00] Her emails do great too.

[11:01] So, I wanna make sure that this doesn't seem like rule of law.

[11:04] I wanna explain why I wrote my emails this way.

[11:05] So, we have our tactic.

[11:07] And I very clearly, there's a lot of times where I'm like,

[11:10] man, I could put this other thing in.

[11:11] One concept, just keep it on one thing.

[11:13] Because as soon as you start and you're not writing a book here,

[11:16] it's just what is one very clear thing

[11:18] and I just keep cutting it down until it's like,

[11:20] this is what's happening.

[11:22] And so, you want to basically introduce a problem

[11:24] or condition that makes the solution viable.

[11:27] So, no matter how good your product is,

[11:29] a stranger will believe you because you're biased.

[11:31] Okay, so that's a problem.

[11:32] If strangers don't believe you, okay?

[11:34] So, the easiest way to overcome this,

[11:35] it's overwhelming social proof.

[11:37] Okay, there's a solution.

[11:38] But now, how do I do that?

[11:39] And so, then I put a little extra on it.

[11:41] And Zet, so if you business is doing,

[11:43] here's an easy tactic to display tons of proof,

[11:45] you already have, but aren't showing.

[11:46] This is one where they already have all this stuff.

[11:48] There are sixes of away from gold,

[11:49] and we seem to cross the barrier.

[11:51] And so, I just said, cool, if you're brick and mortar,

[11:53] print out every five-store review,

[11:54] screen chat at a cross-store review sites online,

[11:56] then frame it with one dollar frames

[11:57] you can get from the dollar store,

[11:58] cover your lobby, floor to ceiling with them,

[12:00] and see the PS statement for a real example.

[12:02] So, that also, and that's a little bit of foreshattering,

[12:04] I'll show you, for something else that we do in the email.

[12:06] Now, if you're online, then you read the one for online.

[12:08] After that, it's like, cool, I delivered my one minute of value,

[12:11] that any business owner can immediately use in their business,

[12:13] because almost every business has a few five-store reviews

[12:16] on some platform that they can immediately repurpose

[12:20] to get strangers to believe them more,

[12:21] and then ultimately some more stuff.

[12:22] I have my little sign off, and underneath,

[12:24] I have a CTA, so I've had your for scaling your business go here,

[12:27] if you want to start a business go here.

[12:28] So, this goes to school, this goes to acquisition.com,

[12:31] for workshops, because that's for businesses

[12:33] that we're not necessarily gonna do a deal with,

[12:34] or maybe we'll do one in the future,

[12:36] it's just an easy way for us to meet them.

[12:37] So, it's just like, cool, come fly out, we'd love to meet you.

[12:40] Okay, so, PS, I always have a PS statement in every email,

[12:43] because beyond the headline, it's the most red part of the email.

[12:46] So, not having a PS statement is PS stupid.

[12:49] So, have one.

[12:50] The thing is, is that I think about this as, again,

[12:53] what if they just done?

[12:53] So, they have now read my email.

[12:55] So, I want to reward them for reading my email,

[12:59] and I want to encourage people to click,

[13:00] because one of the things that I think a lot of people

[13:02] try not to do is try to get people not to click,

[13:05] or send to many of the links.

[13:06] So, sending to many of the links is a bad thing.

[13:07] So, that's true.

[13:08] In terms of getting someone to click,

[13:09] you want to regularly get people to click,

[13:11] because you want your audience to be rewarded

[13:13] for clicking in general.

[13:14] And so, if you have a blog that you send out,

[13:16] don't put the blog in the email,

[13:17] put a really interesting nugget from the blog in the email,

[13:20] and then click there so that they can read it.

[13:21] And so, you're just returning the audience

[13:23] and rewarding them, ideally if the blog is good,

[13:25] they will do it again.

[13:26] Just like, most of you may admit it,

[13:28] if your blog is good, it'll increase the likelihood

[13:30] again, if your blog is bad or emails are bad,

[13:32] they'll decrease it.

[13:33] And so, this is why I see this very much as content,

[13:35] because it has to be good,

[13:36] and think about the alternative scenario.

[13:38] If you have four game emails and then one terrible one,

[13:41] it can just like that one was just so useless

[13:43] that they're like, ah, I'm not gonna do this again.

[13:45] I would rather just extend a period of time

[13:47] where I haven't talked to somebody

[13:49] and just make sure that what I send them is good.

[13:50] And long term, if people don't open your emails,

[13:54] then you'll eventually end up in the promo tab,

[13:56] which is kind of like email death,

[13:57] like knowing it really checks that.

[13:58] Even if you have good stuff,

[13:59] and so you want to obviously get people

[14:01] to read your emails quickly.

[14:04] So that's one email.

[14:05] Now let's talk about different tactic.

[14:06] So mobile optimized design.

[14:08] So right now, 58%, 60% of global internet traffic

[14:13] is mobile devices.

[14:14] And what's crazy is that a lot of people's emails

[14:16] are not optimized for mobile viewership,

[14:19] and that's where a lot of people are actually

[14:20] gonna be reading your thing.

[14:21] And so you wanna make sure that you look at your emails

[14:24] on a desktop format and on a mobile format

[14:26] so that they display the right way

[14:28] for the viewing platform they're being viewed through.

[14:31] When you do that, all you do is,

[14:32] first objective of email,

[14:33] increase the likelihood they can read.

[14:35] And this is especially true if you had images

[14:37] to your emails, this is more like e-commerce,

[14:39] doesn't a lot of this.

[14:40] That's where like images can get totally messed up, not look good.

[14:43] It just looks unprofessional and totally plummetes

[14:45] that click through rates for your emails.

[14:47] Number four, consistent layout slash format.

[14:49] I tend to love templates.

[14:51] I love to just figure out what works

[14:54] and then do it over and over and over again.

[14:55] So in the beginning, you might experiment a little bit,

[14:57] but if you see that a certain format gets more responses

[15:00] or more click throughs, then it's like cool,

[15:01] let's just do that over and over again.

[15:02] And so you'll notice that the most of my new minutes

[15:04] more or less have the same format.

[15:06] They have the thing, they have the content,

[15:08] they have the CTA and then they have some sort of PSA

[15:10] and it's or the CTA's, the PS statement.

[15:12] But that's included in every single one of them.

[15:14] I want people to know what they're going to get.

[15:16] Think about McDonald's.

[15:17] It's like, I don't want any surprises.

[15:18] I'm expecting a big Mac, I want fries, I want my Coke.

[15:21] And so today's big Mac, fries and Coke

[15:22] is different than yesterday's, but I don't want it to be different.

[15:25] It's not the same burger,

[15:26] but I want it to still be just as good.

[15:28] So let's rock on the second one.

[15:30] Same thing, let's see what he meant it.

[15:31] 309% increase in sales from one change.

[15:33] Okay, that's interesting.

[15:34] I'd be like, I would click that.

[15:36] So words I like, so this is the immediate reward.

[15:38] Ideally for them clicking, so there's like,

[15:40] cool, I got some value from that.

[15:41] And I just used tested stuff because I just used the tweets

[15:43] that I know that people have shared the most.

[15:44] And so hopefully also, you might get people

[15:46] who share your newsletter or your emails as well,

[15:48] which is kind of the point.

[15:49] Now, after that, I've got my content bucket.

[15:52] Again, this is under 200ish words.

[15:54] I just try to remind people that I keep this promise.

[15:56] Like, that's all.

[15:56] Kept us under a minute.

[15:57] Awesome.

[15:58] Then I have my CTA and then I have my PS statement.

[16:01] And so you'll notice this very common theme.

[16:02] So similar subject, reward them for that.

[16:06] Meet of the content, CTA, PS statement.

[16:09] You can alter it like, where the CTA is where the PS statements,

[16:11] like these things, I think you can alter around.

[16:13] Because a lot of times I just make memes for my PS statement.

[16:17] I don't think there's any signs around it.

[16:18] I just think it's fun.

[16:19] You can do that, or you can obviously have your PS statement,

[16:21] B or CTA for whatever it is.

[16:22] All of those are kind of viable.

[16:24] I don't like rules in general.

[16:25] The fundamentals are always going to be

[16:27] to reward for every step in the process.

[16:29] So because I can provide value to you in under a minute,

[16:31] I'll also tell you what this tactic was.

[16:33] So speed to contact.

[16:34] So I believe in this so much,

[16:35] I started almost starting to fund a buying business.

[16:37] This is just implement this one tactic.

[16:38] So it's simple to understand.

[16:39] It's hard to do.

[16:40] But if you can do it in a few minutes.

[16:41] So you call leads within 60 seconds of opting in.

[16:43] So Harvard Business Republic is a study that

[16:45] demonstrated an average of 391% increase in sales.

[16:48] 390% increase in sales.

[16:51] So let me ask you this.

[16:52] Right now, is there anything else

[16:54] that you have on your docket that could quadruple the sales

[16:57] of your business?

[16:58] No.

[16:58] Well, then that would basically mean that calling leads fast

[17:02] should be the first priority that you have

[17:05] because it could quadruple your sales.

[17:07] Because if there's nothing else that can do it,

[17:08] then that should be the priority of the business.

[17:10] And if you're like, man, I don't have the sales staff

[17:12] to be able to have that kind of coverage.

[17:14] Well, you can afford that sales staff with the 391% increase

[17:18] in sales that you're going to get as a result.

[17:20] I love tactics like this that are just massive

[17:23] unlocks and businesses.

[17:24] And that's the type of stuff that we go over in RCA

[17:26] workshops, which is why I was in CTX.

[17:28] Next, tactical nugget.

[17:29] So optimized preview text.

[17:31] So this is one that I actually learned more recently

[17:33] for our staff.

[17:34] So maybe embarrassing, whatever.

[17:36] Optimizing preview text for the email.

[17:38] So you don't want to look at your all of your emails.

[17:39] You see the bold subject.

[17:41] And then after that, you've got that little bit of text

[17:42] afterwards.

[17:43] That little bit of text is kind of like the,

[17:45] when you hover on a YouTube video

[17:47] and it shows you a couple of clips.

[17:48] It's the preview, right?

[17:49] And so that preview has a big impact on how many people

[17:52] choose to open the email.

[17:54] And so right now, it has for us had an increase of 24%.

[17:59] And just to give you an idea here, 24% of people,

[18:01] so one out of four people, check that text before they even open.

[18:04] And so that's what they reported.

[18:05] I would bet it's even higher than that.

[18:07] It takes 10 seconds to do this and is so worth it

[18:10] because if you don't, then it'll just take the first 150

[18:13] characters of your email, which made of just like,

[18:14] hey, John, Bob, it doesn't, it's, it's not valuable, right?

[18:19] And so we want to pull the most valuable nuggets forward,

[18:21] especially things that induce curiosity.

[18:23] Next text will not get clear CTA.

[18:25] So I'm not gonna harp on like,

[18:26] of course you want to have a reason to do it

[18:28] and you have a reason to do it now and tell me exactly

[18:30] what they get.

[18:31] Those are, you know, CTA 101.

[18:32] But I think that having basically continued interest CTA

[18:38] and then have a, I want to take action in buy CTA

[18:41] are not terrible ideas to have in an email.

[18:43] And so I'm not saying like, I don't,

[18:44] I'm not one of these people who's like,

[18:46] only have one link, only have one CTA.

[18:48] I think you can have more than one,

[18:50] but it's more that you only want to have one per audience

[18:53] or per objective.

[18:54] Now if you have five, then that can get,

[18:56] you know, kind of aggressive overall,

[18:57] but I think one or two, your safe,

[18:59] as long as there's a clear reason

[19:00] that someone would click one versus the other.

[19:02] All right, let's rock another one.

[19:03] So, most of you, many minutes.

[19:04] So easy 21% profit increase for recurring businesses.

[19:07] So boom, reinforce if you grow your business

[19:10] without fixing your problems,

[19:11] you grow your problems instead.

[19:12] Eek.

[19:13] All right, so ain't a renewing fee.

[19:15] So this works for any business, recurring or reoccurring,

[19:17] but especially recurring, obviously.

[19:18] So if you have a membership recurring revenue model

[19:20] and keep you lower for a year,

[19:21] there's a great profit tactic that adds a ton of revenue.

[19:24] So it's a one-time annual fee on top of your monthly.

[19:27] So it doesn't interfere with front-and-sales

[19:29] because it happens a year later.

[19:30] So it's not immediate.

[19:31] So people don't not sign up because of this fee.

[19:34] And if someone stays a year,

[19:35] they're also very unlikely to leave.

[19:36] And so the fee is usually the price of about one to three months

[19:39] and by adding it in, you add 8 to 24% to your revenue

[19:42] without incurring any cost.

[19:43] So if you have a call at a 20% margin business

[19:46] and you add another 20% revenue

[19:47] with no added cost,

[19:48] you double the profit of the business from one thing,

[19:51] which is by adding an annual renewal fee in.

[19:53] And so this allows you to keep your advertised

[19:56] or your advertised pricing

[19:57] because that's what influences your conversions

[19:58] whatever your monthly price says.

[19:59] But then also get the benefit of having a profit

[20:02] of basically a price that's about eight-ish to 25% more

[20:07] than your current in terms of annualized.

[20:08] And so for example, if I charge $39 a month,

[20:11] I might make my annual renewal in 99, so that's two months.

[20:14] This takes my annual revenue per customer

[20:16] from 468 to 567.

[20:19] It's a 21% increase.

[20:20] And so it makes my effective monthly rate,

[20:22] 47 per month.

[20:23] So look at the difference here.

[20:24] But if I had it, 47, I might convert significantly

[20:27] if you were customers.

[20:27] And so this kind of blends the benefits of a lower cost up front

[20:31] but gets the benefits of the higher price.

[20:34] And that's why it's such a cool tactic.

[20:35] Very effective if you use it well.

[20:36] So again, CTA and then this one was a funny one.

[20:39] With the other ones were more tactical,

[20:41] this one is like, hey, here's how it, it's just a funny meme.

[20:43] So in the spirit of PS statements,

[20:46] if you like these types of tactics and want 60 seconds

[20:49] things that you can immediately use

[20:50] to make more money in your business,

[20:51] you can just go to acquisition.com forward slash newsletter.

[20:54] And you can opt in there.

[20:55] And I'll just keep sending you this stuff twice a week,

[20:56] which actually brings me up to the next point

[20:58] before I get to the next female,

[21:00] which is how often should you send female?

[21:02] And to whom should you send it?

[21:03] Big picture after talking to the best female marketers

[21:06] I knew before deciding to start my newsletter.

[21:09] Number one is the perfect cadence

[21:11] seems to be around three times a week.

[21:13] All right, now again, I don't like rules.

[21:15] And if you hate rules as much as I do,

[21:17] then nothing is a rule.

[21:18] You could send to, you could send one, whatever.

[21:20] But most people found that basically,

[21:21] the more often you email, the more you will

[21:24] could verse, kinda like more content.

[21:25] But there is a spot where people are like,

[21:26] I'm getting bothered.

[21:27] But the thing is, that's why I feel like

[21:29] putting more effort into making the emails high quality,

[21:32] pays dividends.

[21:33] Because think about it like this.

[21:34] If you send someone stuff that always makes the money,

[21:37] then how much would they like you to send them?

[21:39] Tons.

[21:40] And so that's why I'm a big fan of,

[21:43] like, I don't really have promotional emails per se.

[21:46] I'd rather just have every email be valuable.

[21:48] And then just say, like, hey, if you found this valuable,

[21:50] you can go here.

[21:51] And that way, I don't have to balance,

[21:52] like, what's my give ask ratio or anything like that?

[21:54] It's like, I'm just gonna only purely provide value here,

[21:57] just like content.

[21:58] And if you want to take next steps towards doing

[22:01] or working with us or something like that,

[22:02] then you click the link that's made easily and available to you.

[22:05] So to me, I see like, just having your link

[22:07] or like what you do or whatever your lead magnet is,

[22:09] and there is kinda like having your link in bio.

[22:11] So like, if they want to find out more,

[22:13] you just make it easy for them.

[22:15] So cadence wise, if you haven't started yet,

[22:17] start with once a month, and then you can move on.

[22:19] But I will say this, and this is the thing

[22:21] that broke the barrier for me, is that I actually was like,

[22:23] okay, how many emails do I wanna send?

[22:25] And so I said, okay, I will commit to twice a month.

[22:28] And so I actually sat down and wrote 24 emails,

[22:30] and it took me like half a day, and then I thought,

[22:32] well, shoot, I could have been doing this

[22:34] off a half day's work, I could have been emailing my whole list

[22:36] for a year.

[22:37] And so after I saw how, I don't wanna say easy it was,

[22:39] but how I could do it, I then decided to commit to doing it,

[22:42] and now we do significantly more than that.

[22:44] But that was kinda like that.

[22:45] If you just write 12 emails, then you're like, cool,

[22:47] I've actually written all my emails for the year,

[22:48] and then everything else on top, that's bonus.

[22:50] And the reason I'm even making this video,

[22:52] because it's not typical for me to talk about something

[22:55] that I haven't done for an extended period of time.

[22:56] But I had such a positive response from Mosination,

[23:00] from the Mosinone Minute, that I thought I would make this video

[23:04] for you, because honestly, like, this is one of the,

[23:05] I would say honestly, one of the biggest mistakes

[23:07] I made in my career was,

[23:08] I waited so long to email it,

[23:10] I actually almost all my businesses,

[23:11] like Jim launch, I didn't email until like two or three years in,

[23:14] which is insane.

[23:15] It's just saying no to money, and I should have just done it.

[23:19] It was just the amount of effort that it took,

[23:21] I didn't wanna add something else to my plate,

[23:22] because I was always so spread then.

[23:24] But now that I understand how much the return for email,

[23:28] per unit of effort, it's totally worth it.

[23:30] And I'll give you a side note,

[23:32] like we didn't do any email fall-in school

[23:34] for a different reason we had some technical stuff,

[23:35] because we wanted to do it through the platform.

[23:36] And then as soon as we started doing,

[23:38] email fall-in, we got a 40% lifting conversion.

[23:41] So it's like, Dear God,

[23:42] like, what else is gonna get you that kind of lift?

[23:45] And again, it's free, strongly recommend doing it,

[23:47] start with once a month, get them all,

[23:49] just block them all out and be like,

[23:51] okay, I've got that done.

[23:52] And then every time you feel like motivated to do it,

[23:54] you can just add on top, and it's just gravy, it's bonus.

[23:56] I personally also like committing to a cadence.

[23:58] I don't really commit anywhere to a cadence.

[24:00] I never want to feel like I have to make something,

[24:03] because then whenever I have to make it,

[24:05] it's not as good as I wanted to be.

[24:08] And so I'd rather just have a quality threshold

[24:10] that if I've got two good ones in me,

[24:12] than two is what's gonna go out.

[24:13] If I've got four in me, four is what's gonna go out.

[24:15] But if I've got zero, it's zero.

[24:17] Let's talk about tactical nuggies,

[24:20] which is the actual stuff inside of the email.

[24:23] And so we want email, if you think about the hypothetical

[24:26] ideal email, it should be one that looks like emails

[24:29] that you would exchange every day.

[24:30] And so oftentimes, emails that you exchange every day

[24:32] are pretty much all-text, a handful of sentences,

[24:35] and then that's about it.

[24:37] Maybe a link, maybe not a link.

[24:38] There's usually not a lot of images.

[24:40] And so we want our emails to approximate that

[24:43] as closely as possible.

[24:45] Because the equal opposite of that

[24:46] is that it looks like the biggest strip inside of the email.

[24:48] That looks like a hundred percent promotion,

[24:50] which then the algorithm, you know,

[24:51] AI's pretty smart nowadays, they're like,

[24:53] oh, this is just promotion,

[24:54] and so that they can put it into the promo tab.

[24:56] And so you want it to just look like an email.

[24:58] And so you want it to be as much text as possible.

[25:01] For us, we don't send images.

[25:02] And if you do have the link,

[25:03] it's, you've got one, maybe two links in their max.

[25:06] And we've also noticed that if we put more money

[25:09] stuff in an email, it tends to get a higher percentage

[25:11] in the promo tab.

[25:12] And so I try to remove money language from the text itself

[25:16] to increase likely to get to the right place.

[25:18] If you're like, why do I even bother making it only plain text?

[25:20] Why do I even bother only limiting the number of links?

[25:22] Why do I bother having less money in the title?

[25:26] Why don't even bother asking the reply?

[25:28] Why don't I just send it to them automatically

[25:29] for whatever the lead magnet is?

[25:30] Well, I'll tell you why.

[25:31] Right now, for B2B, 16.9% of marketing emails,

[25:35] don't even get into the inbox.

[25:37] Let alone promo tab.

[25:38] They don't even make it.

[25:39] And so that's because of your domain authority.

[25:42] And so basically, you have a reputation

[25:44] with the email servers on how good or how high quality

[25:47] the emails that you send are.

[25:49] And so by doing these steps, it's kind of like a hundred

[25:51] going to be, there's no one, one silver bullet

[25:53] that solves all this stuff.

[25:54] It's just consistently providing emails

[25:56] that people engage with and that they do click

[25:58] and that they do open, that they do read.

[25:59] Those are all indications that the stuff

[26:01] that you're sending is high quality

[26:02] and that it's improving their overall email experience.

[26:05] And so just like every other platform,

[26:07] I will make this very strong statement,

[26:09] which is, don't try and figure out hacks,

[26:11] try and simply align what you do with the objective

[26:14] of the platform.

[26:15] The objective of an email provider is that they provide

[26:18] the highest quality email experience

[26:20] and sift out the few important emails,

[26:23] because that thing about a terrible experience.

[26:25] If someone's like, hey, I sent you the email

[26:27] and I'm like, I didn't get it.

[26:29] And they're like, yeah, I sent it.

[26:30] And then I look at them like, I'm not,

[26:31] I'm, you know, Google is taking all these important emails.

[26:34] I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,

[26:35] I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,

[26:36] I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,

[26:37] I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,

[26:39] I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,

[26:41] I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,

[26:44] I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,

[26:46] I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,

[26:49] I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,

[26:51] I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,

[26:53] I can sit or switching email providers.

[26:55] And let me give you a 201 advanced tactic.

[26:58] If you want an even higher click-through rate and deliverbilly rate,

[27:01] make the link something that's Google native.

[27:03] And so if I want to send a YouTube link,

[27:05] then that'll probably have a higher deliverbility.

[27:07] If I want to send a sales letter,

[27:08] I can have it be accessing Google Drive,

[27:10] because they understand what the file is.

[27:12] If I want to send a VSL,

[27:13] I can also have it uploaded to Google Drive.

[27:15] And so sometimes these kind of like,

[27:17] hokey, more duck-taped look together,

[27:19] type assets that you might send.

[27:21] Sometimes it actually convert even better.

[27:23] So if you haven't tested it out, worth a shot.

[27:25] Next Nuggy is AB testing subject lines.

[27:28] So I told you that I'm trying to build the brand of MoziMoney

[27:31] minute, and so I'm willing to sacrifice a little bit

[27:33] of short-term open-right so that long-term

[27:35] the audience that becomes hard-core about MoziMoney

[27:37] minute will just always open the MoziMoney minute.

[27:39] But even so, the things after MoziMoney minute

[27:41] will still have an influence on that.

[27:43] And so having an AB split test for your headline

[27:46] or your subject will test for a small percentage

[27:49] on AB and then once it has the winner,

[27:51] we'll then send the rest of the list,

[27:53] the winning combination.

[27:55] And this more and more platforms

[27:57] are getting intelligent about this like YouTube

[27:59] does the same thing for thumbnails and headlines.

[28:01] Because some of you guys are like,

[28:02] I see you're switching this out.

[28:03] It's like duh.

[28:04] We have this split test.

[28:05] Of course, we're going to split test it.

[28:06] But the same thing works for email.

[28:07] So that's a perfect segue to,

[28:09] okay, well, how do I get people

[28:11] too opt into my list?

[28:12] And so what I want to do is I'll read you the email

[28:14] that comes in after you opt in.

[28:17] And so one of the things that I do is

[28:18] I like to, like when I write my books,

[28:20] I always inevitably write a couple chapters

[28:22] that are really valuable chapters,

[28:24] but don't like really, don't flow with the whole books

[28:26] kind of theme, but they're still really good.

[28:29] And so rather than just like toss them

[28:31] or use them as like a YouTube script,

[28:33] I still finish them and make them book quality.

[28:35] But I just peel them out and say,

[28:37] hey, I'll just give this to you when you opt into my list.

[28:40] And I have other chapters that I've written

[28:42] that like when we do our next launch,

[28:43] I'll have those as bonuses for doing it.

[28:45] And so the only people that get them though

[28:47] is the people who are on the list.

[28:49] And so I like to have little bonuses

[28:52] that are platform specific

[28:54] that give people reasons to also be subscribed there.

[28:57] And so it's like if I could do something like that

[28:59] on YouTube, I would, but I have to do it through a link.

[29:02] So at least on email, I can make something

[29:04] that gives people a reason to sign up

[29:06] beyond just immediately getting tactics

[29:08] that will always make them more money.

[29:09] This one breaks the mold,

[29:10] but I want to walk through why I think this email is important.

[29:13] And so first thing is I have a little bit of anticipation

[29:15] I've got a big announcement that's coming, right?

[29:17] And as long as you're subscribed,

[29:18] you're going to find out about it first.

[29:19] On top of that, I deliver on my promise

[29:21] that's reinforcing them, opting in in general.

[29:23] And then on top of that,

[29:25] you want them to engage with the email.

[29:26] So there's a couple things here.

[29:27] So when you reply to an email,

[29:29] then remember I said earlier about the promo tab.

[29:31] Well, when someone replies to an email,

[29:33] then you kind of get reinforced in terms of the algorithm

[29:35] of the servers like, oh,

[29:36] this is something that they're engaged with.

[29:38] And so you want people to engage.

[29:40] And so for us, once you reply,

[29:42] yes, then we send you the chapters.

[29:43] So that gives them a reason to do it.

[29:45] And so you can have your opt-in, have a widget.

[29:47] When they opt-in, explain the value of why they should stay on,

[29:49] not just get the widget,

[29:50] because I think that's just as or more important.

[29:52] If someone opts into your list,

[29:54] just to get the lead magnet,

[29:56] then they just want the lead magnet.

[29:57] They don't want regular communication from you.

[29:59] So I want to sell them on regular communication from me,

[30:01] plus by the way, here's that thing.

[30:03] And I put that near the end because it's like,

[30:05] you have their attention until you give them the immediate reward

[30:08] that was promised, which you obviously have to do.

[30:10] But I would rather say, hey, by the way,

[30:11] here's the other things that you're going to get that I get.

[30:12] So it's like, I want to surprise in the light with the stuff that

[30:15] I'm providing them before I give them the other thing that I've

[30:17] of course I'm going to provide.

[30:18] You'd like to have this tiny, tiny moment where they have huge motivation.

[30:22] And it's just like you just want to capitalize on it.

[30:24] And think about everything as reinforcement loops.

[30:26] And so people opt it in for this lead magnet.

[30:28] They can get the email by replying, yes.

[30:30] Now, I also want to resell them on doing this.

[30:32] So inside the secret chapter, it reveals things like,

[30:35] how to get people to engage with your stuff.

[30:37] You otherwise wouldn't.

[30:38] So whenever I get a new market,

[30:39] I almost always start with this.

[30:41] How to make your advertising nine and a half times as profitable.

[30:44] There are two things you need to pull this off and it's on page five.

[30:46] So putting the actual pages like, oh, this is actually like it's right in there.

[30:49] The most powerful awful of all time, this will never expire.

[30:51] Five ways to add hoops that increase lead quality.

[30:53] The four ways to display discounts.

[30:55] And there's a lot more.

[30:56] But this is a solid start on how to design a winning acquisition strategy.

[30:59] So inside of here, I have multiple things that I'm sending them.

[31:01] And they just have to reply, yes.

[31:02] So it's cool.

[31:03] I've sold you in this these four lines on why you should stay subscribed.

[31:06] And then all of this chunk is to get them to reply, yes.

[31:10] Because even though they said they wanted it's like, I really need them to reply.

[31:13] So that I can take myself to not the promo tap.

[31:16] And if you play out the alternative scenario, which is that you give a bad lead magnet or you just immediately send the lead magnet with nothing else.

[31:22] All right, which is both of those are I consider bad scenarios.

[31:25] If you send a good lead magnet, but you don't sell them on staying, they'll just immediately unsubscribe.

[31:29] Or just get the thing and then just never check anything again.

[31:31] The other scenario is that they do follow the steps.

[31:35] And then they read the lead magnet and say all of that work wasn't worth it.

[31:37] And that is like the single thing that I keep seeing up at night.

[31:41] And so I just want to make sure that I always give a positive return on time relative to anything else someone could consume.

[31:47] And so if we're talking about open rates, then the next thing that you're going to talk about is click through rates.

[31:52] Because fundamentally you want them to take action.

[31:54] And so a lot of the market of email marketers has actually shifted towards tracking CTR over open rates.

[32:01] And I think the biggest reason for that was because Apple privacy law is to mean very difficult to track open rates.

[32:06] And so I'll give you what our stats are just as maybe a benchmark.

[32:09] So for us over the last three months our average revenue is just under 36% so 35.7.

[32:15] And our average CTR is 8.5.

[32:17] So we have a very strong CTR.

[32:19] So I don't know how accurate the open rate stat that I just shared is.

[32:22] I just know that that's what we get reporting back on.

[32:24] But CTR as we feel very confident on that CTR typically get parks between two things.

[32:29] One is percentage of all people you set to two who took action or clicked.

[32:33] And then also percentage of people who opened who clicked.

[32:37] So it's like, okay, so if I had 100,000 people and I got 30,000 to open my email and I got 10,000 to click,

[32:44] then it would show a 33% percent of people who opened clicked.

[32:49] But overall I would have a 10% of the 100,000 10,000 who actually clicked and took the next step.

[32:56] And so for us because they didn't have to be 8,500 for every 100,000 that we sent, which is pretty crazy.

[33:01] It's pretty good.

[33:02] And so that is what I would be optimizing on my effort for.

[33:05] But I'd be optimizing that overall longer period.

[33:07] So think about it less about each email.

[33:09] But think about what my overall CTR is for my emails in general.

[33:14] Because there are some emails that you're like, you don't need to make the,

[33:17] quote, click ask as hard.

[33:18] But we want to balance that over time.

[33:20] So we're kind of like depositing before we withdraw a little bit.

[33:22] I'm going to give you three timing tactics around emails.

[33:25] These are all just golden babies.

[33:26] Things that just give you kind of tiny little lifts in terms of your overall performance.

[33:30] So if you're sending, let's say, one email a week, then you might as well maximize the likelihood and affect him to that email.

[33:35] And so if you're beat a C, it seems like Mondays and Tuesdays tend to be better days overall.

[33:40] And so there's an average increase in over rate of about 18%.

[33:42] For beat a C. So business consumer.

[33:44] Now if you're beat a B, this kind of interesting.

[33:46] It's Wednesday.

[33:47] That's actually the bigger lift day.

[33:48] And actually it's about comparable to the beat a C lift.

[33:51] So it's I see that it's like there's just a time period for more people that

[33:55] consumers are more distracted call it on Mondays and Tuesdays, whereas business people beat a B are like working Mondays and just like they get they get to catch catch their breath on Wednesday.

[34:06] Now I could just be adding a narrative to this who knows.

[34:08] But fundamentally the stature there and this is across the zillions of emails.

[34:11] I got that from Neil Patel. He's an awesome marketer.

[34:13] And so he shared that with me in terms of days.

[34:15] The last tactic is around what time of day.

[34:17] So that was days of week.

[34:18] But the next is time of day.

[34:19] And so there seems like there's two sweet spots that occur.

[34:22] And one is basically right before launch and right after lunch.

[34:25] So it's like tend to noon and then one to three are the kind of like these these sweet spots where they open.

[34:30] The first thing in the morning, I think is typically a very competitive time because there's so many actual real business emails that they're going through that they're like,

[34:37] I got to do with this stuff first.

[34:39] If you kind of slide in in those times, you tend to see bigger improvements.

[34:42] Now that'll be more specific for businesses that are local.

[34:45] When you're across time zones, I wouldn't lose too much sleep over it.

[34:48] For us, we do it all our stuff off PSD, but I know that I've got a three hour window if I'm just looking at US.

[34:53] And if half my audience is international, which it is, that's going to be more relevant for the people who only transact in one time zone.

[34:59] So with that being said, let's look at this puppy.

[35:02] So this, this email did exceptionally well.

[35:04] There's most of you might have been about testimonials that convert.

[35:06] And so the perspective, which people by time poor people by stuff and business people by skills,

[35:11] lazy people by distraction.

[35:12] And so I put that one in there because for the week, it was a super high performer in terms of tweets.

[35:16] And this email also got plenty, it's so funny because I got so many tags of people screenshotting my email

[35:21] and putting that on their story, which amazing, right?

[35:25] Because normally email lists only grow from you driving it.

[35:28] But how amazing would it be if your email list itself brought other people in, right?

[35:32] And that's, at least for me, that's Michael.

[35:34] So the actual tactile, no, I'll give it to you right now.

[35:36] So attorney testimony is in to ads is very profitable, but often very tough.

[35:39] So it's like cool, there's a problem, right?

[35:41] And so the main reason is people suck at making testimony.

[35:44] After reviewing all the testimonials and what separated the best from the rest,

[35:47] there is one thing the top four all had in common, which is a pain-based hook.

[35:50] And so these were my top four hooks of all time.

[35:53] This was just for gym most specifically.

[35:54] So I looked over 2500 testimonials and so these were the top four hooks.

[35:58] So we were too much away from setting our doors.

[36:00] We were barely making enough surveillance.

[36:01] So this is different ads.

[36:02] I paid payroll, rent, and I'd finish the month was zero dollars a profit.

[36:05] I paid all my expensive remote work all day and ended up was zero dollars a profit.

[36:08] So kind of interesting that there's two zero dollars a profit in the top four of all time.

[36:12] Different guys.

[36:13] There was no script there.

[36:14] Like that's like my marker had like interesting zero zero, they both did zero dollars of profit.

[36:18] But I find fascinating.

[36:19] If those hooks and the hook is one of the most important parts of any ad,

[36:23] then we should obsess about what the testimonial hooks are.

[36:26] So we get more people to watch them.

[36:28] And so then it's like, okay, so the next time you record a testimony or ask for one,

[36:32] don't ask them how life was before they started working with you.

[36:34] Because they're going to give you this very long story.

[36:36] It's not going to be hard to find a really good hook.

[36:38] So instead just ask them for their worst moment.

[36:39] Just say, what was the worst moment?

[36:40] Because that's what all of these were.

[36:42] It's a moment.

[36:43] And so the moments are what makes hooks.

[36:44] The details were make them powerful.

[36:46] And so it wasn't just like, oh, we were struggling.

[36:48] It says we were barely making enough to survive.

[36:50] We were too much away from shutting our doors.

[36:52] Like that's much more visceral than stuff was hard.

[36:56] Right.

[36:57] And so then of course, we have our CTA per use.

[37:00] And one of the things that I've learned with CTAs across content including email is a lot of people do the same copy

[37:07] or I even see YouTubers like take their mini ads and just like slice them in.

[37:12] They're running a different shirt or it's a different energy or whatever.

[37:14] I think that's a huge mistake.

[37:15] It's like if you think about the reason that you make stuff,

[37:18] it's to increase the likelihood that people convert in the future or to convert them now.

[37:22] And so if you want to increase the likelihood that they convert,

[37:25] then why wouldn't you just take, like if that's the most important part,

[37:28] shorter, not long term, then why wouldn't you take the extra minute or 30 minutes even

[37:33] to just like make it contextual.

[37:35] And so if you've noticed even my YouTube videos like this, you know,

[37:38] the CTA for this video was around the email.

[37:40] It's contextual, right?

[37:41] If I have a thing for beginners, then it would probably be around school.

[37:44] If I have something that's really high level around like enterprise value,

[37:47] then scaling workshop for aquas in knock-home or the portfolio itself would be the CTA.

[37:50] And so making the CTA itself obviously related to the content,

[37:55] but also how you bridge into the CTA.

[37:57] And so if you like tactics like these degree of business, you'll find,

[38:00] love our actually, this is a terrible fucking CTA.

[38:02] I should have said something more around, I should have linked this more to testimonials,

[38:05] so room for improvement, but this one still did really well.

[38:08] And so yeah, like FYI, 25% of our rooms are over $5 million in revenue,

[38:11] and 50% of our money.

[38:12] So it's just kind of gives an idea of the quality of the room that people can go to.

[38:15] Stay rich, and then I have a funny meme at the end because I like memes.

[38:18] And so big picture, same format, boom, reward them for opening,

[38:23] boom, reward them for reading, adjct in the middle, make it contextual.

[38:27] And if you do that even once a month, you won't make less money.

[38:31] And so hey guys, we actually just redid our organic opt-in for this, for our email.

[38:37] And so the newest one should be underneath of this video.

[38:41] And it's actually because I have something very, very juicy that's coming out in the next 30 days.

[38:46] It's not what you think, but it's really fucking good.

[38:49] I've spent a tremendous amount of time on it, and I will predict that a lot of people will,

[38:53] it'll be a canon thing within the, you know, the, the mozination world.

[38:57] I'll just, I'll just leave it at that.

[38:59] You won't want to miss it. If you want that, and to opt into these lovely, very tactical,

[39:05] email value bombs that are consistently coming in on a regular basis that take less than 60 seconds to read.

[00:00] You're not making as much as you want because you probably have sucky customers.

[00:04] When this video, I'm going to break down what that really means, why it matters and why

[00:08] is probably holding you back.

[00:09] And then finally, what to do about in terms of how to actually make the transition.

[00:12] So let's talk about what this even means big picture.

[00:15] I regularly talk to agency owners, for example,

[00:20] who are selling to small business owners,

[00:23] $1,500 a month of social media ad, social media marketing.

[00:28] And what's really interesting about this type of business is that they quickly plateau at maybe a million

[00:33] dollars a year, some time, three million dollars a year, and they come and they're like,

[00:36] what do I need to do to scale?

[00:37] And the issue is it's not about what they need to do to scale,

[00:41] but rather who they need to sell to in order to scale.

[00:44] But the reason this is so difficult to transition away from,

[00:47] it's why it's one of the seven deadly sins of business,

[00:49] is that when you have the wrong avatar,

[00:51] the volatility of your business is based on the volatility of your customers.

[00:55] For most small business owners, a $1,500 per month or $2,000 per month,

[00:59] or $2,500 per month, recurring cost is usually too high for them,

[01:04] because as soon as they have a bad month,

[01:06] they immediately cancel marketing, which of course is ridiculous,

[01:09] because if you're trying to grow, the last thing we're going to do is cancel marketing.

[01:12] But there's a reason they are small business owners,

[01:14] because they make small business owners mistakes.

[01:17] The thing is if you try to build a big business off of small businesses,

[01:20] it's basically having a terrible foundation,

[01:22] building a castle on a foundation of sand.

[01:25] As soon as the tide comes out and pulls the sand away,

[01:27] so too goes the castle.

[01:29] When I talk to these types of businesses,

[01:31] whether it's an agency or whatever,

[01:33] the point is that they ultimately have to switch through

[01:37] they sell to so that they can sell to less volatile customers.

[01:40] And one of the easiest limit tests to think about this

[01:43] for whatever industry you're in is to think about,

[01:46] what is the ultimate version of this business look like?

[01:48] Are the people who have the biggest agencies in the world,

[01:51] for example, are they selling small business owners?

[01:53] The answer is no.

[01:55] Think about it.

[01:56] The biggest agencies in the world,

[01:58] Ogle V in Mathers, you got V intermediate,

[02:00] and P Digital, some of the big,

[02:01] you know, multiple hundred million dollar

[02:02] pre-year agencies that exist out there.

[02:04] Those businesses almost exclusively sell to Fortune 500,

[02:07] sometimes mid-market businesses,

[02:10] because anybody who sells to really small businesses

[02:12] ultimately realizes, man, these guys need way more help

[02:15] than just getting leads, they don't know how to work leads,

[02:17] they don't know how to sell, they don't know how to price,

[02:19] and then all of a sudden you have to start building their business for them.

[02:22] But the problem is that you need to build your business right now,

[02:24] and you're building it on the wrong customer base.

[02:26] The reason this is one of the seven deadly sins

[02:28] is that there's usually an apparent conflict,

[02:30] meaning you can't just immediately switch,

[02:32] because what happens is, oh my God,

[02:34] if I switch, then I'm going to stop selling customers,

[02:36] stop selling customers, stop making money,

[02:37] I stop making money and I'm going to lose my business.

[02:38] But I also need to switch to selling to,

[02:40] or I'm never going to grow.

[02:41] You're going to rock in a hard place,

[02:42] which is why the seven deadly sins of business are so hard

[02:45] to break through or break free of.

[02:47] The main meat of this is that you have misalignment

[02:50] between your maximum potential product or service value

[02:53] and customers ability to realize and pay for that value.

[02:56] You could ultimately provide more value to a different customer

[02:59] than you can to a bad customer.

[03:01] But as a result of only selling to bad customers,

[03:04] you have to translate that into a lower quality or lower price service.

[03:09] It comes with very vicious cycle of you wanting to lower your price

[03:12] and then not being able to deliver as much service,

[03:14] but they need more service,

[03:15] but they can afford more service and around and around you go.

[03:18] Everything that I'm describing right now

[03:20] actually falls under a term that happens in business,

[03:23] which is called structural turn.

[03:29] Structural turn is the percentage of customers

[03:31] that leave every month not because they hate you,

[03:34] but because of something else that happens

[03:36] that's quarter their business.

[03:37] So I remember I had a friend of mine who had a CRM

[03:40] in the gym space.

[03:41] And I asked him, I said,

[03:43] why imagine that you probably keep 90% of customers

[03:46] every single year because your CRM

[03:48] like no one's going to try and leave that.

[03:49] He said, no, you'd actually be pretty surprised.

[03:51] And I was like, okay, well, what's attorney?

[03:53] He said, three percent.

[03:54] I was like, oh, pre-year, that's not bad.

[03:55] He's like, no, per month.

[03:56] I was like, three percent a month.

[03:57] And he said, yeah, the biggest reason is that

[03:59] gyms just go out of business.

[04:01] And I was like, oh, so what do you do when 30%

[04:03] of all the customers you have go out of business

[04:05] every year?

[04:06] What do you do?

[04:07] Like, is there anything you can do to change that level of turn?

[04:09] The answer is, no, they go out of business.

[04:11] There's no you can do that.

[04:12] The structural turn.

[04:13] Your business at best, in the hypothetical maximum case scenario,

[04:16] when you're selling to small businesses, in that example,

[04:19] could only get to at best 70% of customers

[04:23] changed your year.

[04:24] Now, is there a version of this business that sells

[04:26] to better version of the customer?

[04:27] Yes, of course there is, which is step two.

[04:29] Now, if you're being an enterprising

[04:31] Mofo and listening to this and thinking, well,

[04:33] there definitely are big businesses that

[04:35] smell to sell to small customers.

[04:36] There are, but they're typically not high-to-to-service

[04:39] businesses, which what the vast majority

[04:41] people do.

[04:42] It's very much like a barbell for most businesses.

[04:44] On one extreme, you have custom, and

[04:47] custom should only be sold to high end customers.

[04:50] These are people who can afford it, who have good

[04:52] businesses who are good for their word,

[04:54] when they say they're going to pay for 12 months,

[04:56] they actually pay for 12 months, because they have assets

[04:58] and they know what they're doing.

[04:59] On the other extreme, you have your very small businesses.

[05:02] You have VSMBs and SMBs, so small business owners

[05:05] and very small business owners or prosumers, if you will.

[05:07] When you have these types of customers, what do you do?

[05:10] You certainly don't offer custom.

[05:12] You offer templated solutions.

[05:14] You offer DIY solutions.

[05:17] You offer things that they can go at their own pace,

[05:19] because fundamentally, they cannot afford

[05:21] the amount of help that they need.

[05:23] That's why a lot of businesses fail,

[05:25] and that's also not your responsibility.

[05:27] It is your responsibility to make your business succeed.

[05:29] Making sure that we're picking the right customer,

[05:31] the maximized likelihood of success, is part of strategy.

[05:35] The middle is certainly where people go to die.

[05:38] This is where they go, kind of mid-price,

[05:40] and they sell to small customers.

[05:43] And the reality is this, is that these small customers,

[05:46] you can sell on mid-price.

[05:48] It's not hard to sell them.

[05:49] These things are hard to keep them.

[05:51] If you're dealing with short customer life spans,

[05:54] people are staying on average three or four months.

[05:56] You have excessive support, so they're demanding a ton for you.

[06:00] They have other requirements besides your core service

[06:03] and your core service.

[06:04] They have a lot of money.

[06:05] They have a lot of money.

[06:06] They have a lot of money.

[06:07] They have a lot of money.

[06:09] They have a lot of money.

[06:11] They have a lot of money.

[06:12] They have a lot of money.

[06:13] They have a lot of money.

[06:15] They have a lot of money.

[06:17] They have a lot of money.

[06:19] They have a lot of money.

[06:21] They have a lot of money.

[06:23] They have a lot of money.

[06:25] They have a lot of money.

[06:27] They have a lot of money.

[06:29] They have a lot of money.

[06:31] The fifth red flag is overpromising just to get people to buy.

[06:34] This is why this is a vicious cycle.

[06:35] Whether you have to build my whole business for me and maybe I'll pay you $1,000.

[06:39] It's just ridiculous.

[06:41] Only an experienced business owner is going to know, of course they're not going to do that.

[06:44] I'm an experienced business owner.

[06:45] They're going to go run their business.

[06:46] I'm going to run my business.

[06:47] But a small business owner just thinks that because this $1,000 means a ton to them,

[06:51] it should mean a ton to you.

[06:52] There's a disparity there between their expectations.

[06:54] And sometimes it doesn't even matter what you say.

[06:56] Just because the amount of money means so much to them,

[06:59] that you will ultimately have a dissatisfied customer no matter what.

[07:02] Because to them, that $1,000 might be 50% of the cash they have.

[07:07] If someone said, hey, I will help you for 50% of the cash you have.

[07:10] Imagine the expectation that person might have.

[07:12] Probably a lot.

[07:13] No matter what you say.

[07:15] And then finally, number six is that selling people, you know,

[07:18] will suck.

[07:19] This is the red flag.

[07:20] And you do that just to deliver and ultimately pay the bills.

[07:24] It's a bad way to sell.

[07:25] To recap on paper, what we just went over was the what.

[07:28] All right, these are all kind of the symptoms and the flags that happen

[07:32] when you're selling to the wrong customer.

[07:34] So we've gone over the what?

[07:36] Like what is this problem?

[07:37] So the second is going to be why it matters.

[07:40] So there's three kind of forces in acquisition.

[07:43] You've got LTV, right?

[07:45] Lifetime value per customer, basically.

[07:47] What's the gross profit?

[07:48] You're going to collect off a customer over their lifespan.

[07:50] You've got cack, which is how much it cost you to make that amount of money.

[07:54] What you got to spend to get it.

[07:56] And then this happens within the context of payback period, which is how quickly can you recover the cash that you spent

[08:02] before you can make that money.

[08:04] Because this is going to ultimately be the cash flow controlling of the business.

[08:07] As much as these are the two things that matter on paper, which is, you know,

[08:10] what does it cost you to make the money that you're going to make?

[08:12] Time is obviously huge component of business because cash flow happens over a period of time.

[08:17] All three of these things.

[08:19] Number one, number two, and number three payback period are all negatively impacted when you have the wrong customer.

[08:25] Because from an LTV perspective, you're going to have operational strain.

[08:29] You're going to have to increase your cost basis to deliver for these customers because they cost so much.

[08:35] And on top of that, you're going to have price compression because there's always going to be some who's willing to serve this customer for cheaper

[08:41] who knows less about business than you.

[08:43] You're always going to have people, they're going to be price comparing you.

[08:45] They're going to say, hey, this guy down the street can do it for less.

[08:48] And because they're unsophisticated, they might go to that person, even though that person might have terrible delivery.

[08:53] And they're just going to put all of their crazy expectations on this other person.

[08:56] You have cost that go up because they're super demanding.

[08:58] Price pressure on the way down, which leaves very little here.

[09:01] But on top of that, your team will route typically continues to suffer because the team gets burned out from this revolving door of customers.

[09:08] Where they never feel like they can really make an impact because they feel like all they're doing is onboarding and offboarding, onboarding and offboarding.

[09:14] And onboarding the beginning with people at which many expectations and offboarding at the end when the people are very upset.

[09:19] And all they feel like there are just lots of customer service, lots of fires.

[09:23] Here's the real rule that people don't talk about, which is that you also have the opportunity cost here, which is what could you achieve with the right customers, right?

[09:31] Like what could this look like if you had the best customers?

[09:33] So I'll talk about in a second.

[09:35] So we have morale, we have ops that hits in terms of costs, and then we have price.

[09:40] But on top of that, this is where it's even more net.

[09:43] You're like, I thought that was enough for instance to not do it.

[09:45] Let me give you another one.

[09:46] Is that your reputation is going to suffer?

[09:49] Because in the beginning you're going to be able to sell customers because you're promising more than anybody else does.

[09:53] And you're doing it as a reasonable price.

[09:55] And so you'll have a lot of flock of customers in the beginning.

[09:57] But what's going to happen?

[09:58] One is the first people are going to sell people who know you might try a little bit harder.

[10:01] But as soon as you get into the mass market, based on the results you get for the first customers,

[10:05] all of a sudden these colder customers don't trust you as much.

[10:08] They're far more fickle.

[10:09] And they will then trash your reputation because you didn't save their business.

[10:13] Because what they're really looking for is a savior.

[10:15] And I promise you, you never want to sell to somebody who wants you to be their savior.

[10:19] Only you can save yourself and that goes for them too.

[10:22] What you'll know from a red flag perspective is that your cost to a car customers will continue to rise disproportionately from the cost of CPMs going.

[10:32] I mean, the cost per thousand eyeballs.

[10:35] If the ad platforms haven't doubled their rates for CPMs, which they typically don't over any kind of period of time,

[10:41] that's like a year or two.

[10:43] And your cost to a car customers have doubled.

[10:45] Then usually you have this invisible hand that's working against you.

[10:49] Many people believe in the power of word of mouth, but some reason, people don't believe in the power of word of mouth when it comes to negative.

[10:55] Of course, word of mouth affects you, negative.

[10:58] It actually usually 5 or 10 times more potent on the negative side because negative news spreads far faster.

[11:04] People tell far more people about their bad experiences than their good ones.

[11:07] If your cost continue to rise in terms of getting customers,

[11:10] your margins continue to compress, it's because of this effect that bad customers have on your business.

[11:15] But wait, there's more.

[11:16] Not only is our LTV suck and it's a miserable existence to have.

[11:19] We have price pressure, operational pressure, team morale sucks, reputation,

[11:22] nicks ahead.

[11:23] Cost to a car customers continue to rise over time.

[11:25] Also, our payback period increases because you're making less per customer on LTV in terms of gross profit.

[11:32] And it's costing you more to get them.

[11:34] That means that extends out how long it takes you to recover the cost of getting the customer to get the next one.

[11:40] Something called your cash conversion cycle, how quickly you can return the cash to the business so you can continue to expand,

[11:45] increases in duration, meaning it takes way longer to get that money back.

[11:49] And all of a sudden, it's even harder to scale, which means growth gets limited.

[11:55] Your business stops scaling.

[11:58] So, quick recap.

[12:01] We talked about what this problem is and what it looks like.

[12:04] We talked about why it matters and why it's going to impact the actual dollars and cents of the business.

[12:08] So, if you're listening to a longer, like, okay, I feel like Alex is telling me my life story right now.

[12:12] And if this sounds so familiar to you, I do not say this from a pulpit.

[12:15] I say this is somebody who has been through it.

[12:17] And I know these pains so personally because I did it.

[12:20] And I made this mistake, so just please don't do this.

[12:23] But when you are like, okay, this is me.

[12:26] The doctor's reading my symptoms.

[12:27] What's the cure?

[12:28] What's the solution?

[12:29] Well, let's get into it.

[12:31] So, if any of this sounded very familiar to you,

[12:33] what I was describing is some of the problems that happened around stage four, which is prioritized.

[12:37] So, this is where you first have kind of like your first team, you operate as a manager.

[12:41] Typically, you have maybe five to ten employees, sometimes contractors who are helping you out.

[12:46] And if you're looking at this, it's like, what are the constraints here?

[12:48] It's like, you're getting too many unqualified leads.

[12:50] So, you have to make better free stuff and more creative to book volume.

[12:53] You have to add qualifications and friction.

[12:55] So, the extra volume becomes self-selective.

[12:57] This is the whole, like, we have to say no to people.

[12:59] We have to specialize our product, and we have to price to serve this now new niche down avatar.

[13:04] Now, when we say niche down, it could be nicheed up to be clear.

[13:07] I'm just saying we're being narrower about the customer.

[13:09] But if any of these things sound familiar and you'd like to know, man,

[13:12] I wonder what other problems I'm going to be dealing with in the business.

[13:14] This is from the $100 million scaling roadmap, which my team and I spent so many hours putting together.

[13:19] Because when we looked at businesses as they scale,

[13:21] there's clear problems and clear solutions at every stage of scaling.

[13:25] And so, if you want to know what stage you're at, and obviously what to do next,

[13:28] you can go Acquis.com.4 slash roadmap, and you get this whole thing for free.

[13:31] Just enter a business information and you'll split it out.

[13:33] If you want my team to help you figure out what basically take this and then get really narrow on your industry.

[13:40] Where you're at right now in the business, I'd love to invite you out to one of our workshops.

[13:43] We hold the monthly, add a headquarters here in Vegas.

[13:45] On the thank you page, you can book call.

[13:47] We'd love to help you out.

[13:48] It's on a see like, it's very, very fulfilling for me.

[13:51] And ultimately, us continuing to do with businesses is how I continue to make this content interesting

[13:55] because I can see the problems that people are dealing with on a regular basis.

[13:58] So that being said, get your free thing, book call in the next page,

[14:01] and otherwise, let's enjoy the rest of the video.

[14:03] How to fix it.

[14:05] Okay.

[14:06] The first part about fixing it is realizing why this is so hard to begin with.

[14:10] Emotionally, it's so difficult because you're in this rock and a hard place because you do have bills.

[14:14] You do have payroll.

[14:15] And you probably expanded your team because you learned how to market and sell,

[14:19] but these customers suck.

[14:21] You had to get more and more head count to support all these customers,

[14:23] but now that you have this head count, you have to keep selling every single month,

[14:26] or you're going to quote, lose your business or you're going to have to lay people off,

[14:29] which is going to suck and to be a hard decision for you.

[14:31] But the other situation is that you stay in this very miserable land,

[14:34] where your margins continue to compress and continue to be volatile over time,

[14:37] until eventually there's nothing left in the business,

[14:39] and ultimately you've kind of driven yourself out of business.

[14:41] I would encourage you to not get to that point,

[14:43] and if you are at that point, then now's the time to act,

[14:46] which is that you have to pick a better customer.

[14:48] The reason you want to pick a better customer is that all of the things that we're negative before,

[14:52] over here, get reversed.

[14:54] So your LTV is going to go up.

[14:56] Your cac might also go up, but your LTV to cac ratio will ultimately go down.

[15:00] You start to have a better reputation because you only go up market.

[15:03] That guy only serves legit people.

[15:05] Obviously, you start associating with these bigger businesses

[15:07] because you're also become a bigger business.

[15:09] Your team and your morale is going to improve because they also are dealing with more legitimate business owners,

[15:13] or legitimate customers.

[15:14] And then on top of that, these people can pay their bills,

[15:16] and they stick with their commitments.

[15:17] You're going to have better cash for it to get you freed up.

[15:19] Which's very interesting about this is that you can often make more money

[15:23] taking your service that was once $500 of cost to you,

[15:26] and making $1,000 of cost to you,

[15:28] but selling something for three or four times is expensive.

[15:31] And that happens all the time.

[15:33] Rather than trying to drive like, okay, you know, $500,

[15:36] and we're going to charge $1,000, it's like nomin,

[15:38] maybe a cost you $1,000, but charge 10, or charge 7.

[15:41] You're going to make way more money,

[15:43] but absolute and relatively by selling to a customer,

[15:45] and customer can afford that, because they're going to actually be able to get the value.

[15:48] Because fundamentally, the whole point of business is to think,

[15:51] what customer can provide the absolute most of I2?

[15:54] That's the person you sell to.

[15:55] That is how you make an exceptional business.

[15:57] I'll just give you the quick hit or list of the kind of the pains that you're going through,

[16:00] and then we'll talk about the solution.

[16:01] One is you're going to have the emotional pain of overhigh,

[16:03] and you're going to have to deal with that.

[16:04] Number two is you're going to have the uncertainty of whether this path is going to work to make this transition,

[16:08] but you know your current one is only getting you worse and worse,

[16:11] so either writing on the wall.

[16:12] Number three is that you have some sort of emotional attachment to your level of revenue today.

[16:16] You know, I don't want to go from $200,000 to $100,000 to $100,000,

[16:18] I don't want to go from $50,000 to $20,000 a month,

[16:21] or whatever your revenue is, add a subtract here, zero is as possible,

[16:25] it happens at any level.

[16:26] You have this ego attachment to this level,

[16:28] but it means nothing.

[16:29] Would you rather get to your goal in five years?

[16:32] Would you rather get to your goal never?

[16:34] Sometimes the fastest way to build a 10 million dollar business

[16:38] is not the fastest way to build a one million dollar business.

[16:41] Because of that, you have to build a different foundation of ponwich to build your building.

[16:45] If you look at every great entrepreneur, they've been willing to go backwards.

[16:48] So sometimes you reach something called a local maximum.

[16:51] You climb this hill here, and you're like, why can't I go any further than this?

[16:55] Sometimes you have to go down in order to go back up.

[16:58] You have these local maxes where you think you've climbed the mountain,

[17:01] but then the clouds disappear, and then you realize because you see the world more clearly,

[17:05] oh my god, this is actually the top,

[17:07] but I don't want to go from 100k down to 50k.

[17:11] I don't want to do that because it would hurt my ego.

[17:13] Well, a lot of entrepreneurship is the ego death of realizing that you will inevitably get things wrong more times than you get them right.

[17:19] But the thing that keeps you down is never being willing to admit that.

[17:23] Because here's the thing that no one tells you,

[17:25] is that if you don't change, you're going to get to 50k no matter what anyways.

[17:28] See, my eyes will do it on your own,

[17:30] and actually do it in a purposeful way so you can get to where you're trying to go.

[17:33] Because the business is just going to compress over time anyways.

[17:35] One of my big kind of rules in life is that if I know something has to happen eventually,

[17:38] I might as well do it today.

[17:40] It's one of my big rules.

[17:41] Because it maybe it's my own agency ego or whatever.

[17:44] It's like, if anybody's going to destroy my business, it's going to be me.

[17:47] It's like, I would have put me out of business.

[17:49] You probably heard this before.

[17:50] You want to put yourself out of business.

[17:51] I don't want the world to put me out of business.

[17:53] I don't want the market to put me out of business.

[17:54] I want to read the writing on the wall before it happens.

[17:56] I want to ski to where the puck's going, not where the puck is.

[17:58] So, what are you going to do about it?

[18:02] So, this is super tactical, but this is actually how you fix this.

[18:06] So, number one is you're going to conduct a customer profitability analysis.

[18:09] So, the way it works is this.

[18:10] You look at all the customers that you've had today.

[18:13] You probably have some customers that you actually like and that you actually have gotten good results for it.

[18:18] Now, what you want to look at here is demographics.

[18:21] So, this is who are these people?

[18:24] What did they come in?

[18:25] Like, what do they look like?

[18:27] Right? Like, what do they look like?

[18:28] How do they behave? What are their psychographics?

[18:30] What are they doing currently?

[18:33] So, do they have certain headcount?

[18:35] Do they have certain revenue levels?

[18:36] Is there anything else that we can say that has nothing to do with their demographics,

[18:39] but everything you're a bit there behaviors?

[18:41] And then finally, you have done, right?

[18:44] Which is what actions did they take as a result of entering my business

[18:47] that are different than the results of the people who didn't take those actions?

[18:50] Said differently.

[18:51] If we've got lots of customers that we've been selling,

[18:53] maybe there's a revenue level.

[18:55] Maybe there's a certain amount of weight they have to lose.

[18:57] Maybe there's certain emotional problem that they're dealing with.

[18:59] It's like, you know how did really well with female divorce days over 45?

[19:02] Fine, whatever it is.

[19:03] And they are making over X, Y, and Z.

[19:06] And when they entered my business, they immediately got on their first call

[19:09] and started to crash die in the first seven days.

[19:11] I'm making this up.

[19:12] The point is, is that we have who they are,

[19:14] what they're doing when they're coming in,

[19:16] and then what they did as a result of our product or service

[19:18] in order to maximize value.

[19:20] These are the steps here.

[19:22] So, we do this to try and say,

[19:23] Oh, you know what?

[19:24] What is the 80, 20 of my business?

[19:26] If I could cut an only clone one specific type of customer,

[19:30] what would they be?

[19:31] Now, you might hear this and be like,

[19:32] yeah, that's convenient,

[19:33] but I have to pay bills.

[19:35] I'm telling you, sometimes you have to walk down the mountain

[19:38] to walk it back up because here's the crazy part.

[19:40] The amount of times I'll talk to a business owner and they're like,

[19:43] you know what?

[19:44] I would service these customers,

[19:45] except they just don't pay enough.

[19:47] Then you can just say,

[19:48] guess who gets to pick what your prices are?

[19:51] You do.

[19:52] If there's a price where it's worth it to you,

[19:54] charge that.

[19:55] And if someone doesn't want to pay it,

[19:56] fine.

[19:57] It's capitalism.

[19:58] It's volunteer exchange.

[19:59] So, once we know who they are,

[20:01] what they're doing when they're coming in,

[20:03] and then what they have done in order to be successful,

[20:05] we then redefine our new customer profile.

[20:08] Some people have this,

[20:09] it's an ICP,

[20:10] which is an ideal customer profile.

[20:11] Some people have your customer avatar.

[20:12] I don't really care what you call it.

[20:13] It's the person you want to be selling.

[20:14] Once we have this new ICP,

[20:16] this ideal customer profile,

[20:18] we now have to basically do everything top to bottom

[20:20] and realign the business

[20:22] in positioning and messaging.

[20:25] So, what that means is,

[20:26] your offer has to match that type of customer.

[20:28] Your headline has to match that type of customer.

[20:30] The testimonials you show should be those types of customers.

[20:32] The onboarding experience should be for those types of customers.

[20:35] Your sales team should not be allowed to sell people

[20:37] who are not this type of customer.

[20:39] You have to be willing to say,

[20:40] notice small money today to make big money tomorrow.

[20:43] That means that you have to implement

[20:45] some sort of qualification process.

[20:47] Yes, you have to say,

[20:48] no to customers.

[20:49] Do you think you can go to Olga Vee and Mathers?

[20:51] One of the biggest marketing agencies in the world.

[20:53] If you're a local dry cleaner?

[20:55] No.

[20:56] You can't.

[20:57] They won't take you.

[20:58] They won't accept you as a customer.

[21:00] One of the telltale signs of a small business

[21:02] that stay stuck is they see yes to everyone.

[21:04] You didn't know any better.

[21:05] Continue to grow this business.

[21:06] We do everything for everyone.

[21:07] And then you're surprised about the fact that you're

[21:09] marching stuck and it's very hard to operationalize this business.

[21:11] And you have a hundred of other problems that you think exist.

[21:13] When the reality is that you just haven't decided

[21:16] who you're going to serve.

[21:18] You're like, okay, I get it, Alex.

[21:20] I'm going to go do this customer research report and figure out

[21:23] who are the people who are the best customers.

[21:25] I'm going to say these are my new customers from here and out.

[21:27] I'm going to match all my messaging and my phone is my

[21:29] offers my price points key point because if you only sold

[21:32] to that top 20 percent, what would your new price be?

[21:35] Probably way higher.

[21:37] Why?

[21:38] Because you can provide more value to those people.

[21:39] So you instead of having this lukewarm price

[21:41] where it's like cheap for the good customers and

[21:43] expensive for the bad ones, just making it appropriately

[21:46] priced for the people who are going to get the most value.

[21:49] And then make sure that you only sell to those people.

[21:52] That's the qualification.

[21:53] Once you have this, what do you do to get from where you're at now

[21:56] on this little peak here to over here?

[21:58] All right, to the top bar little mountain.

[22:00] Well, you have to transition.

[22:02] All right, you have to transition away from the alpha customers.

[22:04] Now, what that's going to mean is that you're going to

[22:07] number five, stop selling brokies.

[22:11] And that may mean that you have to put a cap in the short term,

[22:14] which is like we can only sell 30 percent of customers

[22:17] below this amount.

[22:18] Maybe each sales guy gets a quota of like,

[22:20] give me is the variable to sell in order to hit whatever your monthly

[22:23] cash flows.

[22:24] If you make this transition correctly, the people who are paying

[22:26] more and are better customers will be more profitable.

[22:28] They will stay longer.

[22:29] And then you are able to basically do one of these.

[22:31] And you're going to decrease the percentage of the pie that's these.

[22:33] Bad customers increase the percentage of the pie that's the 20 percent.

[22:36] And then over time, the 20 percent becomes the 80 percent.

[22:39] And then at some point, and you'll know that point because

[22:41] you're going to be so happy to do it, you're going to stop selling

[22:44] that negative percentage of customers all together.

[22:46] And once that happens, you will have transitioned from your very painful

[22:51] business and maybe have taken a half step back in terms of revenue

[22:54] because you have to tighten the ship up.

[22:56] Now this may mean that you might have to lay off some people.

[23:00] And as terrible as it is, it's reality.

[23:03] Here's a very tough line, which is you made a mistake.

[23:06] And you should get fired as CEO or founder from your business.

[23:10] But you can't get fired.

[23:11] And so it means that someone else is ultimately going to have to pay the burden.

[23:14] You have to take this, what you will have is you'll start to have a healthy

[23:17] respect for hiring people because it shakes their lives.

[23:21] They change cities sometimes.

[23:23] They change professions.

[23:24] They go for periods of time with their unemployed.

[23:26] If you have to make this mistake, it should become far more

[23:29] respectful of the process.

[23:31] But in the beginning, you don't know anything.

[23:32] So you just hire all your friends and your family.

[23:34] You just say, let's go, let's go.

[23:35] We're scaling like crazy, but you don't know what you're doing.

[23:37] So you're going to quickly hit this wall.

[23:38] And you're going to quickly realize that you built a terrible business.

[23:41] But you can either just say you're going to stay there because you're unwilling to have this

[23:46] uncomfortable conversation or what I would recommend doing.

[23:49] Give them a little bit of severance.

[23:51] All right, so give them some money saying, hey, I mess this up.

[23:54] So instead of me taking money out this month, I'm going to give you some money.

[23:56] So you can have two weeks or four weeks or whatever it is.

[23:58] If you're a smaller, I understand that that's a lot.

[24:00] The bigger the biggest it the business is.

[24:02] Typically the longer that severance parents will be, that you're able to pay.

[24:05] That also saves your reputation from business and from perspective, which yes,

[24:09] that matters.

[24:10] But when you make those changes, you just have to take absolute responsibility.

[24:14] I've been through this process many times with companies.

[24:17] And you just have to be like, I've fucked up.

[24:19] It's on me.

[24:20] I feel horrible this blows.

[24:23] But there's nothing else that I can do because ultimately I have to keep the ship afloat.

[24:28] So that maybe in six months or 12 months, maybe I can re-hier you.

[24:32] And I've had so many times where we've had, I would say, what a friendly exit.

[24:36] Where when I reach out to that person and when we do have that opportunity again,

[24:39] because you've fixed the core problem is a lot of them are willing to come back.

[24:42] If you kind of leave the door open rather than slamming it shut, you'll also maintain better

[24:46] long-term relationships.

[24:47] Those people are willing to do some contract with for you on the side.

[24:50] And then maybe long-term and things is like, guys, especially if you're getting into business business

[24:54] is long, life is long.

[24:55] I have people who work for me many, many years ago and then they come back.

[24:59] Many years later, they go through a whole another chapter and then they come back with a whole bunch of new skills,

[25:03] which is great.

[25:04] But the things is if you slam the door in their face, you never get the opportunity to get it.

[25:07] I would rather always leave with, and especially if it's something that's involuntary,

[25:11] it's like they didn't do anything wrong.

[25:12] You did something wrong and that result of your mistake is that they have to look at let go.

[25:16] And if you're like, I just can't do that.

[25:18] Well, then you are ultimately choosing to do them everyone.

[25:21] Unlike the Hollywood movies where like you can't save everyone, that's not the real world.

[25:25] The real world is like sometimes when you play chess, you have to sacrifice pawns.

[25:29] There's not a single chess master that I know of.

[25:33] Who is everyone a game without losing any at the highest levels?

[25:36] It just doesn't happen.

[25:37] It doesn't work.

[25:38] You have to be able to pivot and make mistakes.

[25:41] Otherwise you lose the whole game.

[25:42] And then everyone loses their job including you.

[25:44] You want to have a shot at tomorrow.

[25:46] Sometimes you have to make the hard decisions today.

[25:48] So when you make this transition correctly, what will happen is you will begin to grow again.

[25:53] And you will be able to grow because you will have more cash flow because you are serving better customers

[25:58] and the main points that they will continue to stay.

[26:00] This point, if you've got in this area where you're selling these back customers, you know how to market, you know how to sell it at a basic level.

[26:05] You know how to get people in the door.

[26:06] The problem is that your business is caps because you have more people leaving than you have coming in.

[26:11] But if all of a sudden you're an element of people who leave goes to zero or goes to very, very small numbers, you grow pretty much no matter what.

[26:18] That's ultimately what you want to solve for.

[26:20] It's how do I sell something that people don't want to cancel out of.

[26:22] And sometimes the way that you do that is you change who you're selling to.

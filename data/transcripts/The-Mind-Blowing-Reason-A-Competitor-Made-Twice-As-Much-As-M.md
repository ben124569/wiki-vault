[00:00] So I was 24 and I was running ads in my space and I was getting 15 to 21 returns in a

[00:09] local market and I've been doing this for like a year at this point. So I was like, I felt

[00:12] pretty good about myself. And then there's this competitor who moved into my area and somehow we

[00:19] hopped on the phone and he was just killing it. He was just killing it. He was doing it like he was

[00:24] selling more people than we were and I was like, what the fuck is this guy doing? Right? And he told

[00:28] me that he was converting how many percent of his leads is converting and I was converting

[00:31] two and a half times more leads than he was. Like I was he was converting 10 percent. I was converting

[00:36] 25 percent of my leads. Like I was killing it. But I was like what the fuck? How is this even possible? And

[00:41] I was spending a hundred dollars a day and he was spending five hundred dollars a day and he would spend

[00:48] 15,000 and he would make 60 and keep 45 and I would spend three and make you know, whatever,

[00:56] 25 or whatever it was and I you know, I was making 22 and he was making twice as much money as

[01:03] me even though you're spending five times as much. And that's when I was like, wait none of the

[01:08] shit matters. Like it's just about who makes the most money. And so at some point you're going to like

[01:14] just everyone, all your shit will get less effective. I'm just telling you like it will be less

[01:18] excuse me, less efficient in terms of spend but that's part of scaling.

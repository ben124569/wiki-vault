[00:00] There's four ways to buy anything,

[00:01] and I'll show you one unique way

[00:02] that's what actually got me this building.

[00:03] And so let me walk you through it.

[00:05] You've got what I would consider past money,

[00:08] so that would be savings.

[00:09] So that's earnings that you had in the past,

[00:11] and that's money that you put away.

[00:14] The next money is you have income money.

[00:17] So this is the money that you make every single month.

[00:19] You can spend this money rather than touching your savings.

[00:22] This makes sense.

[00:23] Then you've got debt money,

[00:26] which is basically future earnings.

[00:28] Like this is money,

[00:29] I'm gonna take debt,

[00:30] and I'm gonna pay with future money, right?

[00:32] And I'm gonna have to pay this debt off.

[00:34] And then finally,

[00:36] is the category that I like to have,

[00:38] which is, and I'll call it new money.

[00:40] Now you're like, what is that even me?

[00:42] That's what I'll explain.

[00:43] So I've noticed amongst the friends

[00:45] that I have that are the best with money,

[00:46] that they're wealthiest with money.

[00:47] They're okay buying things that are big grandiose, right?

[00:52] Now some of them buy big houses,

[00:53] some of them big buy big cars,

[00:54] some buy big yachts, big buildings, whatever it is, right?

[00:58] And I had a business owner who came here

[01:00] and he was like, hey, I'm choosing between two offices,

[01:02] I've got basically a sensible office,

[01:04] and I've got a much bigger office

[01:05] that I'm really excited about.

[01:06] He said, which one do you think I should take?

[01:08] And I said, which one do you want?

[01:09] And he said the big one.

[01:10] And this guy was a very good salesman.

[01:12] And I said, okay, here's the deal.

[01:14] You can buy the big one.

[01:15] It was two and a half times a size.

[01:17] I at least two and a half times the price,

[01:18] and it was a little bit nicer, whatever.

[01:20] As if the deal is, you got to pay it off any year.

[01:24] He was like, I can do that.

[01:25] And I was like, right, then don't worry about it.

[01:28] And so the thing is is that I would say,

[01:29] these are kind of almost a different personality types

[01:32] in terms of where people are taking the money from.

[01:34] Now the reason that I've bring up this building,

[01:35] being a significant purchase,

[01:37] is it was less that the price was

[01:39] a significant purchase, and more so,

[01:41] that I didn't need this building at the time.

[01:45] I just wanted to have a place to have a home gym,

[01:47] that would be more than like,

[01:48] it'd be like a commercial gym,

[01:50] and I wanted to have place for meetups and things like that.

[01:52] And I could come up with a rational explanation

[01:54] that between all the portfolio companies,

[01:55] we were spending about $4 million a year

[01:57] in event spaces.

[01:58] And I was like, well, if I had a big enough space

[02:00] for all of them to do their internal meetings,

[02:02] their quarterlys, fly out their staff and their team

[02:04] and have a venue, then I could probably save that

[02:06] and pay for the building.

[02:08] But I remember Layla was like, hey, we should just get

[02:12] like a $5,000 square foot building.

[02:14] So this building's about $36,000 square feet, much bigger.

[02:17] And I remember hearing this, and I was like,

[02:19] I mean, that's a appropriately sized for where we're at now.

[02:22] But it's not the size building that I would want it to be

[02:27] for where I want to go.

[02:28] And so I remember telling her, I said,

[02:30] I promise if we buy this building, I will make sure

[02:33] that it makes us more money than it has cost us.

[02:36] And I would say that a behavior that has served me

[02:38] extraordinarily well is looking at new money.

[02:41] Meaning, if I buy this building, can I find something

[02:45] that will pay off the building?

[02:46] Now, of course, I had the expenses on the portfolio side.

[02:49] We could have just saved the $4 million a year

[02:50] that we spend in venues and all that stuff.

[02:52] Sure.

[02:53] But I was like, is I'll bet you

[02:56] there's something that we can do with our existing resources.

[02:58] And this is the key part, is that it's saw dust money.

[03:02] It's money using your existing resources

[03:05] that you're currently underutilizing

[03:07] to generate new money for a specific project.

[03:10] And so my favorite way of doing this is like,

[03:12] hey, if Daniel wants to buy a boat or wants to buy a car,

[03:15] I love the idea of him being like,

[03:17] so I'm just going to work one extra day per week

[03:20] over the next year, and then I'm going to buy it.

[03:23] The richest people I know, that is the

[03:25] behavior that they typically use.

[03:28] I want this thing, and so I'm going to go make the money

[03:31] to buy the thing.

[03:32] I'm not going to use my existing income.

[03:34] I'm not going to use my existing resources.

[03:35] I'm not going to use my savings to buy it.

[03:38] I'm not going to go into debt unless I know that I'm going

[03:41] to pay it off of the new year, and I have no prepaid

[03:43] with penalty, and I have a clear plan of how I'm going to do it.

[03:45] They have a clear plan of how they're going to make the money

[03:47] and a very defined time period.

[03:49] And it's from doing above and beyond.

[03:51] It's looking at all the stuff you got.

[03:53] And the reason that I like this is I was talking to a good

[03:56] friend of mine, Sharan, Savata.

[03:59] He's a president of real.

[04:01] Actually, he just became a board member.

[04:02] She's me.

[04:03] And he said, oh, he said, you just want to write yourself

[04:07] a swimming pool.

[04:08] And I was like, what does that mean?

[04:10] He said, so Paul McCartney, the Beatles, used to say he

[04:14] wanted a swimming pool.

[04:15] And everyone's like, well, how are you going to pay for it?

[04:19] Now, obviously, he has the money for a swimming pool.

[04:22] But he didn't want to use his savings.

[04:23] He didn't want to use his income in his royalties.

[04:25] He didn't want to go into debt for it.

[04:27] And so what he do?

[04:28] He was like, I'm just going to go write a song.

[04:30] And so he writes a song, and he writes himself a swimming pool

[04:34] from the money that he collects from songs, right?

[04:36] And so I think about this a lot, because I think it's

[04:40] a different way if thinking about money.

[04:41] It's like, I want this thing.

[04:43] It's not going to limit that thing.

[04:45] If anything, I want to use that thing to motivate me

[04:47] to find other resources.

[04:49] So what I'm being is resourceful, rather than draining

[04:52] resources, I have, I'm finding new resources by utilizing

[04:55] existing assets that are currently under my control.

[04:58] And so this is fundamentally like people like, well, you

[05:00] could Airbnb one of the rooms out.

[05:01] And I'm like, OK, that's one of the things I'm going to do.

[05:03] But I also have some time.

[05:05] So it's like, maybe I'll drive Uber.

[05:06] There was one of my favorite customers ever at my gym.

[05:08] She was a mom of four, single mom.

[05:10] She didn't have the money for the gym membership.

[05:13] And she was like, well, I could drive Uber one day.

[05:17] We can that.

[05:17] I would be able to afford it.

[05:18] And I was like, great.

[05:19] And do that.

[05:20] And so that's what she did.

[05:21] And choose one on longstanding members, lost 100 pounds.

[05:23] And it's like, there's a shift that happens when

[05:26] you decide to do it that way.

[05:27] And I think there's something to be said about creating

[05:29] a vacuum, about creating space.

[05:32] I've heard of saying, like, make yourself poor.

[05:34] Of the idea of, how do I create this deprivation?

[05:37] How do I create this threshold that all of a sudden

[05:40] increases my demand for money?

[05:44] Because everybody has a demand for money.

[05:46] Like you have a certain lifestyle that you have grown accustomed to.

[05:49] And so that's your minimum threshold.

[05:51] That's your minimum requirement for living.

[05:53] The real wealth comes from being able to continue to jack this up

[05:56] while keeping this low, of course.

[05:59] But in those instances, when you do want to buy the sweet ride,

[06:02] because I'm not, like, people think of me as an aesthetic.

[06:06] And I am too allergic to great.

[06:07] But if I want to buy a sick ass home gym, which I do have,

[06:12] I would rather that money come from new stuff.

[06:15] Either you can do extra stuff to get the thing.

[06:18] Or I think the 201 version of this is, how do I use the thing

[06:22] to make even more money?

[06:23] And so part of the reason we spun up the advisory services

[06:26] was actually like me fulfilling a promise to Layla of, like,

[06:29] OK, well, find a way to use the building to generate income

[06:32] to cover the building.

[06:33] Because I do want to have the sick home gym,

[06:34] which will be a complete and other ways to space.

[06:37] Besides the fact that I think it's dope and why

[06:38] have money if you can't spend it.

[06:40] And you can't take it with you anyways.

[06:42] And so this may seem like a wild departure

[06:44] from some of the content that I make.

[06:45] But this is obviously targeted.

[06:47] So many probably has a little bit more,

[06:48] a little bit further along.

[06:49] If you're a broke, don't do that.

[06:51] If you're broke, just focus on the new money stuff.

[06:54] But if you have some, I think that you

[06:56] stay ahead of your spending by not increasing your lifestyle

[07:00] relative to your income.

[07:01] But by increasing the new money, relative to the new purchase,

[07:04] which typically are defined.

[07:06] And so it doesn't have to be forever.

[07:08] So if you're like, why don't we work over time all the time?

[07:09] Fine.

[07:10] Then you can just work over time for a year,

[07:11] work over time for six months, work over time for a month,

[07:14] so that you can afford the thing.

[07:15] And I think it's always, when you think about it like that,

[07:17] is I have to add this on top.

[07:19] I don't touch my flows.

[07:21] I don't touch my income flow.

[07:22] And I don't want to create a liability with the debt.

[07:24] And savings is like, that's my nut.

[07:27] I don't want to use up my nesting.

[07:30] So I got to go make it.

[07:31] And this has just been this behavior that I have observed

[07:34] from the people that I know that are the wealthiest.

[07:37] And the people who enjoy their money the most.

[07:40] And I think that's the thing.

[07:41] It's like, it's one thing to have money.

[07:43] Because I know it's plenty of people who obviously have money.

[07:46] But some of them, I don't think they enjoy their money.

[07:48] And it's because they're always afraid.

[07:51] And there's some of this whole idea of like,

[07:52] you have to be abundant in all that stuff.

[07:53] I know it's not to be worse.

[07:54] Super scarcity mindset never let them money.

[07:56] Because they just don't like spending it.

[07:57] And so like, there's something we set for that.

[07:58] But that's if you make money the goal.

[08:00] And if you make money the goal, then buy them means

[08:01] don't spend it.

[08:02] Because then money is the goal.

[08:03] So fine.

[08:03] But if money isn't your goal, then the people that I've seen

[08:07] that are the happiest that I think spend money well,

[08:09] they use money like a tool.

[08:11] It is they use an expense or use something

[08:14] that they know they're going to consume.

[08:15] They know it's not a good investment.

[08:17] And they say fine, I know it's not a good investment.

[08:19] So I'm not going to use my income to buy it.

[08:21] I'm going to use something that I already

[08:24] have that I'm underutilizing, which might be just your time.

[08:26] You might take on a new client project.

[08:28] You might take on some 101 services

[08:30] that you wouldn't normally take on.

[08:32] Those types of things can be defined period.

[08:33] Because you're like, well, it's not going to increase

[08:34] the enterprise value.

[08:35] The business is not going to be some sellable asset.

[08:37] But I do want this thing.

[08:38] And I don't want to touch how my existing infrastructure

[08:41] functions.

[08:42] It's just one behavior.

[08:44] And I think many of you, like, if you're like me,

[08:47] like, I don't like spending money.

[08:49] And I've tried to learn my way out of it, which is,

[08:51] I don't like spending money that's my main money.

[08:54] It's like my core money.

[08:55] It's the money comes in from businesses, distributions.

[08:57] That's my main thing.

[08:59] But if I want to buy something crazy,

[09:01] then I'm just got to be willing to do something crazy for it.

[09:03] And the weirdest thing happens is that I get almost

[09:05] more excited about making that money.

[09:08] Then the money that I make every single day,

[09:10] because I know that that money is going to the towards the

[09:12] specific thing.

[09:13] So I'm building a home gym right now.

[09:15] I'm buying equipment right now.

[09:16] Like that's my, as I'm doing this,

[09:18] I'm almost like more joyful about doing the work.

[09:20] Because I know exactly what it's going towards.

[09:22] And so just a little behavior that I picked up over the year

[09:25] is something that I've observed and other people

[09:27] that I've used myself that has been wildly valuable.

[09:29] And if you have that, you've got two machines

[09:32] that you could buy for your business.

[09:33] And once a little bit sweeter than the other.

[09:35] And you can't really justify the expense,

[09:37] then just take the Delta, be like,

[09:38] I'm going to make that myself because I think it's sicker.

[09:40] And I have never been disappointed about doing that.

[09:42] Not once have I done that and been like,

[09:44] this was a mistake.

[09:45] And the thing is, is that I've got plenty of things

[09:47] that I think were expensive, right?

[09:50] But I can minimize my rep by saying,

[09:52] I'm not using money that I otherwise

[09:54] want to use somewhere else.

[09:56] And so that's my little money behavior

[09:58] that it served me very well.

[09:59] And I hope it serves you well.

[10:00] And you feel like this one little framework,

[10:03] I have 28 frameworks that I teach in 22 minutes on how

[10:06] we program how to think about money and joy.

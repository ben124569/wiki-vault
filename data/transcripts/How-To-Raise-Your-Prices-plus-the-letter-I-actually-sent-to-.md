[00:00] What's going on everyone in this video?

[00:01] I'm going to show you how to raise your prices

[00:03] in a tactical way on your existing customers.

[00:05] So it's one thing to raise your prices on new customers,

[00:08] which for many times, that's something that you have to do

[00:11] because you need to, you want to reinvest in,

[00:13] making the business better, you want to cover some capital expenses,

[00:16] or you just want to make more money.

[00:18] Which is fine, the number one lever on making money

[00:20] is what you're pricing in.

[00:21] We've done this in thousands of businesses now,

[00:24] and there's a process that we go about this.

[00:26] Because if you raise only existing customers,

[00:28] it's be ready to have people be upset.

[00:31] But here's why this is so important.

[00:33] So let's say that your business runs at a 20% net margin,

[00:35] which is fine, right?

[00:36] Let's say that you just for numbers sake,

[00:38] you charge $100 a month.

[00:39] If you're running a 20% net margin

[00:41] and you're at $100 a month,

[00:42] a 20% increase in pricing would double your profit,

[00:45] a 50% increase in pricing,

[00:46] with three and a half extra profit.

[00:48] That's pretty good.

[00:50] If you double your price, you would six acts how much money you make.

[00:53] And so this is how big of a lever pricing is

[00:56] on how much profit you make.

[00:57] And so knowing how to raise your prices,

[00:59] obviously, would be something that'd be very important.

[01:01] So there is a right way and a wrong way to do it.

[01:03] So what I want to do is show you the right way,

[01:04] because the wrong way to do it is send an email

[01:06] and saying, hey, we're raising our prices, screw you.

[01:09] And you'll get a ton of customers who leave you

[01:11] and then you end up being worse off than you were before.

[01:13] But I did this in my facility.

[01:16] This is one of my first businesses,

[01:17] and I actually had a third of my customers cancel,

[01:20] but I tripled my price.

[01:22] And so I was able to keep two thirds of my customers

[01:24] at three times the price and lose one third of my biggest

[01:27] amount of money that I've got in my money,

[01:27] and I've got a lot of money that I've got in my money.

[01:29] So I've got a lot of money that I've got in my money.

[01:31] So I've got a lot of money that I've got in my money.

[01:33] So I've got a lot of money that I've got in my money.

[01:35] So I've got a lot of money that I've got in my money.

[01:37] So I've got a lot of money that I've got in my money.

[01:39] So I've got a lot of money that I've got in my money.

[01:41] So I've got a lot of money that I've got in my money.

[01:43] So I've got a lot of money that I've got in my money.

[01:45] So I've got a lot of money that I've got in my money.

[01:47] So I've got a lot of money that I've got in my money.

[01:49] And if you're curious, my Jimalt Seagre's book is a book that is about

[01:53] Jim's, but is a business book that is simply applied to Jim's.

[01:56] If you want it, you can grab it.

[01:57] It's not how I make money.

[01:59] But let's walk through this.

[02:01] So you have your letter to increased prices.

[02:04] Now, there's a format to doing this.

[02:06] Now, it's not about you.

[02:08] It's about the prospect.

[02:09] It's about the consumer.

[02:10] So the first thing that we want to do is we're going to say,

[02:13] hey, you've probably known that we've been growing a lot.

[02:16] You've probably noticed a lot of the good things that are going on.

[02:19] So that's why I'm writing this letter.

[02:21] So it's like, why am I doing this?

[02:23] Why am I writing this letter to you?

[02:24] What's the intention of the letter?

[02:26] The second is we're going to talk about what we currently are doing.

[02:30] So this is allowing you to resell them a little bit on what you're currently doing to

[02:35] value your currently providing them.

[02:36] Because sometimes they forget, because they might only use one aspect to your service.

[02:40] And so they're like, oh, wow, there's a lot of extra stuff that I didn't even know about.

[02:42] And believe me, I can't even tell you the amount of times people read this letter.

[02:45] They're like, I don't even know you're doing all this stuff.

[02:47] And so you want to list out the stuff that you're doing.

[02:49] They say, okay, we hire and retain the best talent.

[02:53] We offer continued education for our employees.

[02:56] We're providing new softwares and equipment to our members that we always try and keep

[03:02] up to date.

[03:03] That's what we're currently doing.

[03:04] I didn't even think about that.

[03:05] So the goal here is to get them to think about your costs.

[03:09] Try and get them into the mind of you as an entrepreneur, to the best of your ability.

[03:14] These are the things that we incur in order to provide this value.

[03:16] It's not like we're just taking all the money you give us and putting it in our pockets,

[03:20] because that's what everyone always thinks.

[03:22] The next thing we do is we're going to say, wow, despite all the stuff that we're doing,

[03:25] we want to do even more, because we're losing our minds, because we just provide crazy

[03:28] value.

[03:29] And so it's like, we want to, like, you know, we're currently a rag-tug bunch of champions,

[03:35] our facility, if you have an actual facility and if you're online, it's like, you know,

[03:39] we've had a lot of stuff that's duct taped together.

[03:40] We want to really level up the brand and we want to do it for you.

[03:44] Right?

[03:45] What's coming?

[03:46] So this is like we want to add these X, Y and Z things.

[03:49] We want to add, especially programs, we want to add higher levels of service.

[03:51] We want to add, you know, events to our, to our business.

[03:55] We want to add all these things, right?

[03:56] A massive improvement to our level of service.

[03:58] These are all things that we want to be adding, right?

[04:01] And then what I like to do is I like to tie this, tie this increase to a promise of values.

[04:08] Okay?

[04:09] Now, what I mean by that is, I want to tie this to values that I described to you

[04:14] that no one can contest.

[04:16] So I can say, I have made this promise to you and with integrity, I can no longer provide

[04:20] the level of service that I have promised unless we do these things.

[04:24] Because I will not stay in here in this marketplace and say that we are the best at XYZ

[04:29] unless we do these things.

[04:30] And the only way for me to do these things is for us to have a corresponding increase in

[04:33] price, right?

[04:34] Now, mind you, when you're communicating the price, it's also important to communicate

[04:38] the price in a way that's, you know, attractive.

[04:40] So you don't want to say, hey, it's going to cost you $5,000 extra year.

[04:43] You would say it'd be better to say it's going to cost you an extra $100 a week, right?

[04:47] Sounds like a lot less, right?

[04:49] You can break down even more.

[04:50] It's $15 a day.

[04:51] It depends on who we're talking to and what level of service you have.

[04:54] But you can break down to weekly or break down to daily.

[04:56] And that's why insurance quotes people in days, it's only a dollar a day, right?

[05:00] So that you can do this in it and it will minimize what the perceived cost is.

[05:04] So ideally, you want to maximize by saying, this is all the stuff we're doing that we

[05:08] you don't even know about.

[05:09] This is the stuff we want to do that's even more than that.

[05:11] And this is how little it's going to cost you.

[05:13] And the reason we must do this is so that I can maintain my integrity to you and the

[05:17] promise that I made you.

[05:19] I'm further that this is something I'm planning my flag here is that I demand to be the best

[05:23] in the marketplace.

[05:24] And for us to do this, we must continually invest in for us to do that.

[05:28] Like this is what is required, right?

[05:30] And then, and here's what's cool is that I like to add a little PS at the end.

[05:34] And that little PS is to give perspective, right?

[05:37] And what I do here is I say, if this is going to materially, if I'm going to do this,

[05:41] I'm going to take that to my next lecture life, if you're not going to be able to pay

[05:42] your mortgage or not, I'm going to be able to buy groceries for kids, please reach out to

[05:45] me and we can figure something out.

[05:48] And so by saying that, you automatically prospective everyone that listen, no one's going

[05:51] to go homeless over this thing, right?

[05:52] No one's going to lose their house because we're raising the price of our XYZ, right?

[05:56] Right?

[05:57] But we open the door for discussion for the people who feel obligated or feel the need to do

[06:01] this.

[06:02] Now, if you make an announcement like this, which I recommend you do in the video and

[06:05] be a direct mail, you want to make it and then also turn the comments off on whatever the

[06:10] post is because believe me, you don't want to do it that.

[06:12] As you just say, hey, I don't want this to be a gossip forum.

[06:15] If you have anything, just bring it through me directly out of respect for you.

[06:18] I want to do with these face to face and not over the keyboard, right?

[06:22] And so it's an easier way to also manage and mitigate any kind of negativity that happens.

[06:25] And believe me, if you raise your prices, you're going to have people who are going to

[06:28] be squeaky wheels and it's in their best interest to get you to not raise the prices.

[06:31] So just don't chicken out.

[06:33] Once you commit to it, stick with it.

[06:35] All right?

[06:36] Because I'm telling you, if you raise your price, like I just said, if you're of a 25% margin and

[06:39] you raise your price by 25%, you double your profit.

[06:42] All right.

[06:43] So I told you, I lost a third of my customers.

[06:44] That's because I tripled my price and most businesses don't realize how much of a pain

[06:50] it is to find another one of your business.

[06:52] And so if you can capitalize on that and you can usually e-cout and increase in revenue and

[06:57] profit as a result, you will be far out rewarded by making that change.

[07:02] And the people who do leave are usually your worst customers and you've been wanting to get

[07:05] rid of them anyways and this gives you a great time to do it.

[07:07] So if you're going to raise your price, this is the way that I do it to existing customers.

[07:11] I write a letter, I tell them, you know, why I'm setting the stage for why we're doing this.

[07:16] I tell them all the things that we're currently doing that they don't know that we're doing.

[07:19] And you probably do tell the stuff, it's good to list stuff out.

[07:21] Then you tell them about the future of what's going to happen, what the benefits are going

[07:24] to be to them, to what they're about to enjoy and how that's going to impact them in a real

[07:28] way in every single time they see you, they experience your business, they interact with

[07:32] you and what benefit of the benefit is going to occur.

[07:35] And then finally, I like to end with values in perspective.

[07:38] All right, it's probably values are right here.

[07:39] So values is kind of the wrap up.

[07:41] So just consider that 3.5, sorry.

[07:43] 3.5, right?

[07:46] And then you have your wrap up, which is, hey, big picture.

[07:49] This isn't going to make your break you, you're not going to go homeless because of this,

[07:52] but if you do have something that's going to materially affect you because you have that

[07:55] anchor, it makes it very easier for you to have that discussion.

[07:57] Right?

[07:58] And so if you have to raise your price, this is how I reckon doing it, I actually have the exact letter

[08:02] that we send out for gyms in my book if you want to grab it, you can't.

[08:06] I promise you, it's not how I make my dollars.

[08:09] But you can get that Alex's book.com.

[08:10] If you're curious, otherwise keeping amazing, keeping awesome, I made this channel so that

[08:17] a lot of people are broke and I don't want you to be one of them, so that's why I made

[08:19] this.

[08:20] So keeping awesome, so you guys don't flip like, bye.

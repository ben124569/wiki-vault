[00:00] What you don't know can kill you and ultimately will because at the end of the day all of us are going to die and

[00:06] After having built two multi-efeuer companies another eight-figure company another eight-figure company and then now we have a portfolio of companies

[00:13] I'm that do just about a million a week. I've I've learned some things about financial education and things like that

[00:19] And I realized I was wildly deficient in other areas and so in this search for meaning and figuring out

[00:25] You know what I want to do when I grow up

[00:28] I've kind of bucketed the different disciplines that I think all of us have to learn as entrepreneurs to

[00:35] Fill the whole that we have in our souls and I think a lot of us

[00:38] You know we we pursue business because we feel like it is going to fill this whole even on some level

[00:45] We know it won't but we do it anyways because we just don't have another best bet and so

[00:50] after having

[00:52] Enough money to question the the meaning of life

[00:55] I've kind of look at it looked at these at these buckets at seven things and so that's what I'm gonna talk about in this video

[01:01] And I think it's useful because a lot of times we just don't know what we lack and simply having an

[01:06] Understanding of the breath of topics and disciplines that we should have and understand

[01:10] We'll show us where deficiencies are and I believe that you need all seven in order to feel

[01:15] More complete and I've made more progress in these things

[01:18] I feel like I've been able to unearth my singular meaning

[01:21] I was not necessarily yours but for me it's to learn I love learning and so for me

[01:26] One of the best ways of learning is teaching and so get questions all the time about why I make these videos like what like why would I care about doing this stuff for free

[01:34] I

[01:35] Do it for me because I love learning and I I learned best through teaching you know what I'm going through right now

[01:40] And so these are the seven different disciplines that I think every human being has to learn

[01:44] All right, so the first is foundational education all right now the good thing is the system is pretty decent at

[01:52] Teaching this one all right, so this is like reading writing and then math like that's how I see it

[01:57] It's like if you can read right and math and and do math

[02:00] You'll learn that from school and specifically just like reading right it yet reading writing and math

[02:04] They're kind of what I would consider foundational principles because from there you can use reading and writing and

[02:10] Math to learn the rest of the principles right and so this one's foundational and this is pretty much the only one that we get taught in school

[02:17] Which is why everyone are at least for me

[02:19] I felt wildly deficient to do with the real world because there's so many other things right which is crazy to me that like what we cover are not

[02:27] I think we should just get foundations if I were to redesign our education system

[02:30] I would just teach reading writing and math and then the rest of it would be around these disciplines all right

[02:36] So the next thing is physical all right and the thing is is if you're living in this world

[02:41] You live in the physical plane and so you have to understand what you need to eat and how do you need to move in order to you know

[02:46] Increase your energy longevity et cetera and so all the things under the this is bucket energy men

[02:51] It I sorry would be like sleep

[02:54] You know like your own sleep routines if you have them, but not to be religious about them or superstitious about them because

[03:00] Those end up becoming handicaps more than they actually end up helping you

[03:03] But how to actually train to look through you want to look how to eat the way you want to look how to eat and train the way

[03:09] So you can know how you want to feel all of this stuff because you exist in this plane and we have these bodies for our whole lives

[03:14] And so it would be who of us to learn how to do these things because all the rest of these disciplines are no longer a priority

[03:21] If your physical health is is is is waning right?

[03:25] It's like was it the there's there's a saying about the everybody can have every wish in the world except for when you're sick

[03:30] You only have one which is to not be sick

[03:33] Right, and so learning this is what I would consider the second level of education

[03:37] The third level of education that I've outlined for myself is professional right and this is one word depending on what your

[03:45] What your

[03:47] Skill set is right or what sorry what what career path you want to go down

[03:51] Some schools or you know if you want to be an accountant there's pretty decent

[03:54] There's decent career path there if you learn that skill now most accountants would say yeah

[03:58] When I had my you know once I graduated with my mac or my master's in counting

[04:01] That's when really my real education began right and so many of these are like that

[04:05] Especially from the the formal education standpoint

[04:08] But hopefully as I'm going through these you can think to yourself like okay

[04:11] Where am I lacking and as I get higher and higher up?

[04:13] I will tell you I think the fulfillment and the meaning that you can drive for them

[04:17] These kind of work like a pyramid right like this is the base and then you build up all right

[04:21] The next level of this

[04:24] Without I would consider is a emotional all right

[04:29] And this one you have to continue to grow over time because this is just like understanding your own your own feelings and thoughts

[04:35] And as you you know grows an entrepreneur

[04:37] You have to know these things because you'll you'll figure out where your deficiencies are all of us have them and if you can't think to yourself

[04:43] What your deficiencies are and name them and be okay with yourself while still having them?

[04:48] I think that you get stuck there because you just don't know how to fix yourself right?

[04:52] I'm not that you need to be fixed, but how to grow right?

[04:55] And so this is the kind of the fourth the fourth level of education now note this one

[04:59] We don't get taught anything about at all anywhere right and you have to learn all this stuff on your own

[05:03] And most of us they have no education on this so think about how much time you've devoted to like this one now

[05:08] Because now we're really departing from form of education obviously

[05:11] There's not much form of education around physical recesses that's really count right?

[05:15] The next level that that I have here is a relational

[05:19] All right, so this is how to communicate

[05:22] Influence and deal with others and

[05:24] This is wildly important because first you have to master yourself right and then the next step there is being able to relate to others in a way

[05:32] That is that is meaningful and so by doing that you're able to influence others

[05:35] You're able to build groups build tribes build companies all of this is gonna be

[05:40] Predicated on your ability to do with other humans again. This is in taught anywhere, right?

[05:44] That's why you know some some of the books that there were most most transformation from transformational for me in my life

[05:51] We're books that that talks about how to deal with other people how to communicate right how to how to how to

[05:56] How people like you right how to have people trust you and really the flip side of that is how to be like a bull and how to be trustworthy

[06:02] Rather than some like hacks or tricks it's so much more about the character traits

[06:05] Which is the ugly answer, but it's also probably the truth

[06:08] So these are the these are the five levels and if you're looking at yourself right now

[06:11] Hopefully you should be like well how much time am I spending learning this discipline for my own emotions?

[06:16] How much time am I spending learning this discipline in learning how to relate to others?

[06:20] The next one that that I that I have here is financial

[06:26] All right

[06:27] Financial literacy and I would say this first in the beginning is personal finance

[06:31] Which is basically learning how to spend less than you make and then ideally significantly less than you make

[06:36] If you listen any of my stuff because wealth is a ratio

[06:39] It is not a number it is a it is a ratio between how much your universe is how much you spend

[06:44] So if you want to increase your wealth you can decrease your expenses and instead of doing become more wealthy

[06:48] Think about that for a second and while you process that I will I will tell you

[06:54] The second iteration of financial which is then how to multiply so the beginning it's about the getting

[06:59] Getting of the money and then the next level to how to multiply the money that you have right and have the money work for you

[07:04] And that's that's I would say currently

[07:06] This is where I'm focusing a lot of my time and attention because I want you learn that game that being said

[07:12] A lot of these things combined together right like if you want to have a business

[07:15] You need to know how to manage your own emotions

[07:16] You need to know how to relate to others you need to how to manage finance

[07:19] You need to have some skills that you have professionally can provide about in the marketplace and and remember with like for this

[07:24] Professional school that I was saying earlier only if you have like a formal career path

[07:28] You're gonna learn this in the in the in the formal education system, which is you know

[07:32] Failing everybody even more every every day

[07:34] But most most professions right you learn you learn by doing you learn by getting into that industry right

[07:41] And so that's why there's no school for entrepreneurship not really you know

[07:45] It there's entrepreneurship schools but like let's be honest like they're not legit

[07:48] The the the real school for entrepreneurship is just getting into the game and starting to plot

[07:53] And so right now is where thing and you're going through this right I've named six and I'll tell you the last one in a second

[07:58] But think about where you read on these like how much time am I spending learning about financial education how much time

[08:04] I spent can I read a balance sheet right?

[08:06] Can I read a cash flow statement?

[08:08] Relational right like how much time I spending learning how to relate to others?

[08:11] Do you say things like and this is important for everyone who has an identity which is everyone right?

[08:16] Do you face things like like I don't play well with others?

[08:18] I don't even like saying that me personally is I'm telling you this I don't like saying that I don't like speaking that over myself

[08:23] But I can tell you the more you could become aware of how people say I am I do I have right?

[08:28] I must I should

[08:29] etc. People tell you they're own limiting beliefs and the things that you say and the things that you speak over yourself

[08:35] Become your reality and like this is very true like I'm I don't want to say this like people will say

[08:42] I'm not good with money right?

[08:43] I don't even like saying it right because you speak this belief into yourself and that becomes your reality

[08:48] And so the first thing you have to do is start correcting your language

[08:50] That you know it's like I have a I have a weakness here

[08:53] I have a deficiency in terms of my learning right because then it becomes an opportunity that you can fix rather than I am this way

[08:59] It is certain I speak this way and therefore will never grow right and so as you're looking through these pillars of disciplines

[09:05] That that come inevitably on the entrepreneurial journey

[09:08] You have to you have to see which are deficiencies are and learn it right and that's and if you're like looking at this and this seems overwhelming

[09:14] Well, you have your whole life to learn them which is what I think is inspiring and I honestly

[09:19] Think for me looking at these disciplines has given me a lot of meaning in my own life

[09:24] Because I just see this is so much stuff that I want to do. I want to learn all this stuff and then it makes it makes living more interesting for me

[09:30] And then finally the last one is philosophical

[09:36] All right and this is

[09:38] This is the values that you choose to live by these are the things that you believe to be true that are eternal and so for me

[09:45] This has been incredibly

[09:48] Incredibly useful and I can tell you guys for anybody who's watching this like when you have enough money to spend millions of dollars a year

[09:54] Every single year for the rest of your life just on the money that you have a assuming it doesn't even grow

[09:59] Like you ask different and weirder like life gets weird right you have weirder questions

[10:03] As you ask and then you realize there's really so hopefully I can jump to the the end of that for for anybody who's curious

[10:09] You won't get more fulfillment from all of these things any one of these things

[10:12] But it's really

[10:14] Feeling how you can balance all these things, but I think that philosophical

[10:18] Despite the fact that I said it's the seventh bucket

[10:20] I actually think that it's the most important bucket and all of the changes in my own subjective well-being and how much I enjoy living

[10:27] Have come from fundamental shifts in my philosophy about what I what I believe it means to be human and

[10:34] The time that we spend here on earth and so

[10:38] Anyways, if you're looking at yourself and you're looking at your own deficits

[10:41] A and that's okay is one of my favorite settings that I tell myself my own self talk

[10:47] Right, I'm not good at this and that's okay

[10:49] Right, I'm not good at this yet and that's okay

[10:52] I'm not good at the relational side with other people yet and that's okay

[10:57] Right, because I'm going to learn right I'm not as good at the finances as I would like to be yet and that's okay

[11:04] Right, and so it becomes it gets you out of this defeatist talk this absolutism of being deficient and

[11:10] Making it is something that's an opportunity for to grow it and I know this sounds minor

[11:13] But I'm telling you when I look at the employees that I have I look at the people that are in our company

[11:17] I look at the the businesses that we work with I can tell immediately by someone's language patterns

[11:22] How likely they are to grow right and so the first thing you can do is correct your own language patterns for each of these each of these buckets

[11:29] But getting back to philosophical right as the seventh bucket

[11:33] This bucket I believe is I mean it's the meaning of life, right and what will happen is if you are doing all

[11:40] Of these things you're doing your financial education you're making more money

[11:42] You're increasing your influence you through your relational discipline you're your your set your sense of self and

[11:48] Your emotional management your impulse control is improving right your your professional skills are

[11:54] Enhatsing your physical well-being your energy you're sleeping the habits that you have around that are things that are increasing

[11:59] Your longevity increasing your energy increasing your sense of well-being from a physical standpoint and

[12:04] Hopefully you have the foundational education of learning of reading and writing

[12:07] Which if you don't you should do that first because it's the gateway to learning all these other things

[12:10] But the thing is is all of these other ones if you don't know why you're doing them

[12:14] I think that ultimately you don't feel better

[12:17] So you may improve all of these things, but you don't feel better and I think that most of us just want to feel better

[12:22] And so for me making strides in understanding why I do what I do and where I derive meaning in life

[12:28] Has been one of the most

[12:30] fulfilling for me and ultimately why I've been increasing my you know

[12:34] Contents stuff on the channels and I'm writing books right now that I'll be releasing for free for everyone

[12:38] Just to help other entrepreneurs and people make positive contribution with the potential that they all that we all have inside of us and so anyways

[12:46] I wish you an absolutely amazing day

[12:49] Stay tuned for my next video. I hope you love it and I'll see you in the next vid

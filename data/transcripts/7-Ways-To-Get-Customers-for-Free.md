[00:00] I'm going to give you seven,

[00:01] obscenely easy ways to get customers

[00:03] for free that you can implement within this week.

[00:06] These tactics have made me millions of dollars.

[00:08] They actually work and I'll give you the real stats

[00:10] that I got when I use them in my business

[00:12] so you can use them in yours.

[00:13] You should be obsessed with getting referrals

[00:14] and here's why.

[00:15] Referrals buy at higher percentages,

[00:17] add higher prices,

[00:19] they buy more often,

[00:20] they buy more times,

[00:22] and they're the most likely customer to yes,

[00:25] we're a fur you more customers.

[00:27] And so if you have two types of customers

[00:28] that you could potentially get,

[00:29] one that costs you a lot of money

[00:30] and does none of these things.

[00:32] And one that's free that does all of those things,

[00:34] which would you prefer?

[00:35] Well, obviously this one.

[00:36] And independent of how big your business gets.

[00:39] 30% of your business coming from referrals,

[00:42] no matter you're at 100 million or 100,000 year,

[00:44] still grows your business by 30%.

[00:46] And when it's that big and it's still free,

[00:49] that's the type of stuff that compounds a business

[00:51] into infinity versus having one that platos

[00:53] because not enough people tell other people about it.

[00:55] So the first one is,

[00:57] when I looked at one of our profiliers

[00:58] and he's got a new sales guy who came in

[01:00] and crushed all of the records

[01:02] that had ever been done on that sales team.

[01:03] And that was a very experienced sales team.

[01:05] And I was like, what does this guy do it?

[01:07] Does he have higher close rates on the phone?

[01:08] And he didn't have higher close rates

[01:09] but for some reason, he was able to get

[01:11] 30 to 50% more sales than everybody else.

[01:14] And I was like, okay, so how is he getting more opportunities?

[01:16] And so we got on the call,

[01:18] we listened to all those scripts were like,

[01:19] he's not doing anything different.

[01:20] And so we pulled the guy up where like, dude,

[01:22] what are you doing?

[01:23] And he said, I don't know,

[01:25] after I closed the customer,

[01:27] I just say, who else do you know

[01:29] who might also want this?

[01:31] And I usually get like one out of three people

[01:33] to send me one or two other people.

[01:35] And I just do that on every sale

[01:37] because I learned that in my last job.

[01:40] And when he said that, it was like this big obvious duh

[01:43] that I'm sure was in the SOP at some point

[01:45] for the sales team.

[01:46] And of course, people get lazy

[01:47] because they don't want to scare the sale away.

[01:49] But by simply saying, hey, who else?

[01:51] Very clear, who else do you know?

[01:53] Not, do you know anybody?

[01:55] Yes, no, it's who else do you know?

[01:57] Who do you think would benefit from this

[01:59] who you'd want to do this with?

[02:00] Right?

[02:01] Because now you're actually asking them to solve

[02:02] a problem with their brain.

[02:03] Not make a quick guest no answer,

[02:04] which is what most people just say, no,

[02:05] I don't know anybody, let's move on.

[02:06] And number one, this isn't going to be your grandmother's

[02:08] referral video on, hey, you should ask for referrals.

[02:11] I'm going to give you some very specific strategies

[02:12] on what to do, how to say it, in a way

[02:15] that I'll actually get the likely that they do it pretty high.

[02:17] Now, referrals are super valuable for number reasons.

[02:20] One is that they compound with the business,

[02:22] meaning whether you're a $100 million business,

[02:23] 30% on a $100 million or 30% on a 100 grand,

[02:26] it's still going to be 30%.

[02:27] And so it's one of the most scalable ways

[02:29] to grow business overall.

[02:30] The biggest companies in the world,

[02:31] the vast majority of what they get is from word of mouth.

[02:33] It's from people telling other people.

[02:35] And in today's society where people are

[02:37] more able to share things faster and bigger across broader audiences

[02:41] and networks, it matters more than ever.

[02:43] It's so funny because people are like,

[02:44] men, why are my ads?

[02:45] They were working now, they're not.

[02:47] Everybody believes in positive word of mouth.

[02:48] They don't believe in negative word of mouth,

[02:49] but both word of mouth happened because that's how this works.

[02:52] Number two, referrals who come in are more likely to buy,

[02:55] so they have a higher close rate,

[02:57] they pay more, they're more likely to buy

[02:59] a more premium version of what you have,

[03:01] and they're also more likely to refer other customers.

[03:05] So you get three spins on the money-making wheel

[03:08] from having referrals versus a cold customer.

[03:10] So if you have, let's say a recurring membership business,

[03:13] they have 10% monthly turn.

[03:15] Well, you can obviously always keep trying to decrease

[03:17] that turn, but one of the other things

[03:18] that will always come about at any level,

[03:20] so if you have a thousand customers, you can turn 10%,

[03:22] you need a 100 new customers' to break even.

[03:24] One of the very smart things that business owners do

[03:27] is they say, okay, well, if I can get 10% of my customers

[03:29] to refer someone every month, then I can offset that turn

[03:32] so that my business is stable.

[03:34] And so by having a consistent way to get your,

[03:36] all your customers to refer you 10%,

[03:38] you can make up for the 10% turn that you have.

[03:40] And the ratio between your referral percentage

[03:42] and your turn percentage is you're going to be

[03:44] your stable at rest, growth rate.

[03:48] And so if you could have even 20% referrals on 10%,

[03:52] then it means you're gonna grow two to one,

[03:53] and you will keep growing two to one no matter how big you get.

[03:56] Number one, this is called the gift card play.

[03:58] So I use this during holiday season.

[04:00] So either you make up a holiday, it's like,

[04:02] hey, it's my birthday, it's my wife's birthday,

[04:04] it's the anniversary of the business,

[04:05] or you go with the standard holidays,

[04:07] it's Christmas, it's Easter, it's, you know,

[04:09] you can make it a spring thing, it doesn't really matter.

[04:11] You just have to a reason why to do the gift cards.

[04:14] Now, what you do with the gift cards,

[04:16] it works especially well at Christmas,

[04:17] is that you say that they are gifts for other people.

[04:20] So you offer to your membership base,

[04:21] and here's how it works.

[04:23] Is that you want the amount for the gift card to be equal

[04:26] to one of your core unit of service.

[04:29] So something that you would normally give away for free.

[04:31] So if you were an SEO agency,

[04:32] you might have a $2,000 month service.

[04:34] Okay, then it would be $2,000 with the gift card would be.

[04:37] Now you're like, wait, $2,000 gift card, yes,

[04:39] this is why it's so compelling.

[04:40] If you had a garage door fixing business,

[04:44] and there's three elements to your service,

[04:45] you'd make it the base level, the cheapest level,

[04:47] is what the gift card would be equivalent to.

[04:49] So let's say you have up to $1,000 stuff

[04:51] and the lowest thing is $200.

[04:53] Then you make the gift card $1,200.

[04:55] Now, that step one is what you price the discount,

[04:58] the gift card at.

[04:59] The second element is what you make the discount for.

[05:02] And the discount you want to be as aggressive as possible.

[05:05] And so I recommend 90% or more discount on this.

[05:07] So if I have a $2,000 thing,

[05:09] 90% discount is $200 bucks.

[05:11] And you're like, wait, I'm not going to make money on this.

[05:13] Hold on, the point here is,

[05:15] what would you already give away for free

[05:17] in terms of service or product

[05:18] in order to get a new customer?

[05:20] Probably a lot, especially if you know

[05:21] that it referrals with a lot of money.

[05:22] And this is where it gets, this is where the money,

[05:24] this is where it gets magical.

[05:26] OK?

[05:27] Is that what you do?

[05:28] Is you say, hey, I'm going to be giving this gift cards away.

[05:31] Only two more existing customers.

[05:33] And you can only give them to other people

[05:35] for the holiday season.

[05:36] Now, I'm going to limit them.

[05:38] This is a key point.

[05:39] Limit two per customer, because that also gets everyone

[05:41] to buy two so that they refer you two customers.

[05:44] And so that customer now buys two, 90% off coupons

[05:48] that they have to give to two individual people

[05:49] that they can't use on themselves.

[05:51] And when they make the purchase,

[05:52] you say, who you want me to make this gift card out to?

[05:55] And guess what happens there?

[05:56] By making the gift card out to somebody,

[05:58] you also capture the lead.

[05:59] And so you get two referral leads that you get paid for.

[06:02] This is what I'm saying.

[06:03] You get paid for the referral lead.

[06:05] Everybody else, you have to pay money

[06:07] to get leads here.

[06:07] You get paid to get leads.

[06:09] All right?

[06:09] Big difference here.

[06:10] So whatever, if you want to get really nuanced about it,

[06:13] you could just make it your cost to your car, customer.

[06:14] But I think it's far more compelling

[06:16] to make it whatever your base unit is

[06:18] with the assumption that you know

[06:19] that you're going to be able to bring this person in it

[06:20] and then upsell for levels of service.

[06:22] And then use that gift card against that.

[06:24] And so obviously we've written this in the brick and more

[06:26] of gym space, which is where I started.

[06:27] And so we would run, let's say $200 gift card,

[06:29] which is about a month, and you get 90% off,

[06:31] so that people would pay $20 for $200 gift card.

[06:34] And now they look like amazing family members.

[06:36] They're like, hey, I gave you $200 gift card

[06:38] and you $200 gift card to my gym.

[06:40] The person comes in with the card

[06:42] because you have their numbers.

[06:43] So you can text them and follow up.

[06:44] And then you put an expiration date on the gift card.

[06:47] This is very important.

[06:48] Is the expiration on the gift card

[06:49] is we 30 days.

[06:50] Because you want them to use it as fast as possible.

[06:52] This is a new year long thing.

[06:53] You need to put urgency to get the lead in the door.

[06:56] So then you follow up and say, hey, Sandra gave you that gift card.

[07:00] Let's get you in here.

[07:01] And then when they come in, you have that $200 thing.

[07:03] At the base level, you give the free month

[07:05] that you'd be happy to do anyways, and you get their card.

[07:07] They're credit card.

[07:08] Or you can take that and say, hey,

[07:10] I think you'd be best suited for the $2000 package.

[07:12] I'm going to take the $200, put it against that, and boom.

[07:14] Now I took my $200 gift card, put it against some

[07:17] of this 10 times more expensive.

[07:18] They got 10, really 10% off, and I still got paid 20 bucks

[07:21] for the lead and to make the sale.

[07:23] And think about the math here.

[07:24] So if you have a big customer base and you sell two per customer,

[07:26] and you have 200 customers in your base,

[07:29] and you get 30 of them to buy two cards each,

[07:32] that's 60 cards that you give out,

[07:34] and you're going to convert a huge percentage of those cards.

[07:37] So you bring 50 of those 60 in the door,

[07:40] and you're going to close a big chunk of those people

[07:42] and depending on the price point, multiply that by your price,

[07:44] take out the discount.

[07:45] There you go.

[07:46] You don't lose money for three reasons.

[07:48] One, you're not paying cost to acquire the customer.

[07:51] Two, the amount, the thing that you're giving away

[07:53] is the discount is something you should be comfortable

[07:55] given away, that you would normally give away

[07:57] as a lead magnet or a free level of service

[07:59] just to attract you guys from or anyways.

[08:00] And so when you have a normal way to get a customer,

[08:02] usually if some sort of promo, and you have a cost

[08:05] to display that promo to people in terms of advertising,

[08:08] you pay neither of those costs, and then you make money

[08:10] because you're still getting paid by the customer

[08:13] to get the gift card, and then the third way

[08:15] that you can offset this is that you can still sell them

[08:17] into something that's far more expensive.

[08:19] And so at the very worst case scenario, you make

[08:21] a little bit of money on the discounted cash

[08:24] to give away a level of service that you're comfortable

[08:27] giving away anyways.

[08:28] So the second one is super tactical,

[08:29] and it's a very specific point in the sales process.

[08:32] And so when someone comes up to you and says,

[08:34] hey, I want to buy these services, can you give me a discount?

[08:38] We've all heard this, hey, can you make it a little less?

[08:40] Hey, can you give me a homey hook?

[08:41] Hey, I know somebody, do you think you could, blah, blah, blah, blah,

[08:43] right?

[08:44] So you say, sure, I'd love to.

[08:47] Just give me the name of three friends,

[08:48] and I'm happy to give you the discount.

[08:50] And so by doing that, you can't immediately sit like,

[08:53] because what happens is they walk into a trap,

[08:55] because they're going to like lean in as soon as you say,

[08:57] oh, I can totally give you that discount.

[08:59] Just give me the name of three friends.

[09:00] And then all of a sudden they're like, oh, it's like, yeah,

[09:03] I will happily do that if you do something for me.

[09:05] And be amazed at how many times that actually works

[09:07] to like, oh, so if you don't make

[09:08] introduce you three friends for your service or whatever,

[09:10] you'll give me this discount.

[09:11] I'll say, you're all.

[09:12] But we do that right now.

[09:14] And you got to make the introduction.

[09:15] And so by doing that, you lock in three leads.

[09:18] They get the discount that you might have been willing to give

[09:19] before.

[09:20] I personally never discount unless there's a change in terms.

[09:23] And so either I change what I sell

[09:25] or they have to do something for me.

[09:26] And so this is the second way, which is they basically

[09:28] do some advertising on my behalf.

[09:30] And so in exchange, I give them the discount

[09:32] because I'm paying, that discount is my cost

[09:34] to get those leads, which I'm willing to pay for.

[09:36] If someone's asking for a discount, I mean,

[09:38] again, everything's going to come down to what

[09:40] is your cost to your car customer normally.

[09:42] And so if I figure, I'm going to convert one out

[09:44] of these three referrals, then I would say one third

[09:47] of cac times three.

[09:49] So one xcac, your cost to your car customer, whatever

[09:51] it normally is, is what I'd be willing to give

[09:53] us a discount on the main thing.

[09:54] And as you become more experienced with this,

[09:55] you start to get more and more predictable metrics.

[09:58] And in the beginning, I just want this to work.

[09:59] You can start fine tuning.

[10:00] Hey, I'll give you a hundred bucks per referral or whatever.

[10:03] Now, the second way that you can do this is that,

[10:06] instead of offering the discount, you can offer more service

[10:09] that's in equivalent amount.

[10:10] And the reason you do that is because,

[10:12] let's say I charge $200 for my thing,

[10:14] and it actually cost me $40 to deliver,

[10:17] if someone says, hey, kind of get a $200 discount,

[10:19] I see how do you one better.

[10:20] I'll give you $400 a service for free,

[10:22] if you send me the person now,

[10:23] the $400 service to me only cost me $80,

[10:26] but the perceived value of the $400 service

[10:28] actually makes it even a bigger, quote, discount

[10:30] for them to get the thing and send me the traffic.

[10:33] And so it's the second version, kind of,

[10:35] two A and two B of that second strategy.

[10:38] And if you want to hear how to take the referral process,

[10:40] I just outlined it, put it on steroids.

[10:42] I have a course that goes with this book,

[10:44] it's free, come down.

[10:46] That's on my site at acquisition.com.

[10:48] You can click the lead course,

[10:49] you don't even have to opt in for it.

[10:50] And just go to the affiliates chapter.

[10:52] It's a 45 minute video, I think,

[10:54] ish that breaks down everything that you can do

[10:56] to get more customers by partnering people

[10:58] who send you customers on a regular basis.

[11:00] And number three is actually a permutation of number two,

[11:02] but just done instead of on the discount,

[11:04] you do it on the positive.

[11:05] She says, hey, so you asked for $100 discount,

[11:07] how about it to you one better?

[11:08] I'll give you $200 of extra stuff.

[11:10] And the reason I'm willing to do that

[11:12] is a business center, you don't say this,

[11:13] this is makes money to you.

[11:14] The $200 of service or stuff might cost me $40,

[11:18] whereas giving $200 off the price

[11:20] is gonna cost me hard cost $200.

[11:23] And so I'd rather give you $400 of value

[11:25] for 40 or 80 bucks of cost.

[11:27] So actually reduce what my effective discount is,

[11:30] but I also increase the value for the prospect.

[11:33] And one of the nice valuable things here

[11:34] is that you're just encouraging a customer

[11:36] to use your service more,

[11:37] or use your product more, which is always a good thing.

[11:39] And the fourth version of this

[11:40] is one that I used all the time and it crushed for me.

[11:43] And so what I did was as soon as the sales over,

[11:46] I would say, hey, do you know how you can get this stuff for free?

[11:49] And every time I did this, when we'd have ourselves

[11:51] 30% of ourselves for every one of our promotions,

[11:54] would come from people using the word of mouth,

[11:57] the referral strategy that I'm about to talk about.

[11:59] All right, so it works really well.

[12:01] And so at the end of the sale,

[12:03] you already got the car,

[12:04] you already signed up and you say, hey, by the way,

[12:06] do you know how to get this for free?

[12:07] Everyone leans in, they're like, yeah, of course I want to

[12:09] all right, I get it for free.

[12:09] So now we're not talking about discounts.

[12:11] We're talking about how do I get it for free?

[12:12] And so what you say is, hey, if this thing's 500 bucks,

[12:16] you say for every person you bring in,

[12:18] I'll give you 100 bucks in cash.

[12:20] And it was a real $100 cash check

[12:23] that I would give these people.

[12:24] And so I had so many people, I had have nurses

[12:27] or teachers who had huge networks of people

[12:30] that they worked with on a regular basis

[12:31] and said, hey, you wanna do this weight loss challenge with me,

[12:34] or whatever it was.

[12:35] And so I would have one girl come

[12:37] or for me, 10 people, make 500 bucks.

[12:39] And I would get 10 customers from this one person.

[12:41] Now that was obviously on the sale,

[12:43] not on them making the introductions.

[12:45] That was the big difference between the first two

[12:47] and this one is, I would say it was only after the fact,

[12:50] after the sale that they'd be able to get the 100 bucks.

[12:52] But that's laid for me.

[12:55] I've tactically executed this two different ways of my career.

[12:58] Way number one is that underneath of my contract,

[13:00] I had all the names of the referrals always listed out there.

[13:03] And that would remind me and my sales guys

[13:05] to ask for that referral and also know

[13:06] that that person would be attributed back to that customer.

[13:09] Remember, I came from analog brick and mortar,

[13:12] I printed out contracts.

[13:13] Okay.

[13:14] The second way is to just do the digital way,

[13:16] which is, hey, introduce me right now with your friend,

[13:18] which I'll show you the real taxid on that

[13:21] in one of the future ones, because it's really good.

[13:23] Which leads me to number five, which is referral at success.

[13:25] And so the moment that someone has some big thing,

[13:28] you just finished painting their house,

[13:29] you put their garage door in or you train their dog

[13:32] or you help them lose weight.

[13:33] There's a moment of transformation that you had.

[13:35] And a lot of times that's where you capture testimonials.

[13:37] Now, for sure, capture the testimonial.

[13:39] But right afterwards, their amp, their feeling good,

[13:41] they love your service, they just experienced it.

[13:43] When you say, hey, you're amazing.

[13:46] How many other amazing people like you do you know?

[13:49] And usually they're like, I don't know,

[13:51] and then they start giggling whatever, and you're like,

[13:52] awesome.

[13:54] Can we take a picture together to commemorate the moment?

[13:56] And then they say, yes, let me give you a phone.

[13:58] So you take their phone, you do a selfie and say, hey,

[14:00] let's take this picture.

[14:01] Who do you know that we can send this to?

[14:03] That we can invite them in so we can do this with them?

[14:06] And by making that asking you do it from their phone,

[14:08] you text yourself through their phone

[14:11] with the picture of you, the outcome, and them.

[14:13] So if it's you and the dog or you and the garage,

[14:15] you're just you and them skinny.

[14:17] You text them and say, hey, this is Sandra,

[14:20] you should meet Alex and I used to joke around in like,

[14:22] you're like, Alex is the coolest guy of all type.

[14:24] He's the most amazing man.

[14:25] You should totally, because they knew that I was texting his them.

[14:28] And they would get a laugh out of it.

[14:30] And so mind you.

[14:31] This is where you have to ever pour the customer.

[14:33] If you don't have to report, then this isn't going to work.

[14:34] But for me, this is why having it at the success moment,

[14:37] it's like you've literally demonstrated the result.

[14:39] In front of you, to someone they know,

[14:42] and then that person is making the introduction,

[14:44] you mean like, dude, you've got to check this place out.

[14:46] It's awesome.

[14:47] They have the best crepes, or they have the totally fixed

[14:49] micro-age.

[14:50] And you said you were looking at fixing it.

[14:51] Look how nice mine looks, whatever it is.

[14:53] And that worked amazingly well to get referrals

[14:55] at the point of success.

[14:56] And so you'll notice the throughline here

[14:58] is that each of these moments is someone asked for discount, boom,

[15:01] you can get a referral.

[15:02] If you want to get a referral, you can add in a bonus,

[15:05] or you can flip the discount into a bonus.

[15:07] You can just ask them on a regular basis,

[15:10] hey, do you want to know how to get this for free?

[15:12] Which slayed for me.

[15:14] You can do the version here where at the point of success,

[15:16] you take the picture and you do the three-way introduction.

[15:18] All these versions work up seemingly well

[15:20] no matter how big your business is

[15:21] to get more customers in the door.

[15:22] Let's get the next one.

[15:23] And if you're watching on YouTube,

[15:24] tell me which of the seven you're actually going to do.

[15:26] Not what you think would be cooler,

[15:28] what you thought was neat, which one can you do

[15:30] and implement in the next 30 days?

[15:31] Number six, the next one is a hand-written card strategy.

[15:35] So here's how it works.

[15:36] You pair hand-written cards with in-person events

[15:39] or virtual events, but it works especially

[15:41] while for in-person events.

[15:42] And so if you have a member appreciation event

[15:44] or some sort of workshop or something

[15:45] that you're going to be holding on a quarterly basis

[15:48] or whatever cadence you have on.

[15:49] I'd recommend doing this at least quarterly

[15:50] if you have especially a local business.

[15:52] And so you invite the customer's in

[15:54] and it doesn't have to be high budget.

[15:55] It's just supposed to have some fun, have some food,

[15:58] it can be a pot lock, whatever.

[16:00] And so you invite all the customers there.

[16:02] And the way you do that is you write a handwritten card

[16:04] thinking them for their patronage

[16:05] and saying this is your invitation, your quarterly invited,

[16:08] to the quarterly or semi-annual painters are us event,

[16:12] whatever.

[16:13] And so you invite them to this event

[16:16] for you to appreciate them.

[16:17] Now you say PS, this is key PS on the letter,

[16:20] is to say if you take a screenshot of a screenshot,

[16:23] if you take a picture of this letter

[16:24] and you text it to a friend of yours,

[16:25] they can use that to get into the event

[16:27] and they can have all the food and all the drink they want

[16:28] and they can come with you.

[16:29] And if you want to so that I know them before they come

[16:32] in the door, just do a three way text with me

[16:34] and you can send that invite like you sending it to them.

[16:37] And by doing that, you can collect a bunch of leads

[16:39] and you say, hey, it's also all people are welcome.

[16:42] And so they can then bring other people with them

[16:44] to your event.

[16:45] And when we would do this, you get 30 to 50% of the room

[16:48] would be people who are friends and plus ones

[16:50] of the people who are coming to the event.

[16:52] And then at the event, all day long, think about this.

[16:54] All the people who are there, love you enough to show up

[16:56] to your event.

[16:57] And so they're all talking about awesome you are,

[16:59] whatever the thing is, and you're providing stuff

[17:00] to them, you're giving them food,

[17:01] you're in the drinks, you're going to entertain them.

[17:03] You're walking around your kitchen baby shaking hands.

[17:05] And so you seem like mayor of the town.

[17:06] So you get great positioning.

[17:08] And then all you do is, as you go, one on one,

[17:10] you say, hey, let's talk on Monday.

[17:11] Hey, let's get a time set up.

[17:11] Up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

[17:12] And all you do is you say, a shit little of appointments.

[17:14] Don't sell there.

[17:15] Just set fall up appointments.

[17:16] So that it's fun.

[17:17] It keeps it chill.

[17:18] And that we can collect a ton of leads.

[17:20] And after they've met you once in person,

[17:21] they're not going to ghost you on the next thing.

[17:23] And the likely they buy, because their friends are

[17:24] either there, they already literally consume something

[17:26] from you.

[17:27] The reciprocity laws at its highest amount,

[17:30] and so they're really likely to buy.

[17:31] So two quick tactical things that I learned in the hard way.

[17:35] Don't book these two far out.

[17:36] If someone's like, hey, I can do it two weeks from now,

[17:38] I'm like, girl, you're here right now.

[17:39] I was like, get in on Monday.

[17:40] I was like, let's coach these stars now.

[17:41] Let's go.

[17:42] You know what I mean?

[17:43] I always try to have that playful rapport

[17:45] so I could get people in faster,

[17:46] because obviously interest wanes really quickly.

[17:49] And so you have a very small period of time,

[17:51] where motivation is super high.

[17:53] And so we want to capitalize on that moment.

[17:54] And after the event happens, and I've already booked them,

[17:56] I treat them like a normal lead.

[17:57] So I'm going to still work them,

[17:58] send reminders, all the normal stuff you do.

[18:00] Number seven is the spousher crest.

[18:02] So this is a good one.

[18:02] So if you have a service that a spouse can do with them,

[18:07] so that could be like wine and paint night,

[18:09] that could be like I said, weight loss,

[18:11] that could be therapy, that could be anything that somebody

[18:14] could do, you ask them.

[18:16] So basically it pro acts the obstacle.

[18:20] So you get to be aggressive on it and say,

[18:22] hey, does your husband support you in this?

[18:24] Hey, do you think this would help your husband out?

[18:25] And or your wife out, whatever?

[18:27] And by doing that, you say, hey,

[18:29] we have an amazing spouse program.

[18:32] And we've actually seen that people who do it with their spouse.

[18:34] And this is the key part of it.

[18:35] Is you want to have some sort of stat that's associated with it?

[18:38] That shows people who do it with their spouse

[18:40] are three times more successful.

[18:41] And by doing that, then it's like, well,

[18:43] you want to be more successful.

[18:44] And so I would strongly, like,

[18:46] I don't use the word mandatory,

[18:47] and I would even say this in the scripting.

[18:48] I never say the word mandatory.

[18:50] But unless your spouse has a reason,

[18:54] they're foot fell off or they're about to go to the hospital.

[18:57] They're crazy.

[18:58] Unless it's one of those reasons, they should come with you.

[19:00] Because I think it's going to,

[19:01] it will be far more along lasting.

[19:03] What if the transformation is,

[19:04] it'll be far more effective.

[19:05] Whatever our intervention is.

[19:07] And you're going to have a much better experience.

[19:09] And you'll have support here and at home,

[19:10] which makes it way more likely that you'll win.

[19:12] And the last one is a bonus one,

[19:14] which is a friend of mine runs massive, massive online challenges.

[19:18] So this isn't just brick and mortar

[19:20] or just service businesses,

[19:21] like it works for any business.

[19:23] And you just have to think,

[19:24] how can I make this work for my business?

[19:26] It won't work for my business.

[19:27] Because I promise you that is the voice of the loser,

[19:29] like beating you into the loser ship.

[19:31] Okay, literally just in all messaging he had,

[19:35] all he did for an entire campaign was simply

[19:38] remind people in every piece of content,

[19:41] in every piece of messaging,

[19:42] and every ad, every post that he did throughout the entire campaign,

[19:45] was he just said, hey, be sure to bring a friend,

[19:48] it's far more likely that you'll succeed.

[19:50] You're going to love this if you do this together.

[19:52] And he just said it every time.

[19:54] And at the end of his campaign,

[19:55] and he's getting million plus customers

[19:57] when he runs these campaigns.

[19:58] So massive massive, massive scale.

[20:00] 25 to 30% of the customers came in from the campaign

[20:04] were from word of mouth,

[20:05] were from una-tributed sources.

[20:07] And when he didn't do this, it was almost nothing.

[20:09] And so he attributed that big jump to making sure

[20:13] that he woven the bring a friend, the bring someone else,

[20:16] that you're going to be more successful,

[20:18] the you'd have more support, you'll get faster results

[20:20] if you do it together.

[20:22] And so I would encourage you, obviously,

[20:24] these tactics that I just outlined

[20:26] give you when someone asks for a discount, how to do it.

[20:28] If it's the holidays, use it the gift card.

[20:30] If someone has a great success, that's the moment.

[20:32] If you want to get an event, you use it to use as a referral event.

[20:35] All of these tools are things that you can use

[20:37] at specific moments.

[20:39] But the big overarching one is that if you know

[20:41] that you can generate about 30% of your leads,

[20:43] and this is just what I've seen across our businesses,

[20:45] by implementing these strategies,

[20:47] you get 30% more customers by just asking,

[20:50] and actually weaving this in,

[20:52] and not being lazy about it,

[20:54] it's an obscenely easy way to get customers

[20:57] that are free, pay more, stay longer,

[20:59] and refer you more customers.

[21:02] Everybody want to get customers,

[21:03] but ain't nobody want to ask for referrals.

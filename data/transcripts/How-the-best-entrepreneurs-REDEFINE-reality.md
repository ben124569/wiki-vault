[00:00] In this video, I want to talk to you about how to eliminate problems in your life without taking any action.

[00:06] And as crazy as that may sound, I think that what I will share with you may sound even crazy.

[00:11] If you don't know who I am, my name is Oximosae on acquisition.com.

[00:13] It's a portfolio of companies that are more $100 million a year.

[00:15] And this lovely dolphin background painting is because I've been traveling a lot and we're in random

[00:19] or B&B's. So that being said, let's rock and roll.

[00:21] So yesterday I was having a conversation with an old friend of mine and we have different beliefs around

[00:26] the topic of problems, especially when it comes to the human condition.

[00:30] And I went on somewhat of a rant about this topic and I figured I would encapsulate it here for you guys.

[00:36] And so the problem that this individual is talking about was a lot of stuff that has to do with

[00:42] you know mental illness and mental health. And I think that this is an interesting topic because

[00:47] the entire like industry didn't even exist until a few hundred years ago.

[00:50] And humans have existed for a long period of time.

[00:53] One of the more interesting things about the mental quote illness category is the importance of

[00:59] labeling. And if you followed me for any period of time, you'll know that labeling to me is one of

[01:04] the strongest powers that exists in the mind. And I'll give you a reason why our minds are meaning

[01:12] making machines. And so what that means is we determine what is meaningful and what it's not.

[01:18] And then we ascribe labels to them in terms of positive and negative because that is how we survive.

[01:23] Now, that being said, our brains are meant to keep us alive, not meant to help us thrive.

[01:28] Right? Do you say rhyming word for you? Now, that being said, with this whole concept around labeling,

[01:33] it's something that I'm probably most passionate about. Like the concept of labeling as whole.

[01:37] It's unbelievably powerful when it comes to persuading people to do things, unbelievably powerful when

[01:42] it comes to changing people's worldviews and their perspectives on life. And I will share a few of

[01:47] those examples with you. So I'll give you a quick persuasion example for how powerful this is.

[01:50] If I wanted to persuade someone to do something, then what I would do is I would create a positive

[01:54] label that I would associate the website. So I would say you are probably a loving and caring man

[02:00] for you know, you want to provide support for your family. Is that true? They're like, yes,

[02:03] and I'm like, yeah, you definitely seem like one of those types of people. And since you are one of

[02:07] those types of people, I think that you should invest in this program that we have because that would

[02:11] be an alignment with this ideal that we just labeled the person with. And so what happens is it creates

[02:17] cognitive dissonance because for the person in order for them to stay in accordance with the label

[02:22] that they would like to have, they then feel obligated to then act in accordance with that label that

[02:27] we just prescribed. Now that's a very simplistic example. You can weave that into narratives and

[02:31] salescript so that people become psychologically labeled and then want to act in accordance with

[02:36] that label because they see it as positive. The thing is is that it can also work in reverse in

[02:40] terms of how you can harm someone. And the reason that this is so viscerally upsetting to me is that

[02:46] I have had members of my family extended it and what not, who have, I would say,

[02:50] debilitated themselves in large part because of what they believed to be mental illness and I disagree.

[02:55] Now, many people will get triggered at this and so I will say my big disclaimer which is this is

[02:59] not financial advice. This is not grammatical advice, this is not spiritual advice, this is not even

[03:03] advice. This is guy making you to video about stuff that pisses me off and hopefully some of the

[03:08] things that serve me well. Now let's talk about the labels that are negative. One of the things

[03:13] one of the most pernicious acts that exist negative bad stuff is when we take the human experience

[03:19] that has ups and downs that has extremes that exist on continuums and we label one side of the

[03:23] continuum as bad and the other side of the continuum is good. For example, happy, sad, energized or weak,

[03:31] tired, right? We have equal opposites, you know relaxed, stressed, right? There's lots of

[03:38] the reason that this is so dangerous when we give a positive or negative label is that people

[03:44] think that they have a problem when they are not feeling happy or energized or relaxed or clear

[03:51] minded versus foggy you. You don't mean whatever and the thing is is in order to fair their

[03:56] two be light, there must be darkness. Think about that for a second. In order for their two be good,

[04:02] there must also be bad. One, if you want to admit the existence of one, there must also be the

[04:08] existence of the other. Right, awesome. Now the problem, this is why we have to be careful with labels,

[04:15] that most people suffer from, is that the label normal variations in the human condition with negative

[04:21] experiences. And so they see themselves as tired and say this is bad. Whereas it's really just

[04:26] part of the human condition. They see themselves as sad rather than happy and see that as bad.

[04:32] And so what happens is you start to upgrade a finite emotional condition into a long-standing

[04:38] emotional disturbance because you think it's a problem. And the thing is it's very easy to sell people

[04:45] on why these things are problems. Big pharma is the king of this. Are you feeling tired,

[04:51] stressed? Are you hungry? Are you horny? Well, you are suffering from being a human being.

[04:58] It's being human. And so I think a lot of this and the reason that it wraps into the original part

[05:02] of the prompt of this video is that if we want to be enduring entrepreneurs, we want to be people

[05:07] whoever's isillience. We want to be with mental fortitude. We must be careful about the things that

[05:13] we label. And there's also the good bad label, which is the simplest label that a lot of people

[05:18] describe to conditions that are that are a femoral, right? They're they're brief, right? And then they

[05:23] change. But there's also the should's have must need to, etc. that we say in our lives that we have

[05:31] to do these things. What we must do these things. And if we do not or else we put out a threat towards

[05:37] the universe. If I don't get my coffee, I must get my coffee. I need to have coffee before I start my

[05:44] what happens is that we create these implied threats to ourselves, to the universe, if we don't,

[05:49] then what? Right? And so I see this and this is probably the number one thing that people,

[05:54] when I'm having conversations with them, it's teaching yourself to listen for these language

[05:59] patterns because they are indications of, in my opinion, broken thought patterns. People

[06:05] describe positive negatives, two things without understanding what the deep ramifications of those things

[06:13] are. And so, if you are unhappy, awesome, you're human. This is the human existence. If you are

[06:19] tired, awesome, it will create more contrast for when you are awake. If you are stressed,

[06:26] amazing, it will give you contrast for when you are relaxed. If we constantly want to eliminate

[06:32] one side of the continuum, what often happens is that we get neither side and we become numb

[06:37] to the continuum as a whole. And so we end up missing out on some of the human experience. And

[06:42] that's okay if that's what you want to do, but the reason to making this video is that a lot of

[06:46] people think they have problems that are not actually problems at all. They're just part of being human.

[06:50] And I think the biggest problem that most people have is that they define being human as the

[06:54] problem, which inherently is why they suffer so much. And I'll say something else that was

[06:59] pissing this person off yesterday that I will reinforce with you, which is suffering is optional.

[07:05] And an easy story to reinforce this corner of extreme example of this is if you read a

[07:12] Victor Franco's Man Search for Meaning. And it's a very visceral description if you haven't read it

[07:16] of Auschwitz and the prison camps during World War II. He basically posits in the book. And this is

[07:22] a one-line summary that's doing a massive distrust in justice to the book. That between

[07:28] circumstance and response is choice. And that is the power that all of us have. Even when he was

[07:33] stripped of everything that he possibly could have, he still had choice. And so in that gap is where

[07:39] I believe we find the human experience. We find how we define how we choose to live. It drives me

[07:45] up a wall because I feel like a lot of people suffer because they feel like the way that they're

[07:49] living is somehow wrong or bad or non-optimal or they need to take a pill or an injection to solve

[07:56] being human. And I think if we can simply change our expectations about what being human really

[08:01] means, and I say this passionately because I very much suffered from this free, very long period of time.

[08:07] I was obsessed with being happy. And in being obsessed with being happy any time I was not happy,

[08:13] I saw it as bad rather than a part of being human. And I drove myself nuts. I think I made myself

[08:20] more unhappy. Now, I say this now, not as though the being more unhappy is better good, but I think

[08:25] that most people want to decrease their emotional disturbances that they experience. Right? And so I think

[08:32] a key to not suffering is a understanding that the human experience has peaks and troughs. And it is normal

[08:39] and it is okay. And as a side note, one of the strongest mental health things that I did for myself,

[08:44] I'm not sure if you think that works for me, is that I created a mental refrain, just a simple

[08:49] thing that I can say to myself in my mind over and over and over again, is that when I'm experiencing

[08:53] a negative, quote, here, negative, part of the human experience, I'll say, and that's okay.

[08:59] That's all. But I'm really annoyed right now. I'm like, and that's okay. Rather than then casting

[09:04] judgment on the emotion, because a lot of times you don't have control over your emotions, but you do

[09:08] have control over the judgment with which you apply to the emotion that you experience and the

[09:12] response that you have as a result. And so I think this is where power is formed as humans.

[09:19] Is that some people, two people, are exposed to the same stimulus, right? Same circumstances,

[09:25] and one person person appears and the other person does not. And a lot of it is because of the

[09:29] choices that we make between circumstance and response. And that's kind of back to Victor Frunkliss

[09:34] thing. I'll wrap off this final little thing here, this rant, with a quote from,

[09:39] thank you, is I think it's awkward. He said, wisdom begins with a definition of terms. And so

[09:45] most arguments or disagreements can be resolved if both people come to an agreement on terms. And it's

[09:52] because we say things like happy, we say things like healthy, we say things like wealthy, we say things

[09:59] like success, right? And we haven't defined the terms yet. And then two people will have different

[10:05] definitions of what those terms mean or more likely non-existent definitions, because they've never even

[10:10] thought about it, right? Some amorphous word that they throw out, bucket some general ideas,

[10:15] and disagree. But they have very different definitions of those things. And the way that you define

[10:20] the outcomes that you want to experience will help you achieve them if that is what you so desire.

[10:26] And I think that there's a tremendous amount of wisdom in that concept because, you know,

[10:31] in some practices, quote, because like for example, when we sold our three of the companies that

[10:36] we sold last year, right? Jim will have to be used to lives and now we sold those to different

[10:40] buyers. And what was interesting to me was when I read through the contracts, the first half of like

[10:46] 50 plus page contracts were just defining the terms. And I thought that was just so interesting

[10:51] that in order to come to an agreement, we must first agree on terms, right? What is the scope or

[10:58] territory of a non-compete? And then there would be a paragraph and then that word non-compete

[11:02] would be put somewhere else. And the actual agreements themselves oftentimes are very simplistic.

[11:07] It's like party A as defined by, you know, appendix one, agrees to sell, right?

[11:13] Selling defined in, you know, in appendix two to party B, right? As defined by said asset,

[11:20] said assets defined. You know what I mean? And so what happens is when you become clear about

[11:25] the words you say, you can communicate and think more clearly. And a lot of times, I think that

[11:30] this resolves a lot of the emotional disturbances that we experience as humans because we've realized

[11:34] that they would never problems to begin with only that we define them that way and they're in

[11:39] like the problem of how we experience them. And so this is something very, very passionate about.

[11:44] Hopefully the topic was not as a Morphus as hopefully it sounded to you. But people suffer because

[11:50] they choose to define their experience as suffering. And I think that many of us can experience

[11:56] fewer emotional disturbances or not upgrade them to longstanding emotional disturbances by simply

[12:02] saying, A, I'm experiencing this emotion which will pass comma and it's okay. And B, subset,

[12:09] this is part of being human. And then what happens is we could start redefining what the human

[12:14] experience should be. And if we say, for example, that experiencing the full spectrum of the human

[12:20] experience is a life well lived and we desire to have a life well lived, then we are doing a good thing

[12:26] when we suffer when we are sad, when we are stressed. Because we are living the our life to both

[12:32] extremes at different times in different seasons to the fullest degree so that we can look back on

[12:37] our lives and say, I was a human being, I lived this life. And anyways, these are things that keep me

[12:44] up when I think about what it means to be human. And I think Buddha had a really interesting concept

[12:49] around this which is, you know, he talks about the middle path in life which is, by the way, a lot of

[12:53] people who know this but you know Buddha was a principal forehand so he had all the riches, he had

[12:56] all the comforts, right? And then he went to extreme poverty on the other side of the spectrum.

[13:00] And he was like the middle path, right? So it's understanding both sides of the human experience

[13:04] and not saying either one is good or bad but they just are. And then I think when we do that, we

[13:10] remove the judgment of self which is where a lot of the suffering occurs rather than simply being

[13:15] present for the experience and enjoying it for what it is which is just being human. And we don't fall

[13:20] prey to the narrative of the big farmers that say that being human is wrong, being human is bad,

[13:27] experiencing emotions is not normal. It's the most normal thing. It's the most normal thing

[13:33] for people to be unhappy sometimes. It's the most normal thing for people to be tired, sometimes.

[13:39] It's normal to be hungry. It's normal to be horny. It is part of being human and we create so much

[13:45] suffering for ourselves by saying that there is a problem with simply existing during

[13:50] a period of time on a continuum. And then that problem that we label then becomes long standing

[13:56] rather than something that passes with time. So lots of love everyone.

[14:01] Most of the nation appreciate you if you're new to the channel. Welcome. Lots of love. Keep being

[14:05] awesome. Okay, see you next video. Bye!

[00:00] your speed of decision making is pretty good how clearly you can think.

[00:03] I wanted to make this because I had a really good conversation last week with an entrepreneur

[00:07] and something came up that I know affects all of us.

[00:11] The entrepreneur was dealing with kind of a rocket-a-hard place decision, right?

[00:15] There's two path you could do and apparently there's a cost on either side.

[00:19] Thought this was such an interesting thing because most of the biggest decisions in life

[00:24] are scary because you've already made all the easy decisions that you can make.

[00:28] The only way to make a hard decision and easy decision is to let life make it for you,

[00:32] which is what the vast majority of people do.

[00:34] Things that are obvious and not risky you have already done.

[00:37] What left are the things that are obvious and risky.

[00:40] These types of decisions involve trade-offs.

[00:43] What you're trading is being stuck for either getting better or getting worse, but you're

[00:48] making a trade and you're hoping that obviously gets better.

[00:52] This guy was relatively new to business, he'd been doing business for, called 18 months.

[00:55] One of the things that was a real issue for him is that he was attracting a lot of beginners.

[01:00] The problem was 80% of his revenue was coming from a different set of customers that he didn't

[01:05] like as much, that wasn't as good for the business.

[01:07] What is the apparent conflict, right?

[01:08] Was the apparent trade-off that he has to make here?

[01:10] If we want to get these customers, it means we have to start seeing no to these other ones.

[01:13] But if I see no to these other ones, my revenue is going to go down.

[01:16] So what do I do?

[01:17] What most people do is they just stay there forever and that's it.

[01:20] They just stay stuck and they just do this and look back six years later and nothing is

[01:24] changed in the life because they changed nothing.

[01:26] With this individual, I said, hey, there's a number of things we have to do.

[01:29] One of them is we have to change your ads so that we start messaging the right type

[01:34] of prospect.

[01:35] If you can't say, hey, tired of your job, it's like that's going to attract people with jobs

[01:38] who are tired of their jobs.

[01:39] If you're frustrated with your business, then you're going to have different concerns.

[01:41] And so you wanted to be going after business owners, not consumers.

[01:44] And so it's like, all right, we have to talk in that language.

[01:46] Now, the second thing is see at a book about how he quit his job.

[01:48] I was like, if you're going to write a book, it should be about your business, not your job.

[01:52] Is then you will get people with businesses to have to change the lead magnet.

[01:55] Now, the third thing is it's like, okay, well, you can't also just sell your existing

[01:59] price point because it won't make sense because the cost of getting a business owner

[02:01] computer get it cost of end consumer might be five extra 10 times more than that.

[02:05] So we have to make sure the economics of the business work.

[02:07] Now, if you're thinking about this, you're like, wow, this is a lot of changes.

[02:08] It's like, yeah, it's got to make the trade.

[02:10] Now, the alternative that trade is that he just dissatisfied when I actually spell out both

[02:14] sides on my post shoot.

[02:16] How can I make today feel worse so that tomorrow feels better?

[02:19] And that's what ultimately gets me to make those jumps?

[02:21] And I would love to tell you that the big decisions in my life, I made because I had this

[02:25] big passion pool, this massive vision in front of me.

[02:29] But the reality is most of the time is because my present became so painful for me that

[02:33] I was like, anything is better than this.

[02:35] Even if all of us rewind the clock and think about when we started entrepreneurship, right?

[02:38] Like, you take the leap because you want more freedom and to make more money.

[02:43] But neither of those happen right away.

[02:45] It's kind of one of those like, in order to have an investment pay off, your bank account

[02:48] must go down before it comes up.

[02:50] When you lift weights, your muscles don't get bigger.

[02:52] They get smaller and then bigger.

[02:54] You super compensate.

[02:55] There's usually a step back that must be taken in order to take steps forward.

[02:59] The only guaranteed thing is that if you never take that step back, you will never get

[03:03] the outsized return of taking the steps forward.

[03:05] I think about this because there's so many hard decisions in business.

[03:08] Of course, advertise more.

[03:10] Yeah, dove, we'll do that.

[03:11] But that's not super high risk.

[03:13] Where do these risky decisions come up?

[03:15] It's when you've made all the easy choices.

[03:17] So, if you're like, okay, well, I need to get better people.

[03:20] Okay, we can't just wish for it.

[03:22] So we need to start adding friction into our process.

[03:24] Right?

[03:25] We need to start disqualifying customers.

[03:26] And we have to start qualifying or avatar to the same degree.

[03:30] If we want to raise price because we're like, you know what?

[03:32] I don't have enough good people in my business.

[03:34] It might be a pricing issue.

[03:35] Hear me out.

[03:36] Let's say that you have more demand than you can handle.

[03:39] And you've got a team that's spread thin and you're thinking, okay, I need to increase my

[03:44] team because I have this demand.

[03:46] But I can increase my team because I don't have the money to do it.

[03:49] What's the problem?

[03:51] Well, you've got to step one, raise your price.

[03:54] If you're supply constraint, you've got more than you can handle.

[03:56] Then we can decrease how much is coming in by raising price.

[03:59] By raising price, what's the next thing that happens?

[04:02] Well, now we have more cash flow because we raise the price.

[04:04] We're making more for the same thing that we were doing before.

[04:06] That cash flow does what?

[04:08] It allows you to pay and advertise higher compensation so you can attract the talent you need

[04:12] to get people in so that you can no longer be supply constraint.

[04:16] And so usually there's two or three order consequences that have to happen.

[04:19] Now, each of those have quote risk.

[04:21] But the alternative is what?

[04:23] You stay there.

[04:24] You stay stuck.

[04:25] You're going to spend money knowing that the ROI will go down and you'll make more money.

[04:31] So give an example.

[04:32] So a lot of business owners, especially on the smaller side when they're starting out, maybe

[04:35] there's a 100 bucks a day, a thousand dollars a day, five thousand dollars a day.

[04:38] They get to this arbitrary price point of what they're spending on advertising.

[04:42] They're like, I can't spend beyond that.

[04:44] And reality is that usually the return goes down in terms of relative return, but

[04:49] their absolute return goes up.

[04:52] So let me say differently.

[04:54] If someone said, hey, if you give me $10,000, I can give you $100,000.

[04:59] I'd be like, well, that's a great deal.

[05:00] Am I, can I give you a million dollars with that?

[05:02] And they're like, oh, no, no, no, no.

[05:03] If you give me a million dollars, I can only make you an extra million.

[05:06] And I'm like, wait a second.

[05:07] So if I give you a million, you give me two million.

[05:10] So I make one million in profit.

[05:11] And if I give you 10 grand, you make me a 100 grand, which would you rather do?

[05:16] Don't think about this too long.

[05:19] You want to give the million so you get two million.

[05:20] Why?

[05:21] Because you made a million dollars in profit versus $90,000, which is a profit.

[05:23] And of course, that makes more sense to do that.

[05:24] But the thing is the relative return will be lower.

[05:26] That little note that is especially common.

[05:29] In small business, I used to work with, I mean, obviously with gyms, right?

[05:32] What happened a lot of times is a gym owner would cap their spend, right?

[05:36] So I'll give you how this would work.

[05:38] So let's say that in order for them to cover all the costs in the gym, they need to sign

[05:42] up X number of members per month.

[05:45] What they would do is spend as little as possible to get those X members.

[05:50] And then be like, okay, I broke even.

[05:52] But I can't spend more money because I'm breaking even.

[05:55] It's like, dude, you have to spend more money because you're getting to break even on

[05:59] that spend.

[06:00] Everything above that is the gravy.

[06:02] But people because they downregulate their goals based on the difficulty of achieving

[06:06] them.

[06:07] So the tactical perspective, something that has given me such outsized returns in my life

[06:11] is actually spilling out the trade.

[06:15] Spell out the trade.

[06:16] I talked to a lady last week who had a bunch of businesses.

[06:18] And so she had five different businesses that she was running and she was doing like a

[06:21] million or two million dollars a year.

[06:22] Whatever.

[06:23] When I talked to her about it, she's like, the other problem is like, I can grow things

[06:25] but I get really bored really quickly.

[06:27] And I was like, okay, well, first off, there's nothing wrong with that.

[06:31] And I super mean this because I'm not the should guy.

[06:33] I'm not that you should do this.

[06:34] You should do that.

[06:35] You should do that.

[06:36] You should do that.

[08:50] You should do that.

[08:51] You should do that.

[08:52] You should do that.

[08:53] You should do that.

[08:54] You should do that.

[08:55] You should do that.

[08:56] You should do that.

[08:57] You should do that.

[08:58] You should do that.

[08:59] You should do that.

[09:00] You should do that.

[09:01] There we go.

[09:02] Pro in the tree.

[09:03] They're not willing to cut the branches off to let the whole thing grow.

[09:05] Back to the original owner that I thought I was talking about the very beginning.

[09:07] When I have my conversation with him, it became clear that this is what he ultimately

[09:11] wanted to have.

[09:12] And so when I've been able to convince business owners to do the thing the ultimately

[09:15] want to do, it's just spelling out what my trade is.

[09:18] No, that when you have hard decisions in front of you, there's nothing wrong with that.

[09:22] It means if anything, you've picked all the easy paths.

[09:24] You've already cut the low hanging fruit off.

[09:26] You've already made the easy ones that have almost no trade off or the tradeoffs are

[09:29] so obvious or benign that you're like obvious to make the trade.

[09:32] But what happens later is you get to real irreversible decisions you have or rather difficult

[09:36] to reverse decisions.

[09:37] That point you have to put your big boy pants on and say, I got to make a trade.

[09:41] Because the only thing that is guaranteed is that if you want everything from my if you will get nothing,

[09:45] that's my little message of the day.

[09:46] The hard choices that you have are hard because you've used up all your easy decisions already.

[09:51] And wishing that they were easier does not make them easier.

[09:54] And you've got to pick and you've got to live with the consequences.

[09:57] And I will say this, the more irreversible decisions you make, the better you get it making them.

[10:01] But you got to start.

[10:02] So that's it.

[10:04] Rock and roll.

[10:05] Appreciate you.

[10:06] Talk to you today.

[10:07] I don't know what that means.

[10:08] We just go for it.

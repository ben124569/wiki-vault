## Full Transcript
[00:00] I got 10,000 people to promote my next book, $100 million leads, absolutely free.

[00:05] And to give you a visual of that, that's like an entire stadium full of people promoting your thing.

[00:09] And now imagine those people leaving that stadium and then entering their own individual stadiums and shouting, you like,

[00:14] go check this thing out.

[00:15] And the best part is it's absolutely free.

[00:17] I was thinking myself like, well, it would be the craziest way that I could launch this book to make a big fanfare about it.

[00:21] Because my first book, $100 million offers was all about making a crazy offer to people.

[00:25] I didn't.

[00:25] Making an offer so good, people feel stupid saying, no.

[00:27] And I tried to make the book a meta example of the concept within the book.

[00:31] I talked about having elements to enhance the offer, having a big price development see.

[00:35] And so I offer the book for 99 cents, but included a course which most people would charge $1000 for.

[00:40] Absolutely free without even asking people to opt in for it.

[00:42] All of this was just to demonstrate the value equation which was the core concept of that book.

[00:46] Now, my $100 million leads book is a different book.

[00:48] It's about advertising in order to get leads.

[00:50] And so I was like, okay, well, if I wanted to demonstrate all the concepts in that book,

[00:54] I'd have to do something totally different than how I did with offers.

[00:57] And so with this, I was like, well, how do I show that I can get lots of leads with a book?

[01:01] And so I was like, I'm going to hold a big book event.

[01:04] So I'm going to hold a book launch event that's me virtual and it's going to be free and everyone's invited.

[01:08] And I'm going to see how many people I can get to this thing.

[01:10] And I'm not going to do it the way I could do it, which would just be like, I could post on my social media.

[01:15] I probably get plenty of people to go.

[01:16] I wanted to use every single one of the methods I talk about in the book to promote the book itself.

[01:22] And one of those methods is called affiliate marketing.

[01:24] And so the way that I actually did this in the real world was that we created.

[01:27] An affiliate opt-in, which was just put your name, your email, your phone,

[01:30] and then what we would give them is a unique URL.

[01:33] So a custom link that if someone clicked their link, it would take them to the leads opt-in page for the event.

[01:38] But it would be tracked back to them.

[01:39] And then the top 10 affiliates, I said, I would hop on a live Q&A call with their audience if they won.

[01:46] And they were the top 10 is anyone who got at least 10 people to show up to the event.

[01:49] I would give two bonus chapters for my book that I'm not going to release with the book as an added benefit.

[01:54] And we think about this is because I want to incentivize the highest affiliates to promote the most and be competitive.

[02:00] But I don't want somebody who has like 100-person email list to think, oh, I'm never going to win that.

[02:05] Why bother?

[02:06] Well, there's also a prize that everyone can win.

[02:08] There's scarcity at the top, but then just a tiny hurdle for everyone, which is actually one of the strategies I talk about when creating an affiliate compensation system.

[02:15] Because it actually works the same way whether you're promoting an event or supplements or widgets or services.

[02:20] It all works the same way.

[02:21] So inside this video, I'm going to talk about who to pick, to affiliate with, how to onboard them properly and set expectations,

[02:27] how to get them to start advertising and how to keep them advertising along the way.

[02:31] And a little bonus of how to structure that off.

[02:33] All right, so the first thing that you have to figure out when you're creating an affiliate strategy or influencer strategies,

[02:38] who's the ideal affiliate?

[02:39] One of the more advanced advertising strategies is that you actually have two customers now.

[02:43] You have your affiliate avatar and then you have your customer avatar.

[02:47] So now it means that you have to deliver to two types of people rather than one.

[02:49] And that's where it gets more complicated if you're starting out.

[02:52] That being said, there's different ways of doing this in different industries.

[02:54] For example, if I'm a brick and mortar business, my affiliate strategy is, let's say I'm a massage person.

[02:59] I could then go and say, okay, what are all the big businesses in the area and say, okay, these guys hire 10 new employees a week to big corporation.

[03:06] I say, hey, Mr. Corporation, I want to give each of your new employees two free massages on the house.

[03:10] Here's a coupon. You can give it to them in their new employee packet.

[03:13] Why would that business say no to giving their employees some sort of treat?

[03:16] And for me, I'm happy to just get new customers.

[03:18] And if I make that partnership now with 10 or 100 companies, then I'm going to be able to fill up my books.

[03:23] And how much did that cost me advertising?

[03:25] Literally only the effort to reach out to them and make the ask.

[03:27] Right? And so you have with an affiliate strategy, two levels of offers.

[03:31] What's the offer you're going to make them?

[03:32] And then what's the offer they're going to make on your behalf to their customers?

[03:35] Right? And so the two free massages is my, is my offer to their customer,

[03:40] which in this place is an employee, which totally underrated strategy,

[03:43] because they'll never see you as competition.

[03:45] But then also, why am I going to make this offer to the employer?

[03:48] The offer to them is your employees will like you more and have a better onboard experience and be

[03:51] distressed by having this thing.

[03:52] You'll be perceived as a more caring employer.

[03:54] That's the offer.

[03:55] I don't need to like incentivize them and pay them or do anything like that,

[03:58] because it's in their best interest.

[03:59] To the same degree, if I'm still that massage therapist,

[04:01] I might go to a car tractor and say, hey, some of your people get their backs cracked

[04:04] and they probably need someone to massage.

[04:06] Anybody who gets their back cracked with you, I'll give them a massage on the house.

[04:09] And then all of a sudden, that car tractor gets 15 new patients a month.

[04:12] We'll send you a certain percentage of those patients.

[04:14] Now, you could also even pay them on top of that to further incentivize them.

[04:17] But typically, if you do a really good job and you establish a relationship,

[04:20] they'll start doing that.

[04:21] And if you're really smart about it, you'll start referring them business too.

[04:24] And then that is where you really start the machine going.

[04:26] That's a brick and mortar example.

[04:27] And influencer examples, probably most people are used to, which is like, hey,

[04:31] use my discount code for 10% off.

[04:33] And then the influencer gets some kickback.

[04:36] Now, sometimes that's just a straight endorsement.

[04:37] You pay them to post, which is much more like paid advertising.

[04:40] Or you do some sort of split based on what they bring you,

[04:42] which is much closer to affiliate advertising,

[04:44] which is what I'm talking about.

[04:45] A third version of this is the main way that I used to market this book,

[04:49] which is affiliate marketing, which is much more common in the internet marketing world.

[04:53] This covers a huge amount of people who have lists and audiences that they have trust with.

[04:58] What you have to do is say, hey, you will gain trust with your audience.

[05:01] The trade is that sometimes they do lose trust with their audience,

[05:04] which is why people pay to get affiliates.

[05:07] Ultimately, your brand matters a lot with why they would trust their customers.

[05:12] And they're goodwill with you.

[05:14] And so the reason in my opinion that the book launch, which is not here,

[05:17] but the pretend I have my book right here, has gone well using the strategy,

[05:20] is that many people in my audience trust that I'm going to over-deliver,

[05:24] which I absolutely am, to their audience.

[05:26] And so their audience will then associate the value they get from me with them.

[05:30] And so it's almost like them getting free goodwill by promoting my stuff, right?

[05:34] And that's what you want.

[05:35] The crazy part about the affiliate strategy that I'm going to outline for you is that I actually have zero financial incentive,

[05:39] which is not common.

[05:40] Most of the time, if you go to a social media, you know, you get some influence,

[05:43] or you're like, hey, will you promote my supplement brand?

[05:46] They're like, well, what's my split, right?

[05:47] Because they're like, I'm going to be taking some goodwill out of my audience,

[05:50] so I need to be compensated for that.

[05:51] But if you have such goodwill, you might do it for free.

[05:54] If you actually thought that it was good.

[05:56] I mean, think about when a friend of yours is like, hey, what pair of shoes are those?

[05:59] You're like, oh, I love these shoes, or I love this bag, whatever it is.

[06:01] You're being in affiliate, just in a micro, with your micro influence,

[06:04] to that business.

[06:05] And you do it because you feel like you will actually gain in relational capital,

[06:09] because that person will go, by the shoes, use the shoes, love the shoes,

[06:12] tell you about it, associate with you.

[06:13] That's why you do it.

[06:14] You feel like it's trying to do that I online for my process was simple.

[06:17] I have two layers of affiliates, and I think this is useful for anyone

[06:20] when you're thinking about your products or your business.

[06:22] Is that I've got my super affiliate level, and then I've got regular affiliates.

[06:25] The key difference is that I like to have two polar opposite strategies.

[06:28] The people who are super affiliates have big audiences, and they tend to be competitive,

[06:32] more status driven, et cetera.

[06:33] And so I want to align with they want, which is status, with what I want, which is people.

[06:38] I decided to do, we say, hey, and this is going to be pretty key to them.

[06:41] I haven't explained this publicly yet, so you know, enjoy.

[06:44] I said the top 10 will get an AMA live with me to their audience.

[06:49] Now, here's why this is unique and different.

[06:51] One, I have a very small supply of time, like I don't speak in public very much.

[06:56] I think in the last year of companies that I don't own, I've done one speech.

[07:00] I try and limit my supply of time that I'm available to other people's audiences.

[07:04] Imagine you're now in the audience of this super affiliate,

[07:06] and he says, hey, register for this book of it.

[07:09] Now, if I'm the customer or that person's audience, I think, what's in it for me?

[07:12] Why don't I just go to Alex's thing rather than clicking your link?

[07:15] Or why do I click your link for someone else's?

[07:17] Well, here's why.

[07:18] This benefits them.

[07:20] So if I'm the affiliate, I say, hey, click my link so that our community can have the prize.

[07:25] Rather than me saying, hey, the top 10 affiliates get super cars.

[07:28] Right? Because why does that benefit their audience?

[07:30] Because if I did it exactly that, hey, let me help me win my contest that is with drawing from their audience.

[07:35] But if I do it this way, then I can say, hey, I actually want to support you in your audience.

[07:39] And that way, when you make this email to your list, it doesn't cost you anything.

[07:42] And so that's why I engineered it this way so that this is just goodwill, they gain.

[07:46] And the reason why is aligned so that their incentive mindset of and the audiences,

[07:50] then are all my tours the same outcome, which is to get the click and it's out of for the event.

[07:54] So whenever you're making something for any affiliate, you want to align all of the incentives to the greatest degree possible.

[07:59] Now, when you say, I'm just going to pay them, that it lines your incentive and their incentive,

[08:03] but not the audiences incentive.

[08:04] And so the more aligned incentives you get, the bigger the outcome.

[08:06] Now, the second level is regular fillet.

[08:08] So if you're like, okay, well, right now, I think the top, the top people all have like a thousand people that they've sent over to the book launch for us.

[08:16] And so if you have a thousand total followers, the likelihood that you're going to send all thousand is probably pretty low.

[08:21] And so you might be like, well, why even bother?

[08:23] So you have to answer that question, which is why I have the second tier.

[08:25] So why bother even affiliated and begin with?

[08:27] Why bother even promoting this?

[08:29] I said, if you get more than 10 to show up to the event, just 10 people.

[08:33] And if you have an email list or you have any following whatsoever, even if you don't have any of those things,

[08:36] you just know 10 people who you think it would be valuable.

[08:38] You don't have to have any marketing skills to get 10 people to a thing.

[08:41] And the reason you would do it, remember a lot in incentives, is that they trust that if I say, hey,

[08:45] this is going to be worth it.

[08:46] I'm going to deliver on that.

[08:47] And the reason they might be able or willing to make that bet is because if I've said it in the past that it would be worth it,

[08:52] I've delivered on that.

[08:53] And so give you a bit of context, I've only emailed my list.

[08:56] I think like three or four times in the past year.

[08:58] And I've made a lot of content.

[09:00] We put out 250 week, 1,000 pieces of content a month.

[09:03] So 12,000 a year, roughly in terms of pieces of content.

[09:06] And only four pieces of content that I say, I think you guys should go check this out.

[09:09] It's worth the time.

[09:10] Right?

[09:10] Not to say I don't think the other time is worth it.

[09:12] But if I'm going to make the ask, I want to make sure that whatever they get is foreign access.

[09:17] Because let's say every piece of content, 80% of people think it's good and 20% of people think it's mid,

[09:21] whatever.

[09:22] Okay.

[09:22] But if I know that 99% of people are going to believe that it's going to be amazing,

[09:25] then that's when we're either low risk of saying, hey,

[09:28] you're going to get more than your time by doing this or by watching this.

[09:31] And so from the big picture perspective when you're promoting this,

[09:33] you don't want to like smash everyone all at once the whole time.

[09:36] Because then people get sick of you, right?

[09:37] The best analogy I've heard from this is something called whisper T-Shout.

[09:40] And I heard this somewhere at some event and I don't know who originally came up with it,

[09:44] but I just love this.

[09:45] Got whisper T-Shout.

[09:46] And this is really like the three phases of promoting anything.

[09:49] So whisper is where you drip 80 bit like not even hints.

[09:53] You're just building anticipation.

[09:55] And so this is like the Godzilla scene and the movie theaters.

[09:58] That's just like the foot.

[09:59] And it just says May 2025, right?

[10:02] And so they don't tell you the plot.

[10:04] There's no character development.

[10:05] It's just enough to get you excited.

[10:08] That's all it is.

[10:08] Within the context of this book, over the last two years,

[10:12] I've just been sprinkling little stories.

[10:14] Maybe like up another day of writing.

[10:16] Now like just, oh, got another thing.

[10:18] I got something good for it.

[10:19] Like, and I'm just showing just not a lot.

[10:21] Not saying what's inside of it.

[10:22] Not talking at all about the contents.

[10:24] Just saying I'm writing a book and it's going to be good.

[10:27] You guys are going to love it.

[10:28] Right?

[10:28] And showing the work.

[10:29] Because let me give you a quick example on this.

[10:31] Is that if I said, I spent two years making this 10 minute video.

[10:35] How likely would it be that you think that video was good?

[10:38] Compared to, I said, hey, I spent two hours on this 10 minute video.

[10:41] You probably be way more likely to watch the 10 minute video

[10:45] that I spent two years working on.

[10:46] And so the same thing worse with whatever projects you want to sell.

[10:49] They'll further out.

[10:50] You can show them that you're working on this thing.

[10:51] The more they'll believe that you have invested in it.

[10:53] And I learned this from our early mentor mind.

[10:55] He said, the key to making it a big deal is to make it a big deal.

[10:59] And so like it doesn't matter what you're doing.

[11:01] If you tell people that something's a big deal, then they will believe that it's a big deal.

[11:04] And so I can't say it more simply.

[11:06] And so if I show you that I've been working on this for two years, then when I say

[11:10] it's finally ready, people will be like, wow, he's worked a long time on this.

[11:13] I want to check it out.

[11:14] So you build curiosity.

[11:15] Here, we transition to the T-space.

[11:17] Let me walk you through.

[11:18] So phase one is six weeks plus out.

[11:21] That means like three months out, 12 months, two years out.

[11:24] You're just whispering.

[11:25] It's all we're doing here.

[11:26] Then we get into teasing.

[11:27] So this is where you peel back a corner of the page and you show one page where you do a

[11:33] reading of a paragraph or you make videos about some of the content.

[11:37] That's inside the book.

[11:38] Now you don't show the whole thing.

[11:39] You just zoom in on a little bit.

[11:41] Just to clip just a little something something.

[11:43] So they're like, oh, now I have a prediction of what type of value I'm going to get from this thing.

[11:48] Now you're looking at the trailer.

[11:50] That's 30 seconds long.

[11:51] That has a couple dinosaurs running in and out.

[11:53] Really cool.

[11:54] There's action in this.

[11:55] Like, you get a general direction of what this movie is going to be about.

[11:58] This is six weeks to seven days.

[12:01] Then you transition to shout.

[12:02] Shout is the last seven days leading up into the thing.

[12:05] At this point, you're not whispering.

[12:07] You're not teasing.

[12:08] You're not hinting.

[12:09] You're like, this is the thing.

[12:10] It's going to be awesome.

[12:11] Be there.

[12:12] And most of this is reminders.

[12:14] A big part that most people mess up.

[12:15] And this is what I see a lot of marketers do overall.

[12:17] They spend six weeks shouting.

[12:19] People literally get bored of your thing before you even happens because you've talked about it so much.

[12:23] So that's number one.

[12:24] And you want it to be a, you want it to feel like this.

[12:26] It's like intermittent, intermittent, more frequent.

[12:28] And then you can trend it up into whatever the event is.

[12:31] And you get big, lots of money.

[12:33] There you go.

[12:34] When we're in the shout phase, how effective you are at the shout is actually predicted by

[12:40] everything you did before that.

[12:42] And so it happens is, most people don't provide enough value before they say, hey, I've got my thing.

[12:46] And so what they have to do is they start having to artificially create value and increase

[12:50] their content frequency.

[12:51] In order to approximate having provided value beforehand.

[12:55] And so they try and provide value and ask and provide value and ask at the same time.

[12:59] And it just looks disjoined it because they don't have any good will to withdraw from.

[13:02] And so then they ask in shout even harder and louder until eventually no one listens to them.

[13:06] And you don't want that.

[13:07] We want to be really careful about when we're shouting.

[13:08] It is super effective, but then you burn it out quickly.

[13:11] And so you want to use it right here.

[13:13] So at least to the event during the whisper and T's phase.

[13:16] And this is something that my brain director and I Caleb had a long discussion about,

[13:20] which is during these time periods, are we going to only talk about the book?

[13:23] It's like, well, no, what about during the T's phase?

[13:25] Are we only going to talk about the book?

[13:26] No, we're going to still provide value.

[13:28] The exact same way we have it in the exact same volume we have been.

[13:32] And then added it on top.

[13:33] So think about that.

[13:34] You're like, wait, that sounds like more work.

[13:35] Sure is.

[13:36] My team's behind the camera is sweating.

[13:39] The idea there was that why would I want to decrease the value that I'm providing my audience.

[13:44] During the time when I want to ask them to do something even more.

[13:47] Like, no, not only do I want to make sure that I'm providing my regular value, which

[13:51] is about business content in general, growing businesses, scaling sales, marketing, etc.

[13:54] But then I also want to talk about the book.

[13:56] And if you want to be clever with it, whenever you're making your advertisements, because

[14:00] this is an advertisement.

[14:01] It just means making other people know about your stuff.

[14:03] That's what I'm doing.

[14:04] You want to still make sure that the advertisement itself is still valuable.

[14:07] Like, who here likes going to the movie theater and then watching the trailers?

[14:10] I love watching the trailers before moving.

[14:12] Like, I'm bummed if I don't get the first 15 minutes before the movie.

[14:15] Why?

[14:16] Because they are valuable.

[14:17] Like, watching them.

[14:18] And so there is a reason they design them that way.

[14:19] People share trailers.

[14:21] Why?

[14:22] Because it's valuable.

[14:23] And if you share the trailer, what did it do?

[14:24] You've got more people to find out about it, which is why well-designed advertisements provide

[14:28] value to the person and let them know about the thing.

[14:31] That's the magic.

[14:32] Throughout this whole process, if you think about value as this line, this is constant.

[14:35] All the way through.

[14:36] It's unchanging.

[14:37] All right.

[14:38] So we're providing value the whole time.

[14:39] And then we sprinkle in whisper, whisper, then we start showing more details about what

[14:43] they're going to find out the value that they're going to get.

[14:45] And then we remind we remind we remind we remind until the event.

[14:48] Meanwhile, still posting value, still adding to the audience so that each of these hit because

[14:53] think about this.

[14:54] Every day, you have new people who come into your world.

[14:57] And they don't have two years of goodwill.

[14:59] So I have probably more people coming into my world right now because so many more people

[15:02] are promoting my book that I actually have to deliver more value than I ever have because

[15:06] I have so many new people who are now going to find out about my stuff.

[15:09] And what a shame it would be if they enter my world.

[15:11] And then the only thing they have is a smash for me saying, go grab something, go check

[15:16] out my virtual event.

[15:18] So I have to be delivering in higher amounts because I have more people than ever who

[15:22] are seeing your stuff.

[15:23] That's the idea.

[15:24] And that is the whole concept between the three phase attack of whisper, tease, shout.

[15:28] And for everyone who wants to use paid influencers, paid affiliates, endorsements, I have tons

[15:33] of money examples, costs and returns, how to calculate it, how to set what percentages

[15:37] for what tiers of affiliates, how to set up multiple tiers, how much you buy, I put

[15:40] in each one.

[15:41] Have all of those in all the best practices that I've used inside of here.

[15:43] I didn't want to include it in this video, not because I don't want to share it because

[15:46] I think a lot of people would get lost in the numbers and you probably want to read and

[15:49] reread it again in front of you, which is why it's in the books.

[15:51] If this is interesting and you're like, man, I would love to find a way that other businesses

[15:54] could advertise my stuff or might be half and do it for free or do it only after I've

[15:58] made money.

[15:59] So there's no risk to me, then affiliates are your play.

[16:02] So let's talk about the actual mechanics of this.

[16:04] So for me, because I didn't have to pay out, it became significantly easier for me to get

[16:09] affiliates, all right?

[16:11] Because typically when you have an affiliate, there's two ways to do it.

[16:14] You can have paid and unpaid.

[16:15] So pay to fill in, it's either pay them with money or you scratch their back, they scratch

[16:19] your back, right?

[16:20] This is the collab, this is the upper might your thing if you promote my thing.

[16:23] Now for me, I don't feel confident that I could promote a lot of my affiliate stuff,

[16:26] just being really candid because I don't know if it necessarily at that level yet or

[16:29] I wouldn't risk the trust that I have built with my audience, just being very candid.

[16:32] But they're not asking me to do that.

[16:34] So that's okay.

[16:35] Now on the unpaid side, they have to get other things and that's where I'm adding those extra

[16:39] bonuses in in order to get them to want to do it.

[16:41] When you have a paid affiliate, you have to get them to fill out all these forms, taxes,

[16:47] so that you can pay them and they can be seen as, I don't even remember what it is.

[16:51] Maybe it's a K1 or 1099.

[16:52] I don't think it's a 1099.

[16:53] They get a 1099 from your company because they all have sent you money and then you

[16:57] have to send them money back and there's all these forms you have to have them fill out.

[17:00] Now, the good thing with this is that if someone goes through the trouble of doing this,

[17:03] the likelihood that they want to promote it significantly higher.

[17:05] So there are benefits this.

[17:06] If I'm going to beat a B business all day long, I want to have a little bit of money

[17:09] for that.

[17:10] One more friction, I want to qualify the affiliates.

[17:11] I want to make sure that they're sitting the right types of people to whatever it is that

[17:14] I have, especially from selling services.

[17:16] Now, I have a book which is delivered without my time.

[17:19] And so I'm willing to forego some of the friction that I would normally put at the B to B business

[17:23] in order to get more scale and volume in a B to C scenario.

[17:26] So for here, the way the opt-in form worked for our affiliate campaign, if you want to check

[17:32] it out, you can go to acquisition.com for slash affiliate.

[17:35] What you'll see is, was your first name, last name, email, phone, and that's it.

[17:39] And you'll see a button.

[17:40] When they clicked that, the thank you page and we did it in two ways.

[17:42] The thank you page has there now custom link that they can use to promote your thing.

[17:46] And they get an email because sometimes people lose their their own screenshot or whatever

[17:49] that also has a copy of that.

[17:50] This sounds like tiny stuff, but sometimes like the extra email or putting on the thank

[17:54] you page makes a 25% difference in the amount of people who promote your stuff.

[17:58] And as a side benefit here, we actually changed the banner on top of the submit form

[18:03] and increase the amount of affiliates who decided to sign up on the opt-in page by 60%.

[18:07] And so little things can still make huge differences in the campaign, which is why I'm

[18:11] sharing these tiny details with you.

[18:13] Now when you want the affiliates to sign up, if you want volume, you make it easier,

[18:16] if you want quality, you make it harder.

[18:18] And the push pool in business is figuring out where the sweet spot is for your products at

[18:22] your price point.

[18:23] I'm going really mass market for a book, which is considered probably a pretty cheap

[18:27] thing.

[18:28] And so I can go all the way on this side and then I'm trying to make this as easy,

[18:31] seemingly possible.

[18:32] So like how long does it take to sign up to be an affiliate of the book 30 seconds?

[18:36] And literally someone could go 30 seconds and then make a story on social media and immediately

[18:39] share it and get leads.

[18:41] So I made it really low time to lighten the value equation.

[18:44] We can still apply it to every step in this whole process.

[18:46] So the value is they become an affiliate.

[18:48] The time to light is 30 seconds.

[18:50] The effort and sacrifices they type their stuff in.

[18:52] And the perceived likelihood it works is they click submit.

[18:54] And if it works, they're done.

[18:55] So we still apply the same for variables to every step in this process to get the most amount

[18:59] of people to promote your stuff.

[19:00] Now, from your promotional aspects, there are two big promotions that you'll be running

[19:05] concurrently.

[19:06] Again, remember I said there's two types of customers?

[19:07] Well, that means that I'm running marketing campaigns to the customers who I want to

[19:10] show up to the event.

[19:11] And I'm also now running campaigns to the affiliates to remind them to promote the vet.

[19:16] Because once you get the affiliate, that's the easy part.

[19:18] The hard part is getting them to advertise your thing.

[19:20] And so this is where reminders, reachouts, like tokens, here's Starbucks, just getting them

[19:27] engaged, messaging them to remind them to keep doing it.

[19:30] Because the thing is, if they promote it once, it'll hop a little bit.

[19:33] But if they promote it consistently throughout the whole time, they're all in.

[19:37] And the depth that you will get with their audience, because their audience will see that

[19:40] they are bought in, you will carry on some of that trust when you make your offer for whatever

[19:45] it is.

[19:46] So one of the important things is that I have a big list of people who are going to the event.

[19:49] And so I said, hey, it would mean the world to me if you shared this event with your audience.

[19:53] So I sent two emails to that big list.

[19:55] I've thrown those two emails.

[19:56] We've got 9,000 people to say they wanted to register.

[19:58] Now, I share my story and share it in other places.

[20:01] But the majority of that came from my email list, who decided to become affiliates and promote

[20:05] it to their audiences.

[20:06] Here's a mistake that a lot of people make.

[20:08] Is that they will then keep messaging the audience that's supposed to show up to the

[20:12] event to promote the event and then they lose goodwill in that audience.

[20:15] And so I have to do two max, three advertisements over the entire length of whatever

[20:20] your campaign is to let them note that the opportunity exists.

[20:24] Even within those messages, I assume that my customers are going to be the vast majority

[20:28] of people are going to read this.

[20:29] So be smart about what you're saying.

[20:31] Don't be like, oh man, we're going to sell a shitload of books here, right?

[20:34] You can't say that, right?

[20:36] Because your customers are like, that's how he sees me, right?

[20:39] And you don't want that.

[20:40] And so the idea is like, this is going to be an amazing event.

[20:42] You want to continue to edify the event and follow the same messaging buckets that you would

[20:45] about the main thing.

[20:47] But then tie in the Wyatt ties to the mission for them to also support you in the whole cause

[20:51] overall.

[20:52] And then once we sent two emails, that created 9,000.

[20:55] And then once they get onto that list, then they've given you permission to give them way

[20:59] more information.

[21:00] But even then, I tend to just because probably my communication style in general, I tend

[21:03] to communicate thoroughly, but not as frequently.

[21:07] Like some people want to email every day, that's not my vibe.

[21:09] And so every week and we set the expectation up front, you will get two emails a week from

[21:13] me from now until the day of the thick.

[21:15] And that way they can think, okay, there's five weeks I'm going to get 10 emails from

[21:18] them.

[21:19] And then what I do want to make my promises, I keep my promises.

[21:21] So I say the first email is going to be more content that you can then use because I'm

[21:25] going to give them stuff in real time.

[21:26] Now, what did we do with the content?

[21:27] I told you I gave them the black book.

[21:28] Was there any more stuff?

[21:29] Of course there was.

[21:30] But I didn't give it up front because I knew that everybody's going to take that stuff because

[21:33] now that's their insider intel that shows that they have more inside knowledge than anyone

[21:37] else does, which is why people click their link and also give them stronger brain association.

[21:40] But then three weeks in, I'm going to give them another big packet of stuff that they

[21:44] can then use.

[21:45] So that I can guarantee that their ads don't get stale as they promote my thing, just like

[21:49] I would for myself.

[21:50] I would not not give them that same advantage because I want them to move in it.

[21:53] And I want it to work two emails a week, one with the content and the other with the

[21:56] update of where they stand because a lot of people are like, well, where am I?

[21:59] How many do I have?

[22:00] And this is the part that a lot of people don't get.

[22:01] It's like, you have to give them tracking back.

[22:03] Now, the more advanced you are as an affiliate, marketer and people who manage networks of

[22:07] affiliates, sometimes you need to have back and tie in so they can get pixel fires and all

[22:10] sort of stuff.

[22:11] Now, for me, because of the nature of this event, I didn't mess with any of that because

[22:14] I wanted to make it very easy, very light lift for all the affiliates.

[22:16] And I wanted to be more on goodwill and if they're aligned with the cause, more than because

[22:19] they're trying to get a paycheck.

[22:20] The right affiliates are also stoked about the thing.

[22:23] This is a piece that a lot of people miss when they do this.

[22:25] If you just try to get people for the money, that means you've hired mercenaries.

[22:29] If you get people for the cause, you've hired missionaries.

[22:31] And you want missionaries not mercenaries because mercenaries will just go to the next person

[22:35] who is the highest bidder and then you basically have a reverse race to the bottom.

[22:38] You've erased the top in terms of how much you're willing to pay them to promote your

[22:41] thing, which is not a type of business that I want to be in.

[22:44] And so I'd rather say, hey, you're not going to get anything, but you're going to get

[22:46] all this goodwill.

[22:47] And if you're associated with that or you want to associate with that, then here's a way

[22:50] to do it that's fastened easy.

[22:52] And so we provide them even more value than the people who are on the list in their sphere.

[22:57] Like it's not as more value, it's different value that they would find interesting.

[23:00] Like me explaining how I'm doing this affiliate thing is valuable for them so that they can

[23:04] use it on their own stuff.

[23:05] Because these are all marketers and promoters in their own right, have their own businesses.

[23:08] And so for them, half the value is seeing what I'm doing behind the scenes so that they

[23:11] can employ themselves.

[23:12] I'll bet you, a third of the list of the 9,000 are just want to see what I'm doing.

[23:16] And I'm not even planning to promote it at all.

[23:18] And that's okay.

[23:19] I'll find it that.

[23:20] But by the way, if you are going to promote the TLDR here is provide value to them just

[23:23] like you would a customer give them stats of where they're at.

[23:25] Be consistent with whatever promises you make.

[23:27] Be upfront about the expectations that you have of them and what expectations they can

[23:31] have of you and then stick to those.

[23:33] And then the last week, the last few days, a couple extra reminders and then you're on.

[23:37] And then after that, you announce the winners and you give them the prizes that you promised.

[23:41] And when you choreograph all that together, you might be like, man, that's a lot of work.

[23:44] Yeah.

[23:45] But so is so valuable is having 9,000 other people promoting your stuff for you.

[23:48] Because if you think about it the end of the day, there's two people who can promote what

[23:51] you have.

[23:52] You and other people.

[23:54] And there are more of them than there are of you.

[23:55] There's a lot of people in the world.

[23:57] And there's a lot of people who don't know who you are.

[23:58] And so if you can find a way to make it a win-win win, you unlock as much traffic as you

[24:03] want for whatever it is you're trying to sell.

[24:05] And so the win-win win, because I'm going to say this against nothing is important, is that

[24:08] you have to win, the affiliate has to win, and most importantly, their audience has to win.

[24:13] And if you can show them that their audience wins by them associating with you, you will

[24:17] unlock the door size as much promotion as you want.

[24:19] And the coolest part, and I'm saying this again, is that this is absolutely free.

[24:23] Anyone can do this and all you do is you lead with value.

[24:25] And you have to remember that you now have two customers.

[24:27] You have your affiliates that you have to make offers to and deliver on and market to and

[24:31] provide value to.

[24:32] And you have the customers yours and their customers that you know have to deliver on.

[24:36] And I will tell you this, the standards that the affiliates will have for how you treat

[24:39] their customers will be even higher than how you treat your customers.

[24:42] And the main thing is is because everybody thinks they treat their customers better than

[24:45] they really do.

[24:46] And so they expect anyone else to treat them with the utmost respect and care.

[24:49] Having affiliates forces you to raise your own standards for how you, how good you are

[24:53] at messaging and advertising in general, which is one of the things I kind of like about

[24:56] it, because it gives me a little bit more pressure to keep over delivering.

[24:59] And I will tell you that there are a couple things that I made, a couple of tweaks that

[25:02] I made to how we're promoting the book that I only made after some of my closest friends

[25:06] were like, dude, I'm going to be pushing this to my whole audience.

[25:08] And I was like, I need to say this differently.

[25:10] I need to word this differently.

[25:11] And these tiny tweaks that I think will give huge out, huge outcomes for us and them.

[25:15] But I wouldn't have done if I didn't have that next level of pressure.

[25:18] And so that is the complete behind the scenes of affiliate guide of how I promoted this book,

[25:24] $100,000, and maybe by the time you see this, we'll be at $10,000.

[25:27] And real quick, if you have an audience that's big or small and you've enjoyed the content

[25:32] or you enjoy the last book and you think that your audience or your friends would enjoy

[25:36] the next book, then you can go register and actually promote it at acquisition.com

[25:39] for your audience.

[25:40] And there's no financial incentive and you can tell your audience that you have no financial

[25:43] incentive for doing it.

[25:44] And the idea is that if they click your link, you might enter to win.

[25:47] But I forgot to say the last little secret, which is that if you just get over 10 people

[25:51] to the event, I'll give you two bonus chapters that I'm not going to release in the book.

[25:55] Just for every single person who brings 10 people to the event, because it means so

[25:57] much to me that I didn't put the value in the book, just to give it to you guys because

[26:02] I knew that I wanted this to be special and I wanted to demonstrate what I say in the

[26:05] book in real life.

[26:06] And now that you understand the affiliate strategy that I'm using to promote $100 leads,

[26:10] here is the next video for making you more dollars.

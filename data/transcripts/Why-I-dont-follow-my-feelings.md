[00:00] If you can expose someone to a stimuli and get a consistent outcome,

[00:05] a lot of marketers and salespeople like to talk about the internal thoughts of someone's

[00:08] has like, first they need awareness and then they need blah blah blah. And then they need, and so

[00:11] they're basically just make up the reverse engineer, fictitious steps of someone's

[00:15] mental thought process when they have no evidence to support what someone's thinking at all.

[00:21] And so I don't find it useful because it's not useful. Like what are the things that are useful

[00:27] are the things that are observable that we can drive action towards, that we create an outcome,

[00:31] and then we have a feedback loop. And so if we have those things, then we can move the variables

[00:37] and get closer to where we're trying to go. And the feelings, although I recognize that they exist,

[00:42] they're not helpful in trying to edit what our activities are. I would say there are days that I

[00:48] feel like less energized or things like that for sure, not about like the big picture of like,

[00:52] I don't believe that this cause is not worthy. But I do think a lot of people have that, too,

[00:56] where they're like, what I'm doing is meaningless, right? And then I get into, I think everything's

[01:00] meaningless, and then we can just create whatever meaning, you know, we choose to because if we don't

[01:05] believe in a capital M meaning, which a lot of people disagree with, then it's fine. But if you don't

[01:08] believe in a capital M meaning, I think that's very freeing because then you can create little

[01:11] M meaning for whatever you want. And so if you believe you can then choose to architect your own life

[01:16] in whatever ways that you're demeaning for and make the activities you do aligned with that meaning.

[01:22] The difference between capital M meaning and little M meaning, and this is kind of like the basis of

[01:26] nihilism, which people have like a very negative viewpoint around, which I'm not entirely sure about.

[01:30] Why? But like, capital M meaning means that like, this is the meaning of life period,

[01:34] like for everyone. This is the meaning of life. Whereas if we say that there is no single agreed upon

[01:41] meaning of life, and then people say, well, then that is your big meaning of life. And I'm like,

[01:44] yes, you're right. I believe that there is no meaning. That is the meaning that I, that I believe.

[01:47] And they're like, well, then that is the capital M. Then sure, that's my capital M meaning is that

[01:50] there is no meaning. What's the implication of that? It means now that we have meaning make machines in

[01:56] our brain. And so we get to create and destroy meaning as we see fit. And so if we choose an activity,

[02:02] and we deem that goal meaningful, because we think it's more interesting or it energizes us,

[02:06] then we can ascribe meaning to that and do more of it. And what's nice about not having capital M meaning is that

[02:10] that can shift, right? That might be good for a season, and then it can shift. I will say that the

[02:15] downside of not having capital M meaning, which I consider to be religion off the shelf,

[02:19] is that it's more difficult because you have no one who's saying, here's the big box of rules,

[02:22] you can read it, and then that way you'll have to make the decisions about it. But I think it's

[02:26] more difficult, but ultimately more rewarding if you have reasoning behind why you believe what you

[02:31] believe. Because then you have to independently come up with your own conclusions about those things.

[02:35] It also makes it malleable so that if you get new data or new evidence, then you can change your mind,

[02:40] which a lot of people again have difficulty with. But like if you change the information,

[02:44] then it would make sense that if a materialy changes the outcome, the way that you believe about

[02:49] something should change. And I think a lot of people identify with their beliefs as a part of

[02:55] themselves rather than as what I prefer to call them, which is assumptions. Because they work the

[03:00] same way, what's the difference in belief in assumption? Not a lot, right? The only difference is just

[03:03] what we call the word. And so assumptions are based on things that we've observed and then we assume

[03:08] something as a result. And so I would say the beliefs are just assumptions. But when you call them that,

[03:13] they become less tied to your identity. If you have an assumption, you don't say,

[03:17] you challenge my assumption. It's like, wait, I challenge my assumption. Oh, that's great. I was assuming this.

[03:21] It must be this. And then they become much more flexible. And then we don't tie our egos into them.

[03:26] And I think ultimately it serves more people better in the lower room. I feel passionately about my viewpoint

[03:31] in the world, mostly because I struggled and I was in so much pain for such a long period of time.

[03:35] I'm only sharing this despite the fact that I get attacked for sharing this,

[03:39] because there are people who this does rest in any way. But when there is no required meeting,

[03:45] then a lot of language changes, which is should must need have to, like all of these things,

[03:52] no longer exist because there is no capital in meaning. So I don't should have to must

[03:56] need to anything. And so a lot of the expectations that we bury ourselves into that way,

[04:02] as down, are just implied, should's have to's musts. And so if all of those disappeared,

[04:07] then in a lot of ways it's for liberating. And so for me, in business, it allows me to take actions

[04:13] even though I know that I shouldn't, or must not, or other people would judge me for not doing

[04:19] it the way that they thought I should do it, because there are no rules, which is why that was the

[04:23] preface to the book. It's like there are no rules. We can live our life, whatever way we want to live it.

[04:28] And that's okay. I read a YouTube come with the other day. It's like, hey, you know,

[04:32] you talk a lot about being sad and like how have you been able to X, Y, and Z, and I don't

[04:37] identify with being a sad person. I think I have been sad in the past, but I also don't think

[04:42] that there's a problem with being sad. And so I think that there's just so much power in acceptance.

[04:49] So like so many people will make themselves miserable because they think that they shouldn't be who they are

[04:53] and they shouldn't feel how they feel. And so much of the medication that gets prescribed right now is

[04:56] because someone's like, oh, I'm anxious. And why do we feel like someone shouldn't be anxious? They are

[05:00] human. Why do we feel like we shouldn't feel sad? We are human. Why do we feel like we shouldn't feel

[05:04] frustrated or angry? We are human. And so I think it's one of the most like interesting things are

[05:08] phenomena where if you have a line which is the normal human existence and you have points above

[05:13] the line and points below the line, you have the median, right? Or if the middle point. And

[05:16] people want to not feel the things below the line. And then we ascribe or label the things below the line

[05:22] is bad and things above line is good when all of it is. And so I think that if we just accept that

[05:27] and accept ourselves and accept the feelings that we experience as things that we experience like

[05:31] rain and weather and sunshine, it's not like rain is bad. Not like sunshine is good. And just as

[05:36] I like happiness is good or happiness is bad or sadness is bad or sadness is good. We just label it that way.

[05:42] And I think the labels create more suffering than anything that we ever actually experience.

[05:46] So when you're sad, do you try to not be sad? No, I actually don't think about it much.

[05:53] I think a lot of people spend a lot of time and effort trying to figure out how they feel

[05:56] because they want to then judge or label themselves as I'm doing well at not well.

[06:00] Like a lot of effort goes into showing like how do I feel about this? I mean my father

[06:03] pushing me like why do you care? Why does it matter? And that's why when you asked way long ago

[06:07] about like how do you how much do you think feelings matter? I don't think they matter at all.

[06:13] Like what would the case for feelings matter being?

[06:16] Why do you believe they exist? It's a good question. And it gets really interesting because it's like

[06:21] how I experience a feeling that I label in my head is sadness. Is it the same way you experience

[06:26] the thing that you let it's like seeing green and icy green and you see green what if all of our

[06:30] greens are different. I mean it gets very interesting like that. But I think that I experienced something

[06:34] and if we were to just measure it based on like brain activity and like heart rate, I would say that

[06:38] I'd become aroused in the literal sense from experiencing what I would deem as emotions and so

[06:43] if we were to describe it or define the term in that way I think I experienced emotions.

[06:47] And so I mean I barely confident I experienced emotions. If we were to try and measure it that way

[06:51] and that's how it's a yes I do experience them. But the question is just like how important are they?

[06:55] And then it would be like for what? If it's for accomplishment not very important. For fitness not very

[07:01] important, you know? If we're saying how important is emotion for love which is another emotion?

[07:07] Right? It becomes like a morphist trying to go to a morphist but then you say okay well for defining

[07:12] love by what I'm willing to endure to continue to keep something then how important is it? Well it

[07:18] depends on how much I've conditioned myself to accept this thing. So like if I want to stay married it's

[07:22] probably for more effective to condition someone to stay married because that is the external

[07:26] consequence of a good marriage as you stay together. Right? I'm just saying like we're just purely

[07:31] measuring from from external circumstances. And so I think trying to measure and define things is what I

[07:35] actually geek out on and I really enjoy. I think most people get bored of tears when I talk about this

[07:39] stuff so I don't talk about it much. But that's the stuff that like when we keep peeling back

[07:44] layers of like why do you think you're able to get out of you know a difficult place in your life or why do

[07:49] you think you're able to go through these things? A lot of it is because I believe that I will redefine

[07:55] terms and so we'll have some instance or something that I should do and I will redefine it or I'll say

[08:01] I don't should. I can just accept it. And that's why the biggest refrain that I have in my head for like my

[08:05] own mental wellness is just like and that's okay period. I don't want to go to that thing but that's okay.

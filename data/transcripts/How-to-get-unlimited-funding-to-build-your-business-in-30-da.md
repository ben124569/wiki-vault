[00:00] In this video, I'm going to explain the single equation that helped me turn $1,036 into over $120 million in sales.

[00:08] And right now, our portfolio company is about $85 million a year.

[00:12] So this concept has been the central concept to how we've grown each of our portfolio companies with 100% equity

[00:18] without taking on outside capital investors.

[00:21] And so the key here is if you don't have a lot of money, you have to think different and play the game differently.

[00:25] Most people, when they try and play the game, when they get the investors from outside,

[00:28] but they have some sort of seed capital of their own, they think I'm going to have to take two or three years before my business is break even or positive.

[00:36] And that is definitely a belief that you can have, but not necessarily one that you have to have.

[00:40] Right?

[00:40] And so I prefer to, you know, change the variables of the game that we're playing to try and figure out a way to make money all the time, right?

[00:47] Because it's like, well, if I could make money the whole time, then that would make this definitely more fun and a lot less stressful.

[00:51] And so the equation that I'm going to outline for you is what I call a client-finished acquisition.

[00:55] This is how we grew our first life, you know, shoot.

[00:58] I grew, I went from zero to six locations at my brick and mortar chain in three years, the 26 year old.

[01:05] And I was able to open up each of those locations at full capacity except for the first one obviously,

[01:09] but each of the ones after that, once I learned how to do this, on day one, so that's not normally common.

[01:14] So we're able to open up each facility at complete, completely full capacity.

[01:18] And then I did this at 33 other locations over the next few years.

[01:21] After that, we changed to just draw a license business and we used the exact same model that I'm about to show you.

[01:26] To go from zero to two and a half million dollars a month within, I think it was like 12 or 14 months.

[01:32] And then that's per month, not pre-year.

[01:34] So when from zero to 28 million top line, right?

[01:36] And then 12 months after that, we were at 4.4 million a month.

[01:40] The second business that added that up went from zero to 1.7 million a month and four months.

[01:45] All right, the third business we started, our software business went from zero to also 1.7 ironically.

[01:50] Within six months.

[01:51] And so this equation matters, profit matters.

[01:54] If you want to be in a capitalist society, because the only way that you're going to be able to weather the storms.

[01:58] All right, so this is the right or downer.

[02:00] This is an equation, but it's a process.

[02:02] All right, client-funnets acquisition.

[02:05] What this means in plain terms is get your customers to pay for all of your marketing and your acquisition costs.

[02:12] And so what that means is, if you can plug into the universe's money, not your own money,

[02:16] but you plug into the money of the universe, you can pretty much cash flow anything you need.

[02:20] Because you can make more money getting someone to enter your world than it cost you to get them there.

[02:25] And if that is your case, and you still have all the life to value that you're going to calculate if you can do that in the first 30 days.

[02:30] And you can pay the cost of fulfillment.

[02:32] And still have money left over, then you have what is called a negative acquisition cost.

[02:36] All right, it means that you make money getting customers.

[02:39] All right, so this is the actual equation.

[02:41] You know the number two, but then there's three things in here that you may or may not understand.

[02:45] And so I'm going to break down each of them.

[02:46] Let's call this number one.

[02:48] Let's call this number two.

[02:49] Let's call this number three.

[02:50] So if I want to read this in plain language, you would say 30 day cash, oopsies.

[02:54] I usually write this the other way.

[02:57] 30 day cash must be greater than 2 times the cost of acquiring customer and the cost of fulfilling that customer.

[03:04] Okay, so what this means is cost of acquisition.

[03:08] All right, so let's say cost me 100 bucks to a car customer.

[03:11] And that includes my marketing team, that includes my sales guys and their commissions.

[03:16] That includes the advertising or whatever method I did to car the lead.

[03:20] Okay, so let's say all of it cost me 100 bucks.

[03:23] I'm just using simple math here.

[03:24] Let's say that for me to fulfill this thing, whatever the thing is, let's say it cost me another hundred bucks.

[03:31] All right, so that's $200 that's going to cost me to fulfill and sell this thing.

[03:37] These are my costs, right?

[03:40] And so the idea is I have to have two times the sum of this.

[03:43] All right, remember this is in our little parentheses, which means this is $400.

[03:47] That is what I must make.

[03:49] Right, that has to be less than what I make in 30 day cash, which is a term that I use that I've never really heard anywhere else.

[03:55] I'm sure there's a fancier word for it, but I call it 30 day cash, which is the amount of money that I can collect in net free cash flow to my business within the first 30 days of a customer entering our world.

[04:08] Now, we may have upsels and downsels and continuity and future things that we're going to sell.

[04:12] But none of that matters to the small business owner who doesn't have cash.

[04:16] And so the reason it's 30 days is because that's the amount of time that you can get interest refinancing.

[04:21] All right, so if you have a credit card, people will extend your money for 30 days interest free.

[04:26] I mean, if you paid off in the first 30 days, you can pretty much take unlimited money.

[04:30] All right, for the most part, now you pay your stuff off, you get bigger limits, whatever.

[04:33] But the point is, and this is literally how I started my second business,

[04:36] is that I would use my cards, I'd put the money on the card to acquire the customer.

[04:41] So on my card, there'd be $200 because that's what's going to cost me to fulfill and acquire,

[04:47] but I would have made $400 on that.

[04:51] And the reason it has to be greater than this is because I have net, right, because we have to take out the 200 that we lost here.

[04:58] Do Do, right, minus 200. So I have 200 leftover.

[05:03] What a coincidence, that's the exact amount that's going to cost me to get another customer and fulfill that customer,

[05:09] which means that I'm going to get, you guessed it, another $400 from this customer.

[05:15] And we play the game again, which means that you have unlimited power to acquire new customers,

[05:21] which means you get unlimited money, which is why if you play the game this way,

[05:27] and you choose to think about acquisition in this manner, you can grow your companies without capital constraint.

[05:32] Now, it doesn't mean that there won't be constraints, there will be you have operational constraints,

[05:36] without hiring constraints, or other things, but if you play the game this way, getting new customers,

[05:40] and making sales will never be the thing that is limiting your company, it will be only you.

[05:45] And this is what we've done over and over and over again, is design a process in every business

[05:50] that we can figure out where the amount of dollars that we make in the first 30 days is greater than,

[05:55] two times the cost to acquire plus the cost of the fill, and that works in any business in the world.

[06:02] And now ideally, I don't want to be just twice, it just has to be more than that.

[06:06] If I can make this 10 times, then it's even better.

[06:10] All of those make it just even easier, because then I'm getting multiple customers,

[06:14] and I still have cash for to go invest in other things.

[06:17] But this is the minimum requirement for CFA, where what we call client-fund-answer,

[06:24] finance, acquisition. And so right now, if you don't have money, or you don't have capital, and you think it takes money to make money,

[06:32] you just keep believing that beautiful lie, and let everyone else go away at a while, you keep complaining.

[06:37] All right, so keeping awesome, low-z-nation, I know you're not that type of person,

[06:41] and so we can beat all those people who have those limited beliefs, but I had a thousand 36 dollars in my bank account five years ago.

[06:49] All right, and right now, the portfolio we do does 85 million dollars a year.

[06:53] I took no outside money to do that, which means if you can learn how to play and multiply and multiply and multiply and not use your own money,

[07:00] because I'm using my customers' money to finance all of the growth in this business.

[07:07] I know this is a little bit more tactical, I'll talk about more managing to be blunt and scaling the company side,

[07:12] but this is the stuff, right? This is the, this is the, these are the things that actually grow the business, all right?

[07:18] So anyways, love you all, keep being awesome, OZ-nation, I'll see you guys next week. Bye.

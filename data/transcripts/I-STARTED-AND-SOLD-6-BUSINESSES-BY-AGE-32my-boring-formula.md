[00:00] 99% of businesses end up closing down over a long enough time horizon.

[00:04] Only 1% of businesses ever get sold or train chance.

[00:07] And the reason for that is not because you might think, right?

[00:12] You might think that it's because business owners don't know how to sell their business

[00:15] or don't know how to market the business to get sold.

[00:16] But that's actually not the real reason.

[00:18] The real reason is because most businesses are worthless.

[00:22] And so what I want to talk about today is how to go from a worthless business

[00:26] to a business that has actual value.

[00:29] Hi, my name is Dr. Moses.

[00:30] I'm an acquisition.com.

[00:31] We're going to perform their companies at the $85 million year.

[00:33] And so my goal here, this channel is that there's a lot of people who are broken.

[00:35] I don't want you to be one of them.

[00:37] Right now, if you're a small business owner, which there's $30 million

[00:41] small businesses or whatever it is, a lot, most of these businesses don't actually

[00:44] have value.

[00:45] And the reason for that is because they are not businesses, they are jobs.

[00:50] And so if you remember Robert Kiesaki's wealth quadrant, I think it goes,

[00:56] employee, self-employed owner, and then investor, I believe that's the quadrant.

[01:01] I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that's what it is.

[01:03] At least that's how I would draw to my head in terms of some progression.

[01:05] So most of us have, most people have jobs first, right?

[01:07] And then they make a certain amount of money.

[01:09] They're relatively skilled and they think, you know, I could do something like this

[01:11] on my own, right?

[01:12] Or I could do something else on my own.

[01:13] And so then they switch to self-employed.

[01:15] And what they don't know is that switch from box one to box two is that you actually

[01:18] take a decrease in pay.

[01:19] And the reason for that is because you actually aren't that good yet.

[01:23] You know how to do one thing well here.

[01:24] And because of that, because you've fit into a larger machine, you're able to earn

[01:27] higher pay because as a sum of parts, you can actually provide more value, right?

[01:33] But when you actually have to be each of the parts, you're not that good at it yet.

[01:36] And so you become self-employed and you actually make significantly less for a long

[01:39] period of time.

[01:40] The thing is is that most people who are self-employed have an LLC, right?

[01:44] And so they consider themselves to be business owners, but the reality is that they are

[01:46] not business owners, they are self-employed.

[01:48] And even if you have other employees that work for you, you are still self-employed.

[01:53] And here's the litmus test for this, right?

[01:55] What happens is, and I have these conversations all the time because there's companies that

[01:58] apply to become portfolio companies with us, so we can invest in the companies and help them

[02:03] help them grow.

[02:04] And that's just for her FYI, it's when you're over 5 million bucks a year.

[02:07] So if you're not there, then don't worry about it and all the stuff is free, so just

[02:09] consume it.

[02:10] The thing that happens though is that they stop doing the actual fulfillment of the thing,

[02:14] whatever the widget is, whatever they're selling, whatever the service is, they're not

[02:17] actually doing the fulfillment.

[02:19] And so in that moment, they're like, I now own a business and I'm a business owner.

[02:23] And now I can sell this business.

[02:24] And that's so far from the truth because there are so many other things that must happen, right?

[02:29] In order for a business to be sellable, because for a business to be sellable, it must

[02:32] be an asset that can run without you.

[02:34] Now you might think, again, here's the fallacy, that your business can run without you.

[02:38] And that's because maybe you don't do the actual thing, but you are still involved in maybe

[02:42] the marketing and the sales, right?

[02:44] If you can't get someone to replace you in that, then you can't sell it.

[02:49] Now you might think, oh, I'll just sell them and somebody else will do that.

[02:52] This is not going to be a sellable thing.

[02:53] No one's going to do that because they're like, well, you haven't done it.

[02:55] Well, why would I believe that someone can do it besides you because you haven't proved it?

[02:59] And so what you have to do is prove to what a future buyer would be that this business

[03:03] can operate on its end without you, right?

[03:05] And so the next step, right, is that you replace the acquisition.

[03:08] So first, you have the services that you're not doing, then you replace the acquisition process

[03:12] to be something that is reliable.

[03:14] Pick one of the channels you want, you can pick referrals, you can pick affiliates, you

[03:17] can pick manual app owners, just code calls, code emails, whatever, you can pick owned

[03:21] media, which is like all the people that already have contact with it, you can message,

[03:24] you could have earned media, which is that you start creating a channel of your own that

[03:29] apply from a distribute your content and that's how you generate a business or you can

[03:32] do pay traffic, right?

[03:33] You could you pay media and start running ads on a consistent way to generate sales, right?

[03:37] No matter what it is, you have to have a consistent process where you know if you put

[03:40] X effort or X dollars in this side that you will get Y outcome on the other side, right?

[03:45] And if you don't have that, then you don't have a sellable business.

[03:47] Now here's what happens next.

[03:49] So first you, you productize your service, so it's a consistent thing that you deliver

[03:53] over and over again.

[03:54] You're not custom, if it's custom, it's going to be terrible and it's going to be, it's

[03:57] going to be valid as a service based business, which is going to suck and you're not

[03:59] going to be able to sell it.

[04:00] You're going to have a massive earnout, which basically means you're going to work for

[04:02] the next five years to earn the exact same pegs, if you no longer own the business and

[04:06] the person who gives you the earnout has all the upside and you take all the risk and they

[04:10] get all the upside.

[04:11] So no one are there.

[04:12] And so you've productized the service, you have a projective block to position process, right?

[04:17] And you're like, now I can sell the business.

[04:19] Ah, wait, there's more.

[04:21] Because the thing is is that you still own all the hats.

[04:24] You still might be managing the sales team, you might still be managing the marketing,

[04:27] you still might be innovating the product, you still might be making all the chief decisions,

[04:32] right?

[04:33] You still might even be operating the business, just not actually doing any of those things.

[04:36] And so to say that like, I'm not a business owner in this, this works without me, is

[04:40] not true.

[04:41] You were just, you were doing higher level skills, which believe it or not, are more expensive

[04:44] to replace, believe it.

[04:46] And so now you have to go find someone who's going to become your VP of sales so you can

[04:50] take that head off.

[04:51] And who's going to become your director of marketing so you can take that head off.

[04:54] And then who's going to become the chief product guy who's going to be consistently innovating

[04:58] the product and improving it so that it delivers excess value to your customers.

[05:02] Right?

[05:03] So you have all these hats on.

[05:04] And so the process of entrepreneurship of transitioning from self-employed where you literally

[05:07] have a hundred hats, right?

[05:09] Two transition to business owner where you take all the hats off your head and you were just

[05:12] a shareholder, which I prefer to see it, is like you have to think yourself not as the

[05:15] owner, but as the director of the board, as the chief shareholder in the company, rather

[05:22] than the owner.

[05:23] Okay, even that change in language, I think it's helpful and it was for me.

[05:26] What we have to do here, and if you're like, man, that's going to take a long time for

[05:29] you to do it.

[05:30] Duh, that's why most businesses don't get sold.

[05:32] And that's why it's sometimes it takes years to build something that's great, right?

[05:35] It might take you three years, it might take you five years, it might take you ten years,

[05:39] right, to get the business to that point.

[05:40] And if you're like, man, if I only just had XYZ in certain person, I could do this.

[05:44] Welcome to entrepreneurship.

[05:46] The game is about people.

[05:47] Once you have the model and you have some of the tactics in the beginnings, you can get

[05:51] some initial traction, the rest of it is people.

[05:54] People are the thing that are going to run this machine for you.

[05:56] That means you have to learn how to recruit, how to hire, how to manage, and how to lead.

[06:00] Those are the soft skills that are harder to, they're less tangible, but they're just

[06:05] as important and you're not more so.

[06:07] When you look at the biggest billionaires and multimilionaires out there, they keep

[06:11] their space around them very clean.

[06:14] They know what they stand for, they know, and people are attracted to them because they

[06:17] have admirable qualities and traits.

[06:19] And that is how you get the higher level people.

[06:22] So think about this.

[06:23] So let's say that you've got somebody who's a brilliant marketer who can generate demand

[06:28] like crazy for you, right?

[06:30] Well, that person isn't going to work for someone who's lower skilled than they are,

[06:34] right?

[06:35] You have to have more skills to attract the type of people that you want who are going

[06:39] to help you run this business and grow it because they have to believe in the vision.

[06:41] They want to do something that's meaningful.

[06:43] And so the journey here is understanding, and this is the piece that a thing most people

[06:48] miss is that they don't even know the hats that they are wearing.

[06:52] You make decisions is a hat.

[06:54] It's an important hat, right?

[06:56] And so selling it without the person who can make decisions is in a business, right?

[06:59] If you're selling it and you're still the chief marketing officer, you're the one who's

[07:02] controlling the messaging and the branding and all of those things, it's still like that,

[07:08] that role still exists.

[07:10] And so there's typically far more leadership that has to occur in order for the business

[07:15] to be sellable.

[07:16] And here's the thing.

[07:17] Now all of a sudden, all of these roles that you've been doing up to this point, you've

[07:21] been taking profit, profit, sell discussion errands, SDE, right?

[07:25] From the business, when in reality, a lot of that profit must be allocated back to the

[07:29] roles that you're doing, but you're not choosing to pay yourself for it, right?

[07:32] What happens is, a business will become more sellable as you replace all of the pieces

[07:36] that you're doing and oftentimes the marginal drop.

[07:39] But that is okay because now you have 100% of your time back and then you are truly a shareholder

[07:43] in the company and this takes years, not months, not weeks.

[07:46] And the thing is, is you're going to hire somebody who you think is going to get a marketing

[07:49] and they're not going to be, and then you have to hire another person.

[07:51] And then you think they're going to be good at marketing and they're not.

[07:53] And then you got to hire another person, right?

[07:55] And if you're like, man, that sounds tiring.

[07:56] That's the reason most people who own big companies are like, it is hard to do this.

[08:00] This is not easy.

[08:01] This is not for the faint of heart.

[08:02] You must have a long-term vision that you are committed to because you will burn out if you're

[08:07] only doing it for the money.

[08:08] You will.

[08:09] Because once you've satisfied your personal needs, you'll just stop being inspired by the

[08:12] reason that you're doing this, right?

[08:14] And the thing is, is your employees will be even less inspired because all of it starts

[08:17] with you and then gets diluted down.

[08:19] And so if you are not extremely potent, right, you are not extremely distilled down in terms

[08:23] of your vision of where you want to go and why you're doing this, why the business even

[08:27] exists, then other people will be even less so and less committed to that vision.

[08:30] And you will track lower quality people and they will turn out and they will not be skilled,

[08:34] etc.

[08:35] And the thing is, the small businesses become big businesses because you need to slowly

[08:39] grow them so that you can accommodate more people, right, who can actually do all of the

[08:44] things that you do.

[08:45] And the reality is that you're not going to find, because right now you're like, well,

[08:47] there's one of me, so I need to hire one more person.

[08:49] But that's not reality, right?

[08:51] You might be doing six things and you might have to hire six people to do what you were

[08:55] doing.

[08:56] And of course you do, and that sounds unreasonable, but welcome to business.

[08:58] And so for businesses to be scalable, oftentimes they have to have significant enough

[09:02] gross margins and volume to be able to pay for high quality talents to be able to actually

[09:08] do these things and take decisions off your plate.

[09:10] And where you get into the point of kind of like hypergrowth and hyper scale where you

[09:13] starting to talk 10 million, 20 million, 30 million plus per year, right, is when you have

[09:18] people who come with solutions preloaded, they come with experience of having done the thing

[09:23] that you need to solve already.

[09:25] So this, like, you'll notice the transition to the business owner, and I'll tell you

[09:28] this right now, is that once you start crossing multiple figures, the people that you

[09:31] are hiring are better than you are at everything.

[09:35] And that's one of the, that's one of the weird things that happens because in the beginning,

[09:38] most people don't have the skills that you do, right?

[09:41] And so you have to hire people who are not as good as you are and then you have to train them,

[09:45] right?

[09:46] And then later on you start hiring people who are okay at some things, you still have to train

[09:50] them on how you want it done.

[09:52] So they have, they've done the type of role in the business in the past, but they don't

[09:55] know how you want it done here.

[09:57] So you have some training, but there's less than there's some experience, right?

[10:00] The level above that is when people come in, they know what to do, and they know how to do

[10:04] it better, better than you for your specific business.

[10:07] And when then that happens, then you realize how literally utility you actually have in the

[10:12] business, and how you're really only role is to just recruit people, right?

[10:16] Recruit people and cast the vision of where you are want to make the bet for the company

[10:21] of where you want it to go.

[10:23] And so anyways, the reason that most businesses are worthless is because they sell entirely

[10:27] customized things, they sell it to everyone, which makes it completely unscalable.

[10:31] They're the ones who are still heavily involved in the acquisition and the rainmaking.

[10:34] And so because of that, and then even then, even after they've graduated from getting

[10:38] out of the selling and getting out of the filament, the business still doesn't have value,

[10:42] because they might still be the talking face.

[10:43] They still may be the spokesperson, which means that the business has no value outside of

[10:47] themselves because no one else could take it over, right?

[10:50] Unless the person agreed to a three or five year earnout, which then means that you transfer

[10:54] to the ownership to someone else, they get all of the upside, and if you don't hit

[10:57] the milestones, they get your business anyways, and you get none of the money, right?

[11:01] And so it may sound arduous to do this, and it is.

[11:04] But I can tell you that having now gone through this process, it is one of the most worthwhile

[11:08] things that you can do is look at the business as a true-soluble asset, because I heard this

[11:12] from, heard this quote from MIT, due to spoke from John Warlowe's book.

[11:17] But anyways, he said, all of you guys are busy selling your services.

[11:21] You should be doing a selling your business, right?

[11:24] You as the CEO or the owner, your job is to sell the business, the job of the salespeople

[11:30] is to sell the products, right?

[11:31] Once you can make the transition from your businesses or your products, rather than your

[11:35] services of the business or the products, you move up in a level of an order of magnitude,

[11:42] right?

[11:43] And so I'm not saying that you should immediately be selling your business, right?

[11:46] But you should be making your business sell a bull.

[11:49] And the beauty of this is that when you go through this process, you end up having phenomenal

[11:53] leverage in any kind of negotiation that you want to have in the future, and this is

[11:56] a key hack for negotiating FYI, is that don't need the deal.

[12:01] The guy who needs the deal, the less is the way that you negotiate.

[12:03] Like everyone wants all these tricks and tactics and things for negotiating, the way to have

[12:08] the best negotiation is to have the most leverage, the way to have the most leverage, the

[12:11] not need the deal.

[12:13] Simple, right?

[12:14] Simple, not easy.

[12:15] How about that?

[12:17] If you want to sell your business someday for a lot of money, then the business must be

[12:19] sellable.

[12:21] And in order for you to do that, you must get to the business to the point where you don't

[12:24] even mind keeping it because it's still cash flow so much money to you and you don't do

[12:27] anything.

[12:28] That is the position of FU.

[12:30] That is the position where you'll get the most money because now you have something

[12:33] that people want.

[12:34] No one wants a business where the owners, you know, no one wants to buy themselves a job,

[12:38] right?

[12:39] And they don't want to buy themselves your job.

[12:41] And so you have to think, and this is the critical self awareness of thinking, like, what

[12:44] are the actual things that I do?

[12:45] Everyone wants to think, oh no, I don't do anything.

[12:46] That's the thing that runs itself.

[12:47] Except if you step away and didn't answer calls for two months with the business

[12:50] to run itself, probably not.

[12:52] So then we have to look at what are we actually doing?

[12:55] And it might be little fractional things that we're doing all over the place, but we

[12:58] still have to quantify those things and we still have to put processes around them.

[13:01] And then hand them to people and see how they do and then continue to improve them until

[13:04] eventually you get to that promise land where you don't actually have to do anything.

[13:08] And you can still own the business.

[13:10] And I mean to prove this, like you can probably own shares of companies on the public traded

[13:14] market, they have figured this out.

[13:16] And you can own a piece and participate in the upside without ever looking at what Apple

[13:20] is doing for their roadmap.

[13:23] And so we have to get to that point as business owners in order to make the asset that

[13:26] we own, the most viable thing that we have, probably the biggest thing on our net worth

[13:29] balance sheet is all the equity that we have on our businesses.

[13:32] And to increase the value of that equity, we have to make it so that it actually a business

[13:36] and we transition from employee to self-employed to owner.

[13:40] And then the transition there goes from owner to investor.

[13:42] Because when you make that transition, that is when you start seeing your business for

[13:46] what it is, which is a sensible asset that sits on your net worth balance sheet.

[13:49] And so this is one of the hardest lessons that took me to longest amount of time to learn.

[13:53] And hopefully just translating this to you because I see so many people who are like,

[13:56] I want to sell my business, but the business is not sellable.

[13:59] And it is worthless without them.

[14:00] And so we can't just say, oh, the next person's going to figure it out because they're

[14:03] not going to.

[14:04] I'll tell you right now they're not going to.

[14:05] You have to figure it out.

[14:06] And what most people do instead is they just start another business because they don't

[14:09] know how to solve the problem.

[14:10] And so we must confront the problems that we have, which is you have to articulate the thing

[14:14] that you don't know how to do as a problem that you can solve, which is I don't know

[14:17] how to insert, find, hire, direct, a marketing director.

[14:20] I do not know how to find a VP of sales and train them and manage them and grow them.

[14:25] I do not know how to find a chief product officer who's going to innovate the products

[14:30] on my behalf and make it better than I ever could.

[14:32] And make it better product and make it better client experience around it and

[14:34] insistently improve it based on these metrics.

[14:37] Until we can articulate what the problems are, we cannot solve them.

[14:41] And if we consistently live in this world of, like, I just want to solve my business

[14:44] someday, you're not going to be able to until you put these pieces in place so that the

[14:48] business is sell-in, actually has value in and of itself, separate from you.

[14:51] And then when that happens, your network will skyrocket because now you have something

[14:55] that everyone wants, which is an asset that produces cash while you sleep.

[14:58] So anyways, my name is Dr. Mosie.

[00:00] Entrepreneurs and business owners, my name is Alex Ramozi, and in the last four years we've done

[00:04] 120 million in sales across my four company. I just want to share some of the lessons that

[00:08] have worked well for us in this time period. So one of the questions we get is like how do I make

[00:13] more money? And a lot of times people think about acquisition stuff and sometimes it is acquisition

[00:17] based. But the other half of the equation is making the customers more valuable. All right,

[00:20] one of the key ways of doing that is delivering more valuable services. And so services in general,

[00:27] right, you can think about this from consulting basis, you can think about this from a service

[00:30] whatever. So this is not for physical product basis, this is for service type businesses. All right,

[00:35] and so what I want to walk you through is what I call the service delivery cube, it's cube because

[00:39] there's six sides. You're going to see the chart that I'm showing you right here is six. And I'll walk

[00:43] three each one of them. This is a creative process that I use and I'm thinking about how can I

[00:48] explain product lines, what thing can I do with the existing resources that I have that can provide

[00:52] more value to my customers. And you'd be amazed that if you walk through this cube so many

[00:57] opportunities will jump out of you using what you know, access capacity or sawdust, right? So if you

[01:03] if you were, if you had a lumber mill and all you do is you sell lumber, there's all this sawdust

[01:07] that comes up on the ground and it's like how can we monetize the sawdust, right? We could

[01:10] we can make sandpaper out of it, we can put it in the pellets so that they can make pellets

[01:13] doves, right? So how can we, how can we use what we already have without incurring more cost and

[01:18] drive more value to our clients by repackaging the same thing? And so this is called a service delivery

[01:24] so there's six components of this. One is the ratio, all right? Which is what's my client ratio

[01:32] for a service? What if I wanted to do something one on one, what if I wanted to do small group,

[01:37] what if I wanted to do one to many, all right? One to unlimited amount. So whatever I'm doing now,

[01:42] I like to think about is there a way that I could do this one on one? Is there a way that I could do this

[01:46] just a small group? Is this way, is there a way I could do this one to many? Right? So this is the

[01:49] first kind of filter that I'll look any service or potential other offering through. The next is

[01:56] what extent is my client going to be involved? Is it going to be, do it yourself? Is it going to be

[02:00] done with you? Right? We're going to help them implement a change of some kind or is it going to be

[02:07] done for you? It's hands off, they just pay us money and they get this result. All right? And so these

[02:11] are varying levels of value and service. All right? What's interesting about this one is that

[02:16] I like there's another video I'll make another example of sales to fulfillment continuum.

[02:20] But basically the harder the easier it is for you to fulfill, the harder it tends to be to sell.

[02:27] And so do it yourself is one of the hardest things to sell to someone because it's such low value

[02:31] because all of the efforts on that. Done with you is a little bit easier to sell because you have a

[02:36] little bit of an educational component so they feel like they're learning the skill, right? And it's a

[02:40] little easier for you to fulfill on. And then finally the easiest thing to sell is done for you because

[02:45] someone just gives you money and they get the result and it's the shortcut, right? But this tends to be the

[02:48] most operationally complex. There are, you know, billion dollar companies in each of these, in each of

[02:53] these spaces, they're just very on, you know, the more do it yourself, it is, the more of a marketing

[02:57] and equity company it is, the more done for you to as many times these types of companies can provide

[03:02] such such value that people just come to them, right? And so that's the second of the service

[03:08] delivery queue but things that I'm looking at. So I might already have one of these, is there a way

[03:12] to go up or down on this scale, right? The third is what I would consider support level, all right?

[03:18] And where they're going to get support, all right? So are they going to be supported in this process via

[03:24] text? I think it can be supported in this process via chat? They can be a process via email via, you know,

[03:30] expert representative via phone via zoom, what's the channel or channels that they're going to have

[03:36] access to me and my team, all right? Excuse me. The fourth is going to be, how do I want them to consume

[03:46] the information? All right? So if I'm going to have some sort of service delivery, there's going to be

[03:51] some sort of onboarding process, right? Do I want this to be live, right? Do I want this to be recorded?

[03:57] Do I want this to be written, right? Do I want this to be, do I want this to be audio, right? Like

[04:04] if you're listening to the podcast, I want to have like audio book versions of this to want this to be video,

[04:08] right? And all of these things can be live or recorded. So those are kind of the variations in terms of how

[04:13] I want them to consume, right? This is the consumption piece, consumption, consume the information, right? And so

[04:19] we're going through the service delivery cube. So I'm clicking it, what's the ratio? And the thing is is all of

[04:24] these are a lot of variables. And that's okay. The point is that if you already have something, you can look at

[04:29] where it fits on all six of these things and say, can I move it one to the left or one to the right?

[04:33] Right? And if you think about that way, you'll be able to, excuse me, little tickle there.

[04:41] Be able to come up with a new product that might be more valuable and maybe even less cost to you,

[04:45] right? And that's what we're trying to find is I want to unearth where there's hidden value

[04:50] within my company using the existing resources I have that can drive more revenue and profit

[04:54] to the business, all right? The next is speeding convenience, all right? So one of my favorite

[04:58] things is that fast beats free. And so if you look at, you look at Uber. People could walk,

[05:05] they take Uber. You look at FedEx. They could use the US Postal Service, but instead they pay

[05:08] more to get it overnight. Spotify, there's free free music on the internet, but it was a pain in

[05:13] the asking, a download, all that stuff. Instead, Spotify came in and it was, you could pay to not have

[05:18] the inconvenience, right? So speed in and of itself is something that people will pay for. All right?

[05:22] So is there a way that I can, that I can cut the results in half the time? Is there a way that I can

[05:26] speed up my support? So maybe I have normal support, which is, you know, you get a reply,

[05:31] 24 hours, but then I have VIP support, which is you get a response in 60 minutes or less, right?

[05:37] So it's all my existing resources, but just put in repackaged in a different way the different

[05:42] expectation for the client, right? And a lot of people will pay for that. So that's an easy one that

[05:46] we can deliver value for. All right? So it's the fifth one. And then the last one, excuse me,

[05:51] is more of a mental exercise, which I call the one 10x to one 10th. All right? And this is a creative

[05:57] process that I like to think of, which is, if I were to 10x my price of this thing, what else would

[06:03] I include, right? What else would I be willing to do, right? And on the flip side, if the price of what I

[06:08] if I did was one 10th, if I, if I had defeated into one 10th the price and I had to deliver more

[06:15] value than I am right now, how would I do it? And so there are two, there's are two creative

[06:19] questions from different ends of the scale. So if I had a thousand dollar product for example,

[06:23] if my thing was 10,000 dollars, what would I be able to do that I'm not doing now? Right? And a lot

[06:28] of times, some of the creative ideas you have, you could actually still do right now at these price

[06:31] points and figure out how to jam pack more value into your offering. And on the flip side, if I

[06:37] offered my product for a hundred dollars and I said I had to make it more valuable than it currently

[06:42] is, what else would I include, what else would I build into this thing? Right? And so by thinking

[06:47] through both of those processes, I can usually come up with new ways to repackage products and

[06:52] offerings and services to become more valuable. All right? So the service delivery cube, the reason

[06:58] that I go through this is because I want to see how I can find access capacity in my business

[07:02] to jam and more revenue and profit without taking more expenses or liability. And I look at where

[07:07] my current products exist on this cube and think, could I go one of the left or one of the

[07:12] right, any of these six? I'll say I'm going to get from the top. We've got the ratio of,

[07:16] is it going to be one of one? It's going to be smaller, it's going to be one of many. I've got

[07:19] what level of effort are they going to be putting in? Is it do it yourself done with you or

[07:22] done for you? Right? Can I move either way down on this? The third is going to be what level of support

[07:27] or what channels of support excuse me? Are the clients in the get? Are they going to get only

[07:31] taxed? Are they going to get only phone calls? Are they going to get phone and call? Or can I have

[07:35] different levels based on these channels? Like we have our lower level, which is just email and we've

[07:40] got a higher level, which is phone and zoom, right? The fourth is going to be how I want them to

[07:45] consume this. Do I want this to be a live experience with this recorded experience? Do I want

[07:48] this to be written, audio or video? How do I want them to consume information for me as a business?

[07:54] Fifth is how can I make this more convenient or less convenient? How can I make this faster?

[07:57] For them? How can I increase the speed of communication with them? Right? How can I deliver that

[08:02] in a way that's going to be in a very, very, very way more valuable? People pay for speed.

[08:06] All right? One of the easiest things the entire world is look at any service category that exists

[08:10] and see if you can deliver the result in half the time. Just focus on that. Right? I mean,

[08:14] Amazon Prime, think about it. They created it in its own movement. They changed the trust

[08:20] from the entire e-commerce space simply by saying we're going to get stuff to everyone's

[08:23] in two days. Right? Now one day, now hours. Right? And then finally, the creative process of 10

[08:29] extra one-tenth. If I had, if I were selling this for 10 times more than I am right now,

[08:33] what would I include that I'm not? And then can I include those in my current offering? Because I just

[08:37] didn't think about it. And then if I had to deliver more value that I currently am, and I was

[08:42] excuse me, do this for one-tenth price. What would I get back into that thing? And so,

[08:49] this is the service delivery cube. Hopefully you found this valuable so I don't choke on myself

[08:52] from the stick on that I'm trying to keep down. Use this, think through it, and if you're,

[08:57] if you're meeting with your team and thinking how could we provide more value,

[09:00] this is one of the easiest cubes I'll like to walk through. So lots of love keeping awesome

[09:03] kitchen, the flip side like subscribe. Comment, tell me some questions and I will post some answers

[09:08] to them. So keep it going, so catch you soon. Bye!

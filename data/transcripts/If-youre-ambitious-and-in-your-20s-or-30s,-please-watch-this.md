[00:00] I've been a business for 13 years, and since 2023 the company's I started have reached $100,000

[00:04] plus valuation. Here's no-beous advice to help you crush 2025. My first piece of advice is

[00:10] set fewer goals and do less long-term planning. Hear me out. And to this may sound contradictory,

[00:17] does some of my content about being patient. And I think long-term goals are very important,

[00:21] but the obsession over the minutia of how you're going to get there is I believe in

[00:26] act of mental masturbation. You try and create these massive projections that are based on

[00:31] hundreds of variables that in reality you just don't know what's going to happen. And so over time

[00:37] I've consistently trimmed and trimmed and trimmed our planning processes such that at this point

[00:42] I pretty much only care what we're going to do in the next 12 weeks. And beyond that we might

[00:47] have one target or two targets by the end of the year, but we're not going to dedicate a lot of

[00:51] resources to this. And this is somebody who's coming through who's a big fan of preparation.

[00:55] But I've just found that it ended up being a huge waste of time, mostly because whenever I looked

[00:59] at the plans that I made the year before, one year later I was like, man half this stuff isn't

[01:04] even relevant anymore because of new changes and conditions. And so I will probably continue to

[01:10] lean more in this direction. And I think this has become a little bit more popularized by some

[01:13] of the CEOs like Jensen Hoeing who despite having the video over 30 plus years has recently talked

[01:18] about how you basically doesn't do a lot of long-term planning because fundamentally you have

[01:23] things that you can do today and those are the things that you can allocate. Now sometimes what you need

[01:28] to do today is work for something that's going to happen in the future but you can only control what

[01:32] you do today. And so I have shifted more and more in terms of what will this change about our behavior

[01:37] and the rest of it I'm more or less tossed out. So let me give you a couple of visuals to make this

[01:42] real. And so the first thing is that we think that you're going to have this really neat line

[01:48] of how the growth is going to happen, right? But reality is very messy. And so what's likely going

[01:54] to happen is that you will flatline and then figure something out and then you will flatline and

[01:58] then figure something out and then flatline and then figure something out. This is what it looks like

[02:02] if you were to zoom in on this little area here, right? If you were to zoom in here it actually

[02:07] looks closer to what this is which is you have this stagnation and then you have these improvements

[02:11] that occur and then increase revenue. Now one of the things that's also shifted my perspective on how

[02:17] to plan is let's say that we've got thing A, thing B, things C, things D, things E that we need to do.

[02:25] Well before this I would try and you know delegate each of these things to person one,

[02:32] person two, person three, person four, person five and so on. But I would say that that appears to me

[02:39] like I have not done my job because I need to do a better job prioritizing. One of these things

[02:45] is the most important and if you can't decide what that is then you are not doing your job

[02:50] and you certainly can't expect your team to make that decision for you. And so I've had to look at

[02:54] this and say if I could only pick one of these things and we only accomplish that thing which of these

[03:00] we get as closer to our vision for what the company should be which one would move us the

[03:05] furthest forward which of these is the biggest dominole and so what I've redone is I say okay

[03:12] A is actually the priority. I don't need to order B through C here. I don't need to worry about

[03:18] what order these are in and then I will take one plus two plus three plus four plus five and get

[03:25] all of these resources concentrated on solving A. And then what I found is that once you solve A with

[03:32] all those resources because everyone's aligned then all of a sudden B happens faster C happens faster

[03:37] G happens faster then trying to do them all at once. So let's say that you ran an agency.

[03:43] So you do meta ads for small businesses like a very typical business. So if that was your business

[03:50] you might say okay we need to you know get more leads so that means we're going to increase ads.

[03:56] Okay that's one of the things we're going to increase shop rate because our shop rate sucks so

[04:01] we're going to we're going to try and fix that. We've got a higher sales manager and whatever else

[04:07] right like you've got you've got your tasks I'll just put dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot. Now if this was your

[04:12] objective a good strategy says given the resources I currently have what one thing could I do that

[04:19] would make all of these problems disappear the good strategy would then say well if I had a brand

[04:26] and I invested in my brand well with that without accomplish my leads thing yeah now I wouldn't have

[04:32] ads but it would accomplish my problem of getting leads now would show rates be higher if I have a

[04:36] warm audience yes would my clothes rate be okay because everyone is being warmer probably now you

[04:42] might have to still hire the sales manager but you can see how the entire dynamic would change if only

[04:48] this were true and so then it follows okay what what are the resources required to make this happen

[04:55] and if I know what those resources are and I have those resources available then it would follow

[05:00] that I should do this one thing and then in so doing accomplish all of these other things

[05:06] as a consequence and this is why to be clear if you're like wait well they're just going to say

[05:11] build a better product because if you have a good product you're not going to lose people you're

[05:15] going to get word of mouth you're going to have higher LTV or they're just going to say you know

[05:19] Alex is just going to say build a good brand because if you build a good brand then all these other

[05:22] problems go away no shit that's called leverage and so you're like no no I don't want to do the

[05:29] one thing that would solve all my problems I want to try and solve each of my problems individually

[05:35] well that's amazing for you and you should probably get that looked at but the point is is that

[05:41] a good strategist has to look at all available options given the resources they have and say

[05:46] which one of these gets me the most and fundamentally that is leverage next up is the strongest

[05:53] force in all of business and so I believe in this so thoroughly that there are only two concepts

[05:59] that are embedded within the acquisition dot com logo the first is this cross here which is the

[06:06] supply and demand curve that exists in any market the second part is why is this a triangle the

[06:12] triangle is there to exist as a full-crum for leverage and so fundamentally if you can have a supply

[06:19] demand curve that is dramatically in your favor that alone will dictate this if you are the

[06:25] only person who sells this one thing in the entire world wants it you are going to make a lot of money

[06:30] pretty much no matter what doesn't matter how good you are market is matter how good you are at sales

[06:34] pricing you're going to make a ton of money and so I try to think what are the fewest things

[06:39] that have to be true in order for me to win and I would rather just get those things right and then

[06:44] everything else can fall away and so think about this in sequence supply demand is the first and

[06:50] most important thing as long as we have those things then if you had that hypothetical example of the

[06:55] entire world wants something and you're the only one who does it what's the next thing you would need

[06:58] which is leverage you would want to be able to get as much for the effort that you put in because

[07:03] you would get bottlenecked based on maybe your supply chain you'd have other dependencies that

[07:08] would prevent you from capitalizing on the opportunity that the supply demand curve has put in front of you and

[07:14] so in a perfect world you have all of that and unlimited leverage and that allows you to

[07:19] maximally capitalise on opportunities and that is why I design the acquisition dot com logo to

[07:25] exhibit those things now the first piece here is understanding whether your business is

[07:30] a prior demand constraint and so a supply constraint business for example is one that's like

[07:36] cleaning like cleaners often don't have a hard time finding other businesses or other homes

[07:43] to do cleaning for a lot of people just don't want to do it the issue they have is finding staff

[07:49] who can do the cleaning with them or for them so that means that you're a supply side of how you

[07:54] can deliver to the demand is usually the issue and this happens a lot of times with what I would

[07:59] consider a new since services so services that people might know how to do but just don't want to do

[08:05] a different example of this in the professional setting would be like accounting firms accounting firms

[08:10] a lot of people don't want to hire accountants and for a big period of time in a lot of companies

[08:15] growth in the beginning you don't have in-house accounting and so having an out-of-house accountant

[08:20] there's plenty of demand for them the issue they have is recruiting really good accountants and so

[08:25] yet again they are a supply constrained business now this works again with legal it works with

[08:32] high-end consulting like if you're a very good consultant in an inch it's very like easy to get

[08:37] people to want to buy from you very hard to get other people to do what you can do because you're

[08:41] really good at this thing right and so this is very typical and a lot of businesses especially

[08:45] service and so that would be supplied constraint businesses and if that is the constraint then what

[08:51] do we do to gain leverage over the constraint and so this is where okay is there a way that we can

[08:58] build a community of accountants that we can then recruit from is there a way that we can create some

[09:04] sort of environment that attracts more cleaners can our compensation structure can we have a referral

[09:09] system internally for our team or our employees because I know what a cleaner I know what a legal

[09:15] person I know what another consultant is worth to me to my business in total gross profit per year

[09:20] and why would I not be willing to pay 20% of that to somebody now you might do that math and be like

[09:26] holy cow I make 250,000 year per new lawyer who joins my firm it probably will be a lot more than honestly

[09:32] in that case then why would I be unwilling to spend fifty thousand dollars to go and not not only

[09:38] that give that fifty thousand dollars to someone on my team for bringing another great lawyer in

[09:44] and so this scales all the way up and all the way down based on the revenue that each of these

[09:48] high end or supply constraint employees provides the business now those are supply constraint

[09:54] businesses and if you're in one of those you need to recognize it because the real businesses you're in

[09:58] is attracting hiring, training, managing and incentivizing these people to perform that's the real

[10:06] business because the demand kind of takes care of itself of course you have to do the basics but

[10:10] the real issue is going to be on the back and on the front end now let's flip the tables there are some

[10:15] businesses that are demand constraint now demand constraint businesses will be typically like

[10:21] e-commerce businesses oftentimes software businesses specifically be to be software businesses

[10:27] can be demand constraint typical consumer products weight loss for example is a very demand

[10:33] constraint business now this may have sounds wild you like wait I think so many people want to

[10:36] lose weight yeah there's just even more people who supply it and so many different methods for doing it

[10:43] now again all of these things can shift right supply and demand is a curve like it can move right this

[10:48] is dynamic in this video exists in time and unfortunately the environment's change but anybody who's

[10:53] been in fitness would understand that getting customers is actually typically the hardest part finding

[10:58] trainers not that hard there's lots of people that like training and they'll even do it for free

[11:04] same thing with musicians like if you teach music classes right one of the difficulties there is

[11:09] attracting people who want to buy music lessons but there's tons of people who play music and do it for

[11:13] free right and so the idea is which side of this curve are you one and then whatever that side is

[11:19] is asking yourself how can a game more leverage over this problem so that I can solve it at scale

[11:24] once and for all rather than having to solve it continuously over and over and over again so I'll give

[11:29] an example I had a company you came out that we were looking at and they were living on this smaller

[11:35] side but they were a home services company and so the issue they had is they were struggling to

[11:40] attract plumbers and so one of the things that we put in place for the business was well what

[11:46] is a plumber bringing every year and let's call it $400,000 in gross profit okay so if you have a

[11:52] nut a $400,000 that you know you've got the demand for they're turning away business because they're

[11:57] phones ringin too much and they can't even take it what are you willing to pay one time to unlock

[12:03] $400,000 every year in gross profit well if you were to think about that like an investment right

[12:08] which should be like okay I've got this stock that yields $400,000 in gross profit per year to me

[12:14] what would I be willing to pay for it and that's every year? Well should I be at least willing to

[12:18] pay $400,000 if it was a stock right that's a hundred percent return because next year I'm going

[12:22] to make $400,000 too now there is an element of risk that comes into the equation what if the

[12:27] person leaves what if they get fired or if they're not good all of those things so those are

[12:30] for sure there which means that we would then apply some sort of discount to account for that risk

[12:34] but I think that one of the big misconceptions that business owners have is they're not willing to pay

[12:39] enough for talent that is the constraint of their business like right now if you could get 10 more like

[12:44] if you were in a supply-contrain business if you could get 10 more of not not star just appropriately

[12:51] competent employees who could service the demand that you have would that double or triple your business

[12:57] if so yes what would you pay in order to double triple your business probably a lot more than it

[13:03] costs you to attract those people cool than what do we do well the easiest thing is incentivize all the

[13:09] people in your existing workforce to go to that recruiting for you too many business owners will

[13:14] give like a thousand dollar referral bonus on something that makes $400,000 a year in gross profit

[13:18] well that's dumb if if I can give 25,000 dollars away or fifty thousand dollars away and I can get

[13:24] it solved in a month then every month because that $400,000 doesn't happen at once it happens over

[13:28] this period of time and so if I can actually solve the problem two months earlier then that means I

[13:33] get to collect 35,000 dollars for two more months of gross profit okay so there is a time component of this

[13:39] so maybe you can get the referral and maybe it does take you six months instead of three but you

[13:44] missed out on whatever that is 105,000 dollars in gross profit that you could have had had you just

[13:49] been willing to pay a little bit more but still less overall and you still get to keep that person

[13:54] for life so you notice that I'm talking a lot about who in these examples and you know it's one of

[14:00] those big obvious trait responses that everyone who is a senior entrepreneur or senior investor or

[14:08] Warren Buffett or Steve Jobs they all say the same thing it's just about the people right bet on the

[14:13] Joaquin not the horse there's tons of isms in this world and everyone nods along but the

[14:17] problem is that people don't have the context to understand the levels of talent that exist and this is why

[14:22] these mistakes are so hard to bear because you have to have some sort of pattern recognition

[14:27] of having worked with one terrible people to know how to avoid them and then secondarily what

[14:32] star talent looks like and sometimes it takes luck in the beginning and then over time you start

[14:37] recognizing what that looks like so that you can do it on purpose rather than on accident and if you

[14:41] think about people as one of the highest leverage things you can do so think about this as hypothetical

[14:46] if your business had people who could do everything that currently exists and you could simply own it

[14:50] that would mean that you could work zero and make almost the same amount that you do now you'd only

[14:54] have to find someone who could do what you do like literally just think about what you currently make

[14:58] think about what you currently do if you could pay someone less than what you currently make

[15:03] distributions to do 100% of what you currently do you could feasibly retire at your current

[15:08] income level just with that one higher the idea of getting really good people is still undervalued

[15:14] in the marketplace which is why there's always an opportunity for people who know how to attract

[15:19] and retain the best talent there's a reason that the most expensive companies in the world in the

[15:23] stock market are at war for talent I want to say like 18 months ago one of the headlines of I think

[15:28] like the New York Times or something was the talent war and the whole idea was just that it's an

[15:33] onslaught of signing bonuses and kumbaya on free lunch all the stuff to try and attract the top

[15:39] talent because they know that the leverage of having somebody who's a 10x engineer or a 100x

[15:46] marketer for their business is always worth more than what they're going to pay the individual

[15:51] and so they're just doing everything they can to get them and this is me trying to translate

[15:55] that to you in terms of my emphasis over the last year or years that has yielded this outcome

[16:00] if we're thinking about more or less in terms of my focus this is one that I'm doing more of I'm

[16:04] more focused on talent I'm more focused on better people fewer better people and incentivizing them

[16:10] and incentivizing other people to bring them in there some some of the conductor companies that are

[16:14] offering three x salaries their current salary to coach people for one company to another because

[16:18] the cost of switching is obviously high and so if they're making more money than you you should

[16:23] look at what they're doing so next point up for me is of the first hundred days this year I took

[16:27] zero days off and I bring this up because this is very taboo topic and I want to be clear do

[16:33] I'm just saying that when I see the entrepreneurs who are obsessed with their work they do

[16:39] better than people who aren't and it's basically that they're discretionary time that would go to hobbies

[16:45] that would go to other things basically all flows into this one thing and so I'm going to

[16:50] paint a different picture for you if I played video games all day and someone came up to me and said hey

[16:58] why don't you go outside and I say I don't want to go outside I want to keep playing video games

[17:03] the thing is is that that person's making some moral judgment that I should do something that they

[17:08] have projected onto my life now I'm a big believer in personal freedom which is if you want to play

[17:13] video games every hour of every day until the day you die that's your prerogative it's not how I

[17:17] would want to live my life but more power to you if you have an outcome that you're optimizing

[17:22] towards which would be financial wealth which is the kind of the point of my channel the people who work

[17:27] the most tend to make the most money and there's a number of reasons for that so number one is you

[17:32] make more money when you work more because you have less time to spend it that sounds obvious but I

[17:37] think it's like kind of silly like if you work you make more if you stop working you not only don't

[17:43] make you also spend so it's a it's a it's a negative the positive swing it's actually disproportionate

[17:48] the next thing is that a friend of mine message Elon about vacation he's like hey you should

[17:53] go in vacation or we should go here for vacation and Elon's response was I don't do vacations

[17:59] and I was like man I love the sky I bring this up yet again because I feel like the more you

[18:04] get in the game the more addicted to the game you get and I think that addiction is just a term

[18:09] that society uses for activities that people do that have negative consequences rather than

[18:14] simply things that you do on a regular basis well I'm addicted to food because I do it every

[18:18] day I'm addicted to sleep because I do it every day I'm addicted to talking to lay looks I do it every day

[18:22] and so it's just that addictions is when they decide that the outcome of that thing is somehow

[18:26] negative but if the outcome of what I do helps more businesses grow and it's something that I enjoy

[18:31] wise this wrong and so we did two very bad vacations this year one was in July 4th which I

[18:37] ended up basically just traveling and then working all the time so I don't know if I would consider

[18:41] that vacation and then the other one we went to truly do a vacation and so this one was going to be

[18:47] two days and we got there and it was this beautiful luxury resort and there's only 22 villas it's

[18:53] like three or four people per villa like very you know ritsy whatever and I look out on the patio

[18:58] of the villa that we have over the mountains and I'm like man this is beautiful and I don't care

[19:06] and I think it was this realization that even vacations were something that had been passed on to me

[19:11] from someone earlier in my life that I was something that I should do that I must do this or else

[19:18] I will not gain their approval and I will get judgment from people that I care about but when I think

[19:24] about who do I care about who would care about whether or not I go on vacation they're very few

[19:29] and they certainly don't have the things that I want or have accomplished what I would like to accomplish

[19:33] and so why would I listen to them the big conclusion that I've had from this whole thing was

[19:38] maybe vacations aren't for me or maybe they're not for me right now and that's totally okay

[19:43] who made the rule that vacations must exist humans existed for a very long time before vacations were

[19:48] a thing and so the idea that this is a requirement for humans is very foreign and feels

[19:53] societally programmed also takes into the assumption that you have the money for the vacations

[19:59] it's basically a privileged thing that you then cast a projection on a somebody else saying they

[20:04] should exercise this privilege because that's what you would do in their position but maybe the

[20:09] reason you would do it in their position is why you're not in their position and so one of the other

[20:13] things that we did this year is that we traveled significantly less and so this year in total I think

[20:18] we took somewhere in the neighborhood of 12 you know 10 to 12 days off in total and I would

[20:23] define a day off as not working at all that would be a day off and so I would say a work day I would

[20:29] define as more than call it four hours of work as a work day so maybe on the days off I would

[20:34] still consider I work for a few hours but I'll count that as a day off so big picture the increased

[20:38] focus and decrease in change in variables in environment allowed me to work more because I had

[20:45] fewer changing variables that I had to accommodate on a regular basis and so later when I were looking

[20:50] over our calendars yesterday we did a joint podcast going over each month of the year like what we

[20:54] focused on in that month and what was interesting is that we kept swiping through it and it was just like

[20:59] work work work just like an onslaught of things that we did over and over and over again and I can tell

[21:05] you this is that the periods where I've had tremendous financial growth across different companies that

[21:10] I've found it have almost always had these very long periods where I just have to do reps and this is

[21:19] like I'm in a rocky cutscene of my own right now and I know that it's likely going to take

[21:24] three issues and I probably about a year in and I probably have two more years to get to the other side

[21:30] and it's just that I've been on this roller coaster before and I know how the song goes. It's less

[21:35] like weird for me and also I don't have the anxiety of will this be forever. I know it's not going

[21:41] to be forever and I know that it's a season and even if it is forever I have found that it's

[21:46] far more productive for me to work seven days a week, eight to ten hours a day, then it is for me to work

[21:52] five and take two. People have different preferences but for me it's kind of like the summer gap

[21:58] in learning. So when kids take three months off for the summer they have this whole summer catch-up

[22:03] that they have to do which takes like another quarter for them to just get back to where they were.

[22:07] And so if you think about the three months plus the catch-up it's like kids are only like net

[22:11] positive for like six months of the year and the other six months they're not. So basically

[22:15] learning at half speed from an entrepreneur perspective we're incentivized to get as much quality

[22:20] worked on as possible. And so for me I work very well on realistically a 10 to 12 hour

[22:26] day schedule. Obviously there's probably two or three days a week that I'll work 16 to 18

[22:30] but I would say my true average is probably seven days a week of 12 and I'd say weekends are shorter

[22:37] and I probably have two or three days like I said during the week that I probably 18s. And so that

[22:40] gets me somewhere the 90 hours a week range but for me that's actually fairly doable because my

[22:45] wife's here with me I have a gym downstairs. I have all the people that I care about and I care about

[22:50] them because they support me. They take interest in my goals and they want to help me accomplish them.

[22:54] They increase the likelihood that those goals occur and so what else could I ask from someone like

[22:58] for my life like what? I'm very happy with my life and I think that a lot of people take a fence

[23:03] to me being happy about my life because they think that I cast judgment on them living differently.

[23:07] You can do whatever you want. I make this channel because I've been trying to document this since I

[23:10] had nothing all the way to a billion dollars plus and just say what's worked for me. My team has

[23:15] me to clarify this because they're with me. A hundred days straight means no weekends so I just

[23:19] worked the first hundred days of the years so that took me into whatever that is April. So a lot of

[23:23] you hear a hundred days and think oh my god my friends with throw a fit if I worked a hundred days

[23:28] straight. Well if you want better friends then expect to see them less because better friends are busy

[23:35] friends. Better friends are doing things with their lives and I don't know about you but I would rather see

[23:41] someone less frequently who's actually pursuing great things than someone who's always available to

[23:47] see me all the time and has zero material updates because they're in no way growing or getting better

[23:52] because my biggest fear with that they rub off on me and the friends that I have now I can count on one

[23:57] hand and almost all of them are entrepreneur I say almost they're all entrepreneurs and they're all

[24:01] very high level entrepreneurs and we basically stay in touch via text and none of them live in the same

[24:06] status. All of my friends treat text like email which is like we text and none of us have an

[24:13] expectation of response that's like oh I can't believe you didn't respond to my text for three days.

[24:17] It is super normal for each of my friends to have not responded to me and for me not to respond to them

[24:22] for days at a time and none of us blow up and have a tantrum because we know the other person's busy

[24:30] and they'll get to it when they get to it. So with on the on the on the back end of that

[24:35] serious note fun things did happen this year and so I ended up buying acq.com 3 lettered

[24:41] domain from yaho and so they'd own that since 1998 or 90 second number of it was 1998

[24:48] they'd owned it for like 26 years something like that and I finally was able to restlet from there

[24:55] from their grip and so that was really cool for those of your curious who's $480,000 to buy the

[24:59] domain. I don't buy a lot of crazy shit and I'm allowed to spend my money how a rye won't spend it

[25:05] and I think acq.com is dope and so on the back end of that part of the reason I did that was because

[25:10] we just stood up acq ventures so really proud of that it's primarily focused on SaaS and tech enabled

[25:17] services the reason that we're doing it is basically because our family office which functions

[25:22] like a private equity but it's a family office and that we don't have outside LPs or limited partners

[25:27] people who give us money so we don't have any people who give us money it's all our money which is

[25:30] why it's a family office but in terms of the day to day most family office is 10 to be passive we're

[25:33] very active in our investments and we take significantly larger positions and so we stood this up

[25:39] because we have a tremendous amount of people who who are entrepreneurs who meet through the

[25:44] very things that we do that would like investment they would like help but they don't want to

[25:49] necessarily hand over control or head over have that level of engagement and so we stood up acq ventures

[25:54] because there's just honestly a ton of demand for a different capital structure for our investments

[26:00] we just did our first three deals in acq ventures I think should finalize the next week or two so before

[26:04] the end of the year kind of cool and so that will be a much higher volume deal side for

[26:10] acquisition.com and that branch will just be on the venture side well speaking of big things that I

[26:14] did this year I worked a crazy amount on the $100 million scaling roadmap and it's yours for free

[26:20] and I'll tell you how to get it right now I did it across all the departments so the departments were

[26:24] sales marketing customer service product IT HR recruiting and finance and so what problem

[26:32] existed every level and I've broken into 10 stages and what you need to do to graduate from that level

[26:37] so you can literally just look at your own business and see what things you're missing what

[26:40] things you're lagging on maybe sometimes what things you're ahead on because it's very neat to put

[26:45] these things into 10 stages but reality is messy and so it's more that you'll be at stage five you'll

[26:50] have some things that you're at stage seven on and some things that you're at stage three on

[26:53] but those stage three things will likely be things that you will need to fix sooner than the things

[26:58] that your stage seven on right and so it's very much the constraints concept where you have a

[27:01] weak link and this helps you see where you're the furthest behind so you kind of up level those things

[27:06] faster and so I just dropped the training it's at acquisition.com for its last training and so if you

[27:12] want to write down the link this is it it's acquisition.com for its last training and just click the

[27:20] $100 scale road map and you can go there we also have a little button there that you can get a

[27:25] personalized plan made for you so you just answer some questions and we'll tell you what stage you are

[27:30] at and we'll give you the one before and the one after so you know what you should be finished and

[27:33] we have a line of sight too. It's absolutely free you just go there and enjoy it's 14 hours you

[27:38] don't need to watch the whole thing just watch the section that's that specific to your business right now.

[27:42] So big thing right now is growth trends so I think this might be one of the most valuable sections

[27:48] of this video for you guys and historically when I would do my podcast recap of the year it was

[27:54] always my most popular episode and so I'm just doing it on YouTube but these are the things that I

[27:58] would say we learned or that we doubled down on in the portfolio that yielded really good results.

[28:02] So number one is we focused a lot on leadership talent recruiting all right so I you call this key

[28:09] player recruiting and the big thing here is that I just kind of switch my perspective on this which is

[28:16] fundamentally if you listen to Steve Jobs you listen to Bayes O's you listen to Zuckerberg a lot of

[28:20] them take a hugely active role in bringing in top talent and so my understanding of talent has been

[28:26] the probably the single largest shift that I've had this year in terms of my understanding of business

[28:30] and why I think that we're disproportionately growing across the portfolio the companies that are

[28:33] doing the best or the ones that we've been able to place key players and part of that is being

[28:39] willing as the CEO as the founder to actively show interest in these types of people and they are

[28:45] the type of people that would not respond to traditional recruiter because they are either so good

[28:51] it what they do and they want to know that their investment in the companies can be valuable.

[28:55] These are not the type of people who feel like you're giving them an opportunity to work for you.

[29:00] These are the types of people that they're giving you the opportunity of helping build your business

[29:05] bringing their entire roll decks of people they already know teams that sometimes they can they can

[29:10] bring with them and just a huge stack of skills that ideally should disproportionately benefit the

[29:16] business and fundamentally this is one of the highest leverage things that you can do because at the

[29:21] most basic level what you need to do as a CEO is attract the absolute best people and align

[29:28] incentives ruthlessly for them to work and then get out of their way and so that was probably

[29:33] that the one of the biggest ones. Number two was was focus. All right now I talk about focus a lot

[29:39] so I'm going to try and say this in a different way than I normally do. It's really top-down focus

[29:44] and prioritization which is just another word for strategy but just how much more important strategy is

[29:50] for businesses because what happens is when they pursue too many paths they get they look up a

[29:55] year later and they haven't grown much at all and if you're a small business like you absolutely can

[30:00] double triple quadruple five X every year for a few years before sometimes that'll slow down. If you have

[30:05] a compounding mechanism it could even keep going and getting faster. At the very least like growing a

[30:09] 10% a year again there's nothing wrong with that but if you're at a million bucks a year or five

[30:13] million bucks a year even ten million dollars a year like you should be able to grow a lot faster than that

[30:17] and typically it's because you lack people and because you lack focus and when I say people it means

[30:22] you lack good enough people the people you have you might have a high-heat count but a low talent count

[30:28] and focus you might have lots of priorities but they're the wrong ones and so fundamentally if you can't

[30:33] focus on one thing one objective that is most important that makes the rest of your objectives less

[30:40] important then you are not doing your job as the CEO to tell the team how they should be allocating their

[30:47] attention and that and here's the important part is deleting everything that is not this and so a lot of

[30:55] people like these are objectives also keep doing everything else so you can't do that you can't just

[31:00] add more because now you you've even further deluded what's important now for sure people need to continue

[31:05] transacts sales guys don't need to sell customer service still needs to service but the discretionary

[31:09] effort that exists in the top talent the leaders of the company who aren't as involved in the

[31:13] day to day and are basically all times they have between aligning teams should be dedicated to a

[31:20] single priority that if accomplished would be an order of magnitude improvement in the business and so

[31:25] this level of focus is what I continue to drill with the founders and the CEOs of the portfolio

[31:31] companies and it has yielded outsized returns and there's a great razor for this which is when I

[31:36] want to fix a system or when I go into a department the first thing I do is eliminate as much as

[31:41] you really possible and here's the thing is people are afraid of eliminating meetings eliminating

[31:45] communication lines and eliminating processes but if you eliminate just about everything you'll find out

[31:50] that the vast majority of that stuff was complete waste and complete distraction and here's the cool thing

[31:55] you can always add it back so there's this fear of loss people literally have fear of loss around

[32:00] processes and meetings which is ridiculous but that's just how we're wired psychologically which is why

[32:05] companies in general as they grow create bloat there's too many people doing too many things that

[32:11] don't matter or not enough stuff to begin with and all of them together don't know how what they

[32:17] do makes the company money and so one of the easiest tasks that you can do is zoom all the way out

[32:23] and think what is the output of this department what is the output of finance have you ever thought about

[32:28] like what is the output of finance the output of finance is information to make decisions that's it and so

[32:34] if you're getting too much information or you're getting the wrong information or the information

[32:38] that you're getting doesn't change your decisions then the function of finance is inadequate

[32:42] you're not getting enough of what you need of output from that department if the function of

[32:47] IT is to gather stored display and analyze information then are you getting the correct data are you

[32:52] able to analyze it are you able to display it and see in real time and be able to make decisions of it

[32:58] also another information output to part of it kind of interesting right so many of these departments

[33:03] really exist just to have information to make decisions and so I bring this up because you have to

[33:08] delete until you have the fewest things that matter it's like you want to cut to the bone you don't

[33:12] want to cut to fat or come must you want to go all the way to the bone and then add the few things

[33:16] that matter most back in and I think that I'm doing this better now because honestly I think

[33:21] I'm just more ruthless and I think I care less about judgments of other people I think I'm honestly

[33:27] I think it's just like I'm more confident what I'm doing now and so it's like I think I can

[33:30] sexually felt the same way I just was like this feels crazy even though it makes sense to me and so

[33:37] fundamentally first principles thinking operates from this perspective of like okay physics or laws

[33:42] that we have to obey what else do we have to obey the law of the land so we've got government laws

[33:47] that we have to obey besides that tell me a physical law or government law that prevents us from

[33:52] doing this thing in one tenth the time tell me the law if not then there is a way and here's the thing

[33:57] is that there will simply be resources that are required and so one of the things that I'm trying

[34:01] to get my team to understand is if I asked to do something and they say we can't do it that's saying

[34:06] it's impossible and it's ridiculous and of course they're wrong so it's a terrible position to take

[34:10] it's also very frustrating instead tell me what it would take tell me the resources that would be

[34:16] required that we'd have to take from something else and then we together can decide whether it's

[34:21] worth the trade so for example if my whole media team I said hey I want to make a motion

[34:27] picture for example right I'm not saying I would have to do that let's say that we decided that was a

[34:31] big a big strategic party if we were to get one big motion picture that was as big as avatar

[34:36] that it would be you know maybe it would do things for the business okay then they might say well we can't

[34:40] do that now implicit in that statement is we can't do that and keep making content at the at the

[34:46] level that we're at so then we'd say okay well if we allocated all the resources and stop making

[34:51] content and we actually were able to get a feature like film with the existing media team

[34:55] would the benefit of that be worth the cost and if it is then great we'll do it but a lot of times

[35:02] we get it we get a soft no immediately out the gate rather than a what it would take and this is

[35:06] been one of the biggest shifts that I think as empowered me is asking better questions and so

[35:11] one of the most frequently asked questions that I will probably my question of the year is what it

[35:16] take and by doing this the reason I think it's such a power for question it also works for deals it works

[35:20] for sales it works for anything is that it assumes the result occurs it assumes success and so because

[35:28] it assumes success you work backwards from the reality that you want to create rather than

[35:32] forwards trying to figure it out as you go I'll tell you something funny so we had a company that we were

[35:38] looking at and in the diligence process I said hey you've got this downsell basically no and takes

[35:43] it have you considered just giving it away for free to get more leads and then it up doing it

[35:49] and they tripled their lead flow the next week and so that downsell was worth maybe 5% of revenue

[35:56] but what's the value of tripling lead flow tripling revenue and probably disproportionately dropping

[36:00] to the bottom line so tripling really triple lead flow so it would cut cack by two thirds but fundamentally

[36:06] it would triple the business and so there are so many of these little things that exist inside of

[36:11] companies and just being focused enough to say no this is our core product this is where you make

[36:16] all of them money anything that's not that distracts us from making this thing better so theme number

[36:21] three was CRO and so I'd say this year the companies that made the biggest gains had a discipline

[36:29] around conversion rate optimization and so that means that at any given point they're running

[36:35] three to ten different split tests on the key parts of the pipeline for revenue generation meaning

[36:42] if you have a landing page where you get a lot of traffic or you have a home page you get a lot of

[36:46] traffic or you have a follow-up sequence that a huge percentage of customers are in actually testing

[36:50] things out there so one of the companies we had had three CRO improvements and this was the largest

[36:57] company we have in the portfolio so we got a plus 20% CRO test improvement which is a mass a monster

[37:03] win especially at the level of optimization in this company isn't so we're talking eight figures

[37:07] plus a month in revenue like it's a big company and so 20% lift is huge but on top that we got

[37:13] 50% lift and then we got a 28% lift so we had three mega wins now the question is how many

[37:20] split tests that we have to do for that I mean probably a hundred but the thing is is that that was

[37:24] basically one guy and a couple devs split basically running these sprints on a regular basis but

[37:31] how valuable is that to the company tremendously valuable because things that are efficiency

[37:36] improvements typically are long lasting which cool about that is that when you have an efficiency

[37:41] improvement it means your altitude of cat ratio expands which allows you to spend more money

[37:46] in advertising more money in talent acquisition all the way around the business it literally just

[37:50] makes the business stronger and is a competitive mode and so I'll give you a little hack that is worth

[37:55] looking at which is many businesses integrate third-party tools into your processes right you've got

[38:01] a hundred different software that you probably pay for what none of those software is typically

[38:06] advertised is what their conversion rate is and so if anything is customer facing that a prospect

[38:12] might interact with I would look at three or four other tools within the exact same use case

[38:18] and see which one has a higher conversion rate on the UX so the user experience I think you will get

[38:23] disperportion it returns on that it's typically a heavier lift because splitting between multiple

[38:28] tools is a pain in the ass but I've seen monster lifts there so those are the three probably

[38:34] biggest themes which was people focus and then optimization around the things that worked really

[38:40] well across the portfolio in 2025 now the next part is okay what are the detractors right these are

[38:46] things that grew those businesses but what are some of the things that hurt those businesses and so

[38:51] I actually see this as the personal stuff all right so we had a few entrepreneurs that I think

[38:57] took their foot off the gas they started making more money than they'd been accustomed to and we're

[39:00] like this is good enough and so this is where having you know some people call it a big reason why

[39:05] you can have whatever you want as long as you change your behavior how to really care whether it's

[39:08] a big reason why or you just change but either way you have to find something that's going to

[39:13] keep driving you so for me it's the love of the game I just enjoy business and so I spend all my time

[39:18] doing business some people don't enjoy businesses much and so it either has to be some mission that you

[39:22] have around the problem that you solve like it actually has to let you up otherwise you will make

[39:26] enough money and you'll stop pushing that now again if you capture girls it's amazing that's great

[39:31] again I make my channel for people who just want to consistently grow consistently grow in personal

[39:35] development and using money is just a stick for seeing how how far how far you've you've stacked

[39:40] your skills right also not saying that money is a it is a virtue or having money is a virtue just

[39:45] saying that in general you start you become more skilled and you can measure how skilled you are in the

[39:49] game of business by the money you make now here's one that's going to be uncorfered for a lot of people

[39:54] is spouses and or partners and so one of the big detractors believe it or not and I've seen this and this is a

[40:01] big focus at Lailin Eye have across the team is how much support do the key players on your team

[40:10] and or the entrepreneurs have from their spouses and so you basically have the worst type of spouse

[40:18] which is a spouse who actively decreases the likelihood of your girls so they are constantly reminding

[40:22] you of the negatives that exist they're trying to costly distract you say hey stop working stop talking

[40:27] about that let's do this instead so not only do they try to get you to stop working they try and

[40:30] incentivize you by doing something else and so it's reversing a negative antipostative it's like a double

[40:35] whimmy and the thing is is that I want to be clear I don't think there's malicious intention here

[40:39] but the result of what they do still massively damages the business like if you were to think of an

[40:44] enemy what would an enemy do they were trying to get you to not think about the business and then

[40:48] do something else that you get addicted to instead it's almost like going to your competitor

[40:52] and be like try some heroin I think you might like it what occurs is more or less the same and again

[40:57] I'm not talking about intention here I'm just talking about what happens and so when we look back

[41:01] so we did like a retroactive analysis of this of like who are the stars who just crushed and kept

[41:06] crying they were the ones who had absolute spouse or support who are like if they need to work late

[41:11] they need to work the weekends I'll pack them with a lunch um you know I'm a here at home and this

[41:15] happened for husbands and wives both sides the ones who where you had somebody who came in

[41:20] who presented like a star but then eventually fizzled was typically because and this is where

[41:24] it's so nefarious is that they would get into a relationship at some point or they they would

[41:29] upgrade the relationship like they'd move in together or something like that and that person

[41:33] would have a disproportionate effect on the entrepreneur and so what's really interesting is that

[41:38] entrepreneurs are typically we're so concerned with our surroundings we want in our space who's

[41:43] good who's helping us out and then for some reason the person who has a point seven one correlation

[41:48] with your subjective well-being the person will probably have the largest influence on your behavior

[41:52] in your life you don't hold to the same standard and I find that crazy but it happens all the time

[41:56] and just because everyone else doesn't doesn't mean that it makes sense it's also why most

[42:00] people are mediocre I think that one is that if you're looking to bring a high level person

[42:04] onto the team I would consider talking to their spouse just makes just gauge their interest level

[42:09] see if they're supportive like in the middle they're neutral but I think neutral becomes negative

[42:12] over time so you need someone who's active who's who's who when when the employee inevitably

[42:18] has a bad day because everyone does they say hey this is a great job this is great for us as a

[42:23] family like you got this I trust you I believe and you I support you what can I do to help tell me

[42:29] how I can make this easier for you that is the type of support you want whereas if you have

[42:34] somebody who says let's leave work outside it's home now and I don't want to hear about that

[42:39] let's do all this other stuff instead that sounds innocent the problem is that it decreases the

[42:44] likely they win and again I know this will be controversial so you know take it to leave it again

[42:49] my two cents you can tell me to shove it it's up to you let's talk about the next big one so

[42:53] in creating that scaling roadmap that I was talking about earlier I wanted to create like a

[42:57] micro cycle that I felt had to exist within every process right and so I'm going to break down

[43:03] two different processes that are different one is scaling the others optimization all right so I'm

[43:08] going to walk through both so whenever you have a system you'll typically start as the first step

[43:14] so whatever you're doing you want to start out you have to start number one S then you have C

[43:18] which is compound all right so you have to do more okay great we're doing more the next is augment

[43:26] so how do we do better then we have leverage which is how do we make it consistent right how do we

[43:34] automate it and so I'll just I'll make this a little infinite thing and then finally how do we expand

[43:40] again and so this is actually a loop between the two steps so you start and then you do more

[43:49] and then once you do more you try to get better once you get better and you know what works you try

[43:54] and automate it and make you consistent and have low volatility and then you expand to the next

[43:59] territory you spend an external you expand to the next type of content you expand to the next

[44:04] product the same process and it's nice because it has this little it's got this nice acronym

[44:10] SCALE and so it actually fit in there I'll super pumped about that and so now when I think about

[44:16] what someone has to do next with an apartment I'll think okay where they at okay they just start

[44:20] this thing so they just need to do more they've done a lot okay so maybe there's probably a lot of

[44:24] ways so now we probably should do better how can we augment how can we streamline how to optimize

[44:28] once they're doing better it's like okay they're doing really well but there's more to man

[44:31] that's coming in how can we make this consistent how can we automate this or portions of this work and

[44:36] then finally once we have this thing airtight we're like cool how can we do this again and we expand

[44:40] if we're thinking about this within the context of content it's like we start posting on a channel

[44:44] then we say okay well one post a day works can we do three post a day so we do more then we're like hey

[44:48] some of these post you better than others how can we make our post better and then we say cool what

[44:52] percentage of these processes can we use AI for what things can we prep we can basically make better

[44:57] happen more easily and more consistent how can we make it instead of having you know one do 10k views and

[45:02] one have a million views how can we get all of them over 100k how can we all of them over 250k and then

[45:08] finally we're like okay I think we've maxed out this specific channel how do we now go to TikTok how do we

[45:13] take this process and go to Snapchat or whatever so it works for anything now the second process

[45:17] that's about scaling this is about optimization and so this is typically when you come in and

[45:22] fix something that already exists and so I got to have a lot of experience with this this year because

[45:27] I took over media and conversion within acquisition.com and I haven't operated day to day probably

[45:32] like five years and so it was actually a ton of fun for me because honestly it's just like I've

[45:36] developed a lot of skills to last time operated and it's been great so anyways the first thing is

[45:41] you question the requirements and I got this framework from Elon and it's freaking awesome so

[45:46] question the requirements why are we doing everything that we're doing please explain to me how does

[45:50] this thing relate to this output and this is why to finding what each department is supposed to

[45:54] create is so valuable you're the content team the goal here is to make as much good

[45:58] content as should be possible anything that does not facilitate, content creation in terms of

[46:02] volume and quality is waste if you're an engineering team it's like you have code that you must

[46:06] type which then creates software that people can use and we want the quality that software to be

[46:10] really high and so anything that does not relate to those things are things that are waste so

[46:14] we question why we do everything the second was you kind of get lay of the land after question

[46:18] is you delete and you delete because the next few steps are going to be adding resources to the

[46:23] system and so you delete everything that doesn't matter so the first step that I did when I took

[46:27] over the media team was I deleted all meetings now to be clear it doesn't mean that we're never

[46:32] gonna have meetings again it just means that I will find out which meetings matter and then we

[46:35] will add those in proportionally and so I said you can have ad hoc discussions about clear things but

[46:39] otherwise I'm I'm canceling the recurring meetings and it replaced all team meetings all one

[46:43] on ones with just a daily huddle that way basically the entire day and these were also

[46:48] deep workers so everyone who's creating content really just wants to get into flow and anything

[46:52] that prevents flow massively impacts their performance and so it's like the solution of just adding

[46:57] more people and adding more meetings just gets more people to not work it's terrible and most people

[47:01] also hate it most people want to work and so once you delete then you optimize which is

[47:07] saying okay what of the things that we're doing right now get us the most results what is what

[47:12] of these things that get us the release results what are the resources required to do them

[47:16] as in like time spent or money spent in order to get it and then we optimize it so we say

[47:20] the things that give us the most for the least we put it's the first party the next thing that gets

[47:24] us you know the most for the most we put it's the second party the things that get us a very little

[47:27] amount that cost a lot we put at the end we're just basically gonna not do this things and so you

[47:32] re optimize the actual processes once you've deleted everything else then you pull up timelines

[47:38] you say how can you make this happen faster how can we do this in one tenth the time and what's

[47:42] crazy is that you honestly can increase the speed of things by five x ten x it happens it really it's

[47:48] it's mind blowing when you do it because you're like I can't believe how much we've had this whole time

[47:53] all you do is when you ask questions you say how many hours does that take and so then someone's going to

[47:58] respond with how many hours sticks so rather than this is the classic instead of doing end of week

[48:03] deadlines you just make it end of day and so if a team is used to delivering something to a

[48:08] team meeting every Monday and you say cool how many hours does it take great let's have it done by

[48:12] the end of today you seven x the speed of that team seven x and so some people can't comprehend

[48:18] how one company can grow as so much faster rate than others and it's because of this resource

[48:22] allocation they pull up time good drivers make things happen faster because companies like have if

[48:28] you accomplish a goal 100 years who cares time is a huge function of business if you don't have

[48:32] a process around pulling up timelines consistently then here's why it's so important because if you

[48:36] have time today like let's say there's more utilization on the team like you get they have bad

[48:40] way and you pull stuff up and they're like hey we don't need that for another week like why

[48:43] you why are you making me do it by the end of today because we don't know what's going to happen next week

[48:48] and we might have a priority next week that we do need to get end of day and then when that happens

[48:52] we still won't have done this other thing and now we have to do the other one so this other

[48:55] things now two weeks delayed and so basically you want to use up all available resources that are

[49:02] renewable on a consistent basis to get the highest return so I want to make sure like you

[49:06] understand the argument there because you're going to have to tell it to your team the reason I'm going

[49:09] to drive this outcome even though there's no apparent outside urgency is because it assumes that the

[49:16] future is going to be exactly like today and one of the things I can guarantee is that the future won't

[49:21] be and that there will be things that you didn't expect and when that day comes you will want to have

[49:26] all of the things that you've accomplished behind you supporting you and have as many resources

[49:31] as you can possibly possibly allow you to deploy in that moment because the most adaptable

[49:37] player in the system survives that is what survival of the fittest means within the context of

[49:41] business is the most adaptable player the most flexible and so the final step here is

[49:47] automate same is before and so this is what you look at when you're trying to fix something or

[49:51] turn something around or make it better all right this is when you're trying to scale something

[49:54] I can probably come up with something cute around optimized but as too many letters all right

[49:58] and so hopefully those two frameworks give you two different ways to look at department so

[50:03] you come in and you're like okay it's a scale thing so we need to more we need to do better we need to

[50:06] make a reliable or automated portion of it or we do a new to expand or is this everything screwed up

[50:10] why are we doing what we're doing okay delete all that stuff optimize the things that get us the

[50:14] most outcome pull up time requirements then automate having these types of frameworks to solve

[50:18] problems makes life so much easier which is why share it with you so the next one is about

[50:22] success and failure and knowing why so professional Bergman from Stanford has this statement where he says

[50:27] it's better to fail and know why you failed than to succeed and not now notwithstanding the outcome

[50:32] itself but he's talking about you as an individual it's better to know why you want why you lost than

[50:36] not know why you want because you can't learn anything from it essentially it means that the

[50:39] success of truly chance right which means you can't repeat it and so Edison you know had

[50:43] 10,000 ways not to know how to make a lightball right it's the same kind of idea like

[50:46] if as long as you learn from your failures on a long-term rise and then you don't give up you will

[50:50] win period and so an expert you can find as somebody who's made all the mistakes that you can

[50:53] possibly make in a very nearer field and so fundamentally that's what we want to be within our

[50:57] businesses and so within that context I have now spoken to a lot of business owners because we

[51:03] started this workshop division so we could meet more businesses so we could do acq ventures

[51:06] and obviously within the main portfolio and that you're noticing I'm lining up a lot of sheets

[51:10] here so there are what I call the six horsemen of of business stagnation and so if you are

[51:18] stuck this is for you so there are six reasons that I've seen that have been continuous rocket hard

[51:23] place in areas and the reason that business owners get stuck here is because you have to choose

[51:27] between two apparently impossible choices one is pain today the other is pain forever and both of them

[51:33] sting and that's why people just weighed water in pain because hurts a little bit less to keep

[51:38] pain forever than have a lot of short-term pain now so these are the big six so number one

[51:45] is being underpriced this is how it presents a business owner is at close to full capacity

[51:50] so like let's say they they provide some services and they're like I can't I can't work any

[51:54] more than I already have or my team can't work anymore than it already is and and this is the

[51:59] key point and we're not making money so when that occurs they want to look at all these

[52:03] different things but the problem is you're just mispriced now there's the fear that if I raise my

[52:08] price I will lose my customers and then it will get worse right but the thing is is that I

[52:14] have I have I have I have shepherded so many businesses through price raises that it makes me sick

[52:19] and the process of raising price works like this you get to the price and then you say a higher number

[52:25] and you keep going up until people stop buying that is how you do it in the back of

[52:30] neck and redneck logic way that I prefer most times if you're in that situation you get to pick

[52:37] do you want to have a few people say no and you make more money or do you want to be barely above

[52:42] water and not be able to expand forever because the reason you can't expand the business because

[52:47] you don't have cash for you don't have cash because your prices are wrong and so we need to fix the price

[52:51] once we fix the price will free up cash with the freed up cash we can't expand any locations

[52:56] we can hire that key person that you need to bring in number one if you are full capacity and you

[53:02] aren't making money you need to raise your price and easy way to do it is every five plus 20 all right

[53:08] so I actually got this from lifting weights it's the reverse of this which is once you increase

[53:14] volume by 20% bump your intensity up by five meaning add five pounds right or five percent right so

[53:19] bump volume by 20 bump intensity by five and then volume will drop again but now you have higher

[53:24] intensity and so it's this kind of balanced progression process it's just a very simple one

[53:29] but it actually works the same way for price and so it's like you sell five customers if they all say

[53:33] yes to that price or around the same percentage or you net more money overall you bump the price

[53:37] by 20% and do it again and you just keep doing the five five and 20 keep doing five and 20 until

[53:43] eventually not enough people are saying yes that you're netting less money now the problem is

[53:47] if you have small sales numbers it's harder to hear no more often because your brain isn't going to

[53:53] calculate the fact that you made 20% more it's going to be binary and it's thinking of like it was

[53:58] a yes or no and the thing is is that if you sell three people at twice the price it's better than

[54:04] selling five people at half the price but you're going to hear no more often and so it's going to

[54:09] hurt more but it is better for the business for two reasons one you actually make more money

[54:13] secondly and this is the big one people forget you also have fewer people to service so you have less

[54:18] cost and more revenue which those two things together create a disproportionate increase in profit

[54:24] big thing number one fix your price so the second big problem is over compensation

[54:31] now what I mean by this is actually paying people not like your over compensating for stuff okay

[54:36] this typically happens when you have a set of employees specially in service businesses where you

[54:40] accidentally in the beginning give some sort of revenue share or something like that so it doesn't

[54:45] matter you can't out earn it right like if you grow the business they just grow the revenue like

[54:49] you you you over compensate them where you miss compensate them and maybe you did that in the

[54:53] beginning because the revenue was really low and never thought you get to where you're at now and then

[54:57] your big fear right each one of these has a rock and hard place in there the big fear is if I tell them

[55:01] that they're going that I have to change the compensation they're going to leave and the answer is

[55:06] maybe but if you don't you'll never grow so what are you gonna do right you have to over you have to

[55:10] go through the short term pain to get the long term game and so the process that I'd recommend

[55:15] doing number one is you shore up the infrastructure which means that you bring someone else in

[55:18] that can do the same thing as that person and do it at the new price that you want to pay them for

[55:24] then you can have the conversation with them with more leverage and saying hey the market is this

[55:29] I'm paying you this I understand this is what I need to pay you in order for us to accomplish our goals

[55:33] which is what I sold you on is that we want to accomplish this big vision with the business now

[55:37] I understand that isn't like I'm changing expectations and so go home talk to your wife sleep on it

[55:42] and come back tomorrow if you want to stay here for that compensation I'll give you delay so this is the

[55:48] key part as you say hey I'll keep paying you this for the next two months or three months whatever

[55:52] and after that then you'll go to this new kind of compensation philosophy now if they come back and say

[55:59] no I feel under appreciated bubblebot and that's fine and the good news is you already have somebody

[56:02] used right there ready to go that's the second big issue the third big problem and this is a big one

[56:08] is this is really common when you're smaller so I'd say sub three million this is you guys all right

[56:12] serve too many I'll just say infinite avatars all right meaning you serve too many customers and what

[56:19] happens is all these different people have different demands and so they are telling you all these

[56:24] different things and you can't get your offer right you can't get your advertising right

[56:28] because you're serving too many people now again what's the rock and hard place in your

[56:32] area well if I get narrower on my avatar I'm gonna sell fewer customers and I'm getting all these

[56:37] other people well to me number one is if you fix your messaging you will attract more of the

[56:43] but you haven't been willing to take that bet the alternative is you can try and be after

[56:46] everything to everyone which you know isn't going to work because it's what you're already doing

[56:50] and you know it's not working and so you have the evidence that your your existing path is going to

[56:54] stagnate you and so again the impossible choice is do you want to keep stagnating forever and maybe

[56:59] you make somebody know but it's preventing you from growing or are you willing to and that business

[57:03] is about risk like you have to be comfortable with risk like you this is going to all of these are

[57:07] risks but the alternative is you never risk and you stay exactly where you are and so for me that is

[57:11] a much greater risk it's like when you get into investing anything you invest money into can go

[57:16] down so you incur that risk but if you never invest you absolutely will never get wealthy

[57:20] so what are you going to do right you have to take the small risk so that you avoid the much larger

[57:25] long-term risk and each of these is small short-term risk to avoid large long-term risk so

[57:32] here you have to niche down who you're serving which you do by 8020 so that means you

[57:37] look at all of your customers and you say what are the top 20 percent who are these people

[57:41] what do they do where are they from and you say how do I make this my message and how do I

[57:48] make it offer that's only for them that they would go nuts for and here's the part people miss

[57:53] and price it accordingly so if you have customers that you provide five times the value to and

[57:58] I'm sure you do have those people well all of a sudden if you were to turn some of these

[58:03] bad ones away then your price could reflect the value that you serve to only that much narrower

[58:08] avatar and that's okay and that's great so you may yet again and by the way this is the point

[58:14] make more money all of these are counterintuitive which is why people get stuck the next one

[58:19] the next rock-and-hard place scenarios is overextension all right so this one is you know

[58:26] Alex's Alex's favorite this is Alex's greatest hits of mistakes is me trying to take on too many things

[58:32] I have a plate that's this big and I try and I start putting food on the table because I can't

[58:36] fit it in the plate and typically this is where you get ahead of your skis where you open that second

[58:41] location when the first location isn't really operating as much as well as you think it is and as soon

[58:45] as you go there the revenue from the first one drops you're like oh but a lot of that was my profit and so

[58:50] you've got these fixed costs the revenues down and then you've got this one but this one's new so it's not

[58:54] doing as well as the first one was and your start person's there but you're not there it's an

[58:58] irisplaying between two locations and you're like oh man now I'm actually making the same

[59:02] as I was with one but now I have twice the risk and you're like oh you know what the solution should

[59:05] be I'll open a third and then between the three now your profit goes down even more and now you're

[59:10] not making any money but you have three locations and you have three times the risk and you're

[59:13] stressed out of your mind so what do you do honestly you have two solutions you either have to

[59:18] hire incredibly impressive people which means that you're going to probably give up your income

[59:23] in order to bring this person on or you have to cut your losses you have to prune the tree you

[59:28] have to re-concentrate get it right and then scale back out again the right way and so over

[59:33] extension is typically a who problem which is you don't have enough good people that you left

[59:37] behind who can actually run it without you and so this happens a lot of times in like the one to

[59:42] three million dollars range happens at all ranges but a lot there because when you get there you typically

[59:49] suck yourself out of the day today you're not you're not you're not actually selling people you're

[59:52] not doing customer service and you're not doing delivery but the issue is you think that because

[59:58] you're not involved in the acquisition and delivery that you're not required to run the business

[60:04] but the thing is is that you work every hour of the day right now and so if you work every

[60:08] other day but you're not selling and you're not delivering that it means you're doing other stuff

[60:11] and that other stuff you're doing is very much operating the business and so a lot of owners

[60:16] will mistakenly think that CEO and owner mean the same thing you happen to be both but they are

[60:21] not the same and so right now is you leave so it's like the CEO leaves the business and all

[60:26] of a sudden the business stops running as well because the CEO's gone so you have to have someone

[60:31] who's going to operate behind you you have to basically backfill yourself and in my opinion I

[60:36] like a six month test and the very least do up a one month test which is go away for a month

[60:41] and you hand your phone you show your phone to your operator and you say hey here's the deal you're

[60:44] going to get this override on the business so a little profit share whatever some stock and in doing

[60:50] that I'm doing this in exchange for this not ringing that's the deal and if this rings then that's

[60:55] not the deal and so it's like then you roleplay it out so it's like let's say a pipest what do you do

[61:01] if it's call you wrong answer because what do you think I'm going to do I'm going to call a plumber

[61:04] so what are you going to do just call the plumber directly you don't need to call me to call the plumber

[61:07] same idea if it's an emergency call 911 if it's not an emergency don't call me

[61:13] either way don't call me and so this is the trade so if you're overextended you either

[61:18] got to dip into your own paycheck to bring someone in or you got to prune the tree,

[61:22] reconstitrate and then build it back right and the six month test that I was looting to is

[61:27] the business has to either maintain or grow for six straight months without your direct involvement

[61:32] now that last point is the big one without your direct involvement now some of you're going to run

[61:36] that test still continue to work in the day to day for six months and then say oh I think I did it

[61:40] but you just didn't change what you did at all and the business continued operate with you

[61:43] CEO which is not the case you just delay six months and then you open the next location well

[61:47] which is still making you a little bit better in terms of your cash position but not my recommendation

[61:51] so what's what's what's number five so number five is more than one business so this is also an

[61:58] Alex special I have a lot of specials here four and five are my my personal favorites

[62:03] that I've made the most often which is you've got two businesses or you've got three businesses

[62:08] because you don't know how to pick and you operate from the fall see that Zuckerberg had a side hustle

[62:12] Zuckerberg was also flipping Airbnb's and doing wholesale alongside right that's how you build Facebook of

[62:17] course not one of these businesses is the business you should be doing and the thing is is that the

[62:22] opportunity is the problems that you need to solve and aren't is not in the missed opportunities

[62:27] it's the problems that need to be solved right it's the hairy work that you're not sure what the answer

[62:31] is but you know you need to fix it that is where the opportunity is because fundamentally if the

[62:34] product we're exceptional and everybody loved it you wouldn't have an issue be going all in on that business

[62:38] and so if that's the case then just do it now you're going to have this some cost fall see if

[62:43] like already put all this money to this and already already got it going and already have a partner there

[62:46] yes short term risk you lose relationship you lose maybe short term income from that from that business

[62:53] long term risk you never grow any of these things standing material size because you're too

[62:57] distracted pick again do it everyone but i'm just saying these are these are the most common ones

[63:03] and then finally we've got no data daddy all right no data papa so with no data daddy the issue is

[63:11] you don't even know what your problem is because you don't collect any data and so it'd be like hey

[63:17] what you know what do we need to grow what's our lead cost no idea what's our close right no idea

[63:21] what's our what's our what's our turn no idea well you can't really do much if you have no idea what's

[63:25] going on and so this then becomes the Katrina the business which is we need to start collecting data

[63:30] now to be clear the first five have what i consider an impossible scenario there's some some cost

[63:36] the cost here is that you give up a business the cost here is that you have to cut you have to

[63:40] prune things you have to hire someone and hurt your own income here the issues that you have to say

[63:43] no to customers that you're currently making money from here the issue is that you have to say no

[63:48] to employees you're currently over compensating here you have to turn down customers at a lower price

[63:53] and have and hear no more often those are the short term cost but the one big risk of all

[63:57] is that is that your business is going to grow and you've been stuck for long enough to know it's

[64:00] already not happening and there's not going to be a silver bullet you got to confront this the no data

[64:04] data issue is just hey silly pants get your data then you'll actually be able to grow now there's no

[64:10] downside to this one the only downside here is that you've got some shiny object that you think is

[64:13] really really sexy and interesting and you don't get to do that because you need to do this so do this first

[64:19] and i'll give you a really useful razor for how to think about what data collect to collect all right

[64:26] so the easiest test for is this data valuable is when it changes that's a delta so if it goes

[64:33] up or it goes down does it change that's another delta behavior so if we track our views on a social

[64:42] media channel if the views go up does it change what we do if the views go down does it change what we do

[64:47] if the answer is no then we don't need to track it because you can track unlimited variables in the

[64:52] world like you can track the temperature of the room when when when people are walking it you could track it

[64:56] but we'll change your behavior you can also reverse engineering to what are the behaviors we do

[65:01] what data affects it and there's the only pieces of data that need to track so my biggest personal

[65:06] growth lesson of the year so I give you all the portfolio growth things but my number one was

[65:13] rush is imaginary now I just give you that whole speech on urgency but one of the things that is

[65:22] that I've had to learn is my biggest mistakes have been Johnny object or woman in the red dress

[65:27] and over extension and so I have these arbitrary goals that I set for myself that I never

[65:32] say out loud that I think about every day that mean nothing to know one and then I try and force

[65:37] everything to happen on this arbitrary timeline that I made up and then I'm upset when people who don't

[65:42] know my arbitrary timeline fall short of the speed that I want to happen even though I made it up to

[65:48] begin with and so Laila gave me this frame that I alluded to briefly earlier but it's probably been

[65:55] as a talent focus and this is a subset of focus but it's missed opportunities is less than

[66:05] problems so what I mean by that is that the opportunities that you're looking for are in the

[66:11] problems that you need to solve and me understanding this I've repeated it because it's really

[66:16] been cinched into my brain there are for example if you're starting to get low reviews these are

[66:21] things that threaten the lively and the business that is a problem if you're not doing email follow up

[66:25] that isn't missed opportunity and unless you were call it payback rate or your LTV or some

[66:31] sort of conversion mechanisms is is the risk of the business then that would be a missed opportunity

[66:35] if the if the no more risk in the business right now is like you can't make money because you

[66:39] are converting a higher percentage of leads then that would shift into a problem it's not that like

[66:43] any specific thing is one or the other it's recognizing contextually within your business is this

[66:49] something that would be nice to do or is this something that we must do in order for us to achieve

[66:56] our ultimate goal we might be able to achieve our ultimate goal without doing email follow up if our

[67:00] product sucks we will never achieve our ultimate goal and so it's understanding the order of magnitude

[67:05] or the importance of the potential tasks that you have the reason that this stress me out for so long

[67:12] and this is the big one is that problems in your business are actually finite you can list all the

[67:16] number of problems in your business by and large missed opportunities are infinite I would look at the

[67:22] world of all the things that we could do and here's the thing is the better you get at business

[67:25] the more things you know you should be doing that's your and you see this huge unlimited potential

[67:30] options of things and you look at these tiny little resources that you have and then it's like we

[67:34] need to do all of these things and this is where you stress out your team and you stress out yourself

[67:39] for literally no reason it's been difficult for me and it's been a discipline now to ask myself

[67:45] first when I want something to happen is this a missed opportunity or is this a problem and

[67:50] nine times at a ten it's a missed opportunity and so I've been doubling down on problems and

[67:55] solving those the thing is is that problems are typically not nearly as fun as missed opportunities

[67:59] because missed opportunities have all the new gloss on them there's they're they're still in the

[68:03] wrapping paper like oh my god this can be amazing but as soon as you get into it you're like oh there's

[68:07] problems here too and then and I've said this before but what ends up happening is when you have

[68:12] this missed opportunity bug you you start building all of these half built bridges right you never

[68:18] actually get all the way across you've got a dollar here but you're standing on this side of the

[68:21] land right and you need to get this dollar across and you start building and then you find out that

[68:26] there's problems and then you're like oh no so you know what I'm gonna build a second bridge and

[68:30] then you find out that there's problems and you're like oh no I hate problems I'm gonna go find

[68:35] another one that doesn't have problems and immediately just makes me more money but there's always

[68:38] problems there's always problems and so it's like I have to just use the problems and I've got

[68:42] to stitch this thing together so that I can get the dollar all the way across and then into my

[68:47] very large pocket and so here's the difficult part of this for an entrepreneur is that when you

[68:52] whatever when you quit your job when you started this business you were very reinforced for pursuing

[68:56] a missed opportunity you weren't doing this thing you start this business and you get rewarded for doing

[69:01] it and the problem is is that you need to unlearn that behavior because it's a behavior that you

[69:06] only want to do once when you start your business and then every time after that you have to confront

[69:10] you have to endure you have to stick through the problem and see it to its natural end you have to

[69:15] get it all the way there so the dollars can make it across the bridge or you'll just have spent

[69:21] all the resources all the distraction to build and reinforce this thing that actually results in

[69:26] nothing and so this has been probably my my single biggest tier of lesson because this is a subset

[69:33] of focus for me specifically but I ask is this a missed opportunity or is this a problem and if

[69:40] it's a problem then I need to solve it and I just need to confront and a lot of the problems

[69:44] are things that you don't know how to solve yet that's why they're still unsolved and so you have to

[69:47] become comfortable in enduring the failure of working with limited information or incomplete information

[69:55] because the reality of businesses is that you will almost always not have enough information

[70:00] to know perfectly whether this is the right call and so you have to be comfortable in ambiguity

[70:06] you have to be comfortable with incomplete data sets and still making the call because when you have

[70:11] a complete data set there's really no stress they answer obvious because you have the data it's

[70:15] all the times you're like oh well I wish I had tracked that one thing that I didn't know is going to

[70:19] be important now and I can't go back six months to get it that happens all the time and you just

[70:23] got to be able to make the call because the thing is is that we have this fear that we're leaving

[70:28] money on the table right we feel like this missed opportunity right here or like man there's so much

[70:33] money on the table but the real money on the table sits in the problems that you know you should be

[70:41] solving but aren't and so once I realize that the problems are the things that need to be solving

[70:47] then I can deploy all of the resources that I normally would use to distract myself to reinforce

[70:52] this bridge and reinforce this bridge and reinforce this bridge before I've made a dollar go across

[70:57] and then point all of those resources to one this big dollar sign so I can go put it into my pocket

[71:01] and actually solve it and so the compounding that occurs in business happens from focus it's from doing

[71:07] one or two things exceptionally well not doing many things mediocre and missed opportunities are the

[71:14] gateway drug to mediocrity and how I how I deal with this emotionally is I have a big list of

[71:21] Alex's big money ideas and I've done this at very different times of my life like when I know

[71:26] what we need to do and we just have to keep doing more of it and the thing is it's like you probably

[71:30] know this too and yet you have this this this need for novelty right I get it believe me and so what I do

[71:38] is I add this idea to my big money list and then when we do have been with I say what one big

[71:45] thing on this big money list are we gonna attack what's crazy is I'm like I've got a hundred ideas

[71:50] and then it's a fun part of it like okay which of these things is the biggest thing that will

[71:55] get us the furthest and what's craziest and if you actually do this I have found so many times

[72:00] that I'm in love with an idea and then a month later two months later I look at that idea on the

[72:04] list and I'm like I can't even believe I was so into that right and so thing is is that if you don't

[72:08] have that display don't just write on it you don't let it marinate for a little bit sometimes you

[72:13] end up deploying all these resources and something that you will mother to later be like I don't even

[72:17] if this is resonating with you right now then do more of this put more of the ideas on a

[72:23] big idea list and then just let it cook and don't tell anybody because you have this need to share

[72:27] you this need to talk the idea out I get it I do it just right out as much as you need to there and

[72:33] then it's like you get you get it out of your head so you didn't have to you got all the details

[72:36] on all the craziness out and you're like I can shove it I'll do it later it's kind of like Abraham

[72:40] Lincoln used to write these letters when he was really angry at people you'd write these huge letters just

[72:44] scathing letters these people and then he would seal him and then he put him in his desk and he said he'd

[72:48] sleep on and the next day if he wanted to send it he could and so his desk after years was just filled

[72:54] with all these letters that he never sent but it allowed him to get through the moment so I want to hit

[72:59] on this rush piece because I think this is important all right so I'm gonna put these over here

[73:03] to the side for a moment and rush is imaginary so something that I've been thinking about is like where does

[73:09] rush come from so fundamentally if unless you have a network effect business so you have a winter take

[73:15] all market like you're trying to become the Uber of whatever right there's a network fact that

[73:21] one there's one winter who will win and that's it like if you're you're either gonna be apple

[73:24] or you're gonna be android there's no one else in the market like you've got two spots in the market

[73:28] for phone creators and that's it that's the monopoly right unless you're in one of those settings which

[73:32] 99% of businesses are not in that situation I have realized that for me rush is actually linked to

[73:38] one thing which is my competition reference point which is fundamentally who I choose to compare

[73:44] myself to and so my rush is entirely arbitrary because I just pick who I'm comparing myself to now here's

[73:50] what's kind of crazy do you compare yourself to a five year old do you look at a five or

[73:53] me like what a loser they don't have a business as big as me now of course not right but the

[73:59] thing is is that why wouldn't you compare yourself to a five year old well because they haven't had any

[74:04] time and because they are not developed yet but the thing is is that they're another human just like

[74:10] you and they will eventually because now like let's fast for 20 years now they're 25 and let's say

[74:15] they're crushing it do you now compare yourself to them why do you compare themselves at 25 and not at

[74:20] five no real reason because we think it's acceptable to compete against that particular person and so

[74:26] for me the realization that rush is entirely linked to I choose to compare myself to meant that

[74:32] it's entirely made up of my mind so I can just change what I compare myself to or I could try to

[74:36] compare myself less much more difficult and so in thinking about this it's more how does this comparison

[74:42] change what I do every day and if it changes my actions that decreases the likelihood that I

[74:48] achieve my long term goals then these comparisons hurt me and so the question that follows from

[74:53] the comparisons is how does this serve me and if it doesn't then why do it like do you feel guilty

[74:59] in middle school that you are the richest person in the world well then why do you feel guilty at 30

[75:03] I'm not saying that's my my goal life it's not but like fundamentally you don't like you don't

[75:08] like flipping roles when you're in middle school I do you feel like a loser because you're not

[75:11] making money maybe a couple people right but y'all are weird right but most people when middle school you're like

[75:16] oh my god I have you know I'm getting chest hair whatever that right you're like I'm navigating life right

[75:21] now like I'm a child looking my limbs they're longer right and so the thing is is that we just choose

[75:28] to enter this comparison game but we're all gonna die and all of our stuff's gonna go right back

[75:33] into the middle and other people are gonna play with our chips so cares and if this rush is impacting

[75:39] your business then you need to find a way to quell it which is either stop comparing change your

[75:45] comparison to now a third door is to compare yourself to your heroes at that stage in their lives

[75:50] right which is where was Warren Buffett at age 35 okay am I on track with him but again you're not

[75:56] gonna be Warren Buffett because Warren Buffett lived through the greatest growth in American history

[76:01] and was borough board at the perfect time right and he also bought us first stock when you said did you buy

[76:04] your first stock when you were seven no here goes there goes my five-year-old analogy so if you didn't buy

[76:09] first stock with your seven you're not Warren Buffett now you can model his behavior to have outcomes

[76:13] that will be probably proportionally smaller than his but that's okay it's only a problem if you think

[76:18] it's a problem so the next big category of kind of growth trends are focused to three to the year

[76:23] of twenty twenty five my big lessons was branding so I talk about branding a lot and that's

[76:27] because it's really important but I had a one day where I spent with Ben Francis so he came out

[76:33] to Vegas for the Olympia and we spent the day together came a day early which is great and we just

[76:36] hung out and Noel Mac who's his head of a brand was there with him and we got to spend a wonderful

[76:43] time talking about Brandon General and they told me the story that has really stuck with me I got to

[76:49] actually connect through them with the CMO of new balance and so this is the story new balance

[76:53] to CMO their growth head plateaued after a number of years and said they were kind of stagnant

[76:58] and they needed to shake things up so he became the CMO of everything and he went to the

[77:02] CMO and said hey can I just swing really big and the CMO said short and so then he said

[77:08] I want to take our spend which right now is seventy percent bottom of funnel and thirty percent

[77:16] top of funnel and I want to flip these two things I want to make thirty percent bottom and

[77:21] seventy percent top and you're like what does that mean this is brand awareness storytelling associations

[77:29] that you make with different athletes that is all top of funnel like wow new balance is cool right

[77:38] the bottom of funnel stuff is buy shoes right and so after doing this what was crazy is that

[77:46] for the first 18 months they made last money and so the companies return on their advertising

[77:52] budget went down for 18 months but on month 19 it went like this. Boop it started going up

[78:02] and then it went up even more and then it went up even more and so they've had this massive rebirth

[78:07] from this shift and strategy and so when I heard that story it was really compelling for no more

[78:13] reasons for me and it changed my behavior so number one was this is a good ratio to think about

[78:18] in terms of investing in an audience versus kind of withdrawing from the audience and the reason

[78:23] the seventy thirty I found interesting is that in the hundred million dollar leads book I talk

[78:27] about this at length but there's been a there's been a three to one ratio that's been studied by

[78:34] television's best buddy by radio which is content right to ads so if you're on your Facebook

[78:42] newsfeed and you scroll every three posts the fourth post will be an ad all right if you're on

[78:48] YouTube it might be number of minutes now they have AI and all this stuff but for the the typical

[78:52] one it's a three to one ratio now this ratio is what is required to basically keep a brand to keep a

[78:58] channel people keep coming back now if they change this to two to one all of a sudden people stop

[79:02] watching that channel they stop watch they switch to something else right and so that ratio being

[79:07] reflected here I see as a human thing and so I think to myself okay I need to make sure that I always

[79:13] keep my ratio at least three to one in terms of value driven and you can think about this in terms of

[79:19] views like impressions per person because that's what really matter we can think about this in dollar

[79:24] spend if you want to think about from a budgeting perspective but for me I think about this at the individual

[79:29] level I want to make sure that someone's getting at least three or four positives from any kind before

[79:34] they have any kind of ask for me to do something now the net net world is that if your product is

[79:40] exceptional the ask is not an ask because they're excited to buy something else from you and so this is

[79:47] why brand and product long term are inner woven together your reputation with somebody will be

[79:55] reinforced or diminished by the quality of the product because you make a promise with your

[79:59] advertisement and you deliver on that promise or over deliver on that promise with the product and if

[80:04] it's worse now you got to put more in the bucket here to kind of like get them to be willing to

[80:09] take another shot with you again or if you have a really good product the amount they have to put

[80:14] back in here is actually less you could sell something else even faster so if Apple came out with

[80:20] the next iPod right people be really excited about it and if the next day they said hey we also have

[80:26] this other amazing thing that doesn't necessarily compete with the iPod as long as you had the

[80:31] money which is a different question as long as you had the money or financing available you'd be

[80:35] excited to buy the next thing to provided the first thing was awesome and so this is the idea

[80:39] is that products can reinforce brand and should be the thing that reinforce brand over long term which is why

[80:44] I want everybody to read my books first because the books have been the pieces of content that I put

[80:49] more single time in than anything else I put 2,000 plus hours in each of those books like no joke

[80:55] 2,000 plus hours and so they are the single best pieces of content that I will likely ever make and they

[81:00] will outlive me these videos will go away like podcast when it's appear but the books were made

[81:06] that is why I want everyone to read them which is why I've made them free like you can listen to

[81:09] the moment podcast for free and if you like hard versions you go on my side or you go on Amazon

[81:14] you can grab them right they have you know 26,000 five stars there's a million copies that have

[81:18] been sold and it's because they're good right and it's because I put so much time in them and so

[81:23] this lesson first off was important for me because the ratio and it corroborated what I kind of

[81:29] think about in terms of content and giving to asking the other piece that I thought was really

[81:32] interesting was the time to like which is that he made this shift and then he had to wait a year

[81:37] and a half and that's given the size budget new balance has which means that if you want to build a

[81:41] brand you've got to expect you got to measure in years you're not going to build a brand in

[81:44] months it's just not going to happen people see my brand now but like my first YouTube videos also

[81:49] started in zero my first Facebook page started in zero like everyone not my first Instagram started

[81:53] like it's you're like everybody else and so it just takes time like my first YouTube video is

[81:57] I think it's 2019 right and so like don't expect to have a 10 year outcome in 12 months

[82:01] one of the questions that I asked myself is like okay for branding for CPG company so for

[82:07] companies that sell to consumers direct to consumer the branding playbook is very well tested right

[82:13] you go find influencers in that world or brands that are similar you do collaborations with them

[82:19] you basically cross over on values their values become somebody yours you kind of rub off on

[82:23] one another you go find champions and athletes that are top of their field you make the associations

[82:28] people then want to buy your product because of that associated in the history of positive

[82:32] reinforcement they had with that particular athlete okay now I was like how do I do this in a B2B

[82:37] setting right and so I have split this up into basically two major categories if I want to build a brand

[82:44] in a B2B setting right you typically want to educate your audience because you want to be

[82:48] positioned as a authority so if you're an accountant you're a lawyer whatever it is you want to be

[82:52] known as somebody who knows what they're doing right and so category one is you help them accomplish

[82:59] their goals for free very simple so a lot of this is going to be content right like this is why

[83:05] we bring with content is that if you like what's the most positive association someone can have they have

[83:10] a goal you have them achieve it okay so they will link their goal achievement to your help great the next

[83:16] thing is that you help someone like them so it's an approximation which is okay I am a lawyer

[83:22] and I help someone negotiate some deal and that person and I and I have to advertise it I

[83:27] feel like people know about it but me seeing that as a plumber and this lawyer only helps

[83:32] plumber and negotiate these deals I say oh someone just like me got exactly what I want so this is a

[83:36] degree removed the next one is that you do the aspirational outcome yourself now both of these can

[83:42] be aspirational to be clear and this was actually something that Ben and I talked about a lot Ben

[83:48] which was oftentimes brands are built on the aspirational because it's almost like an extreme

[83:54] version that I translate into decreasing risk of purchase so let me explain so north face can help people

[84:02] get to Everest and so if it's really cold at the top of Everest if I buy that jacket it will likely

[84:07] keep me warm on the way to work from my car to the door if Range Rover makes an ultimate outdoor

[84:14] vehicle and that they're the ultimate off-roader then it'll probably help me if I have to get over a curve

[84:21] right it's these extreme versions that get regressed down to well if it can do that then it'll

[84:25] probably help me with my thing right C-bomb is the best fitness influencer right now in this generation

[84:32] and so if he wears this stuff to compete at the Olympia and train for the Olympia then for me

[84:38] it just is trying to be the strongest guy at my gym it'll probably work for me and so the question is what

[84:43] is that aspirational outcome like Red Bull if I could go I can drink the Red Bull and jump out of space

[84:48] then it'll probably get me a little bit motivated when I have five hours of sleep right like

[84:52] you notice the thing we were like all of these brands had these big aspirational outcomes there's

[84:57] a reason that my brand grew when I had a $46 million exit because it was an aspirational outcome

[85:03] now what I'm trying to do now and I've been public about that is cross-ability dollars like that's

[85:06] the goal and when that occurs my brand will be reinforced it'll be strengthened because it'll be

[85:11] an aspirational goal for more people now the good news is a $50 million exit or $46

[85:15] million exit is a good enough occurrence for many people now a different aspirational thing might be

[85:22] our portfolio performance now where we're significantly more than when we had that exit but

[85:26] it's less validated it's less third party signed off and when we have that sign off it'll be

[85:31] come validated now I'll give you fun story of this the amount of people that gave me kudos

[85:36] for selling gymlaunch was significantly more than the people who gave me kudos for owning gymlaunch

[85:42] but the owning of gymlaunch I was richer the day before I sold the company than the day after

[85:47] because the equity in the business compound attacks free and the moment I sold it I had to pay taxes

[85:54] on what I gained and so by definition I had less money after the transaction then before but

[85:59] everyone perceived it because there was a third party edification that occurred because the third

[86:03] party ed arms length made the transaction happen and so it was real but as long as you don't live

[86:07] in the minds of other people's perceptions which to be fair in branding you kind of do you don't want

[86:11] your self worth to be tied in their perception but your brand ultimately will be and so the idea is

[86:17] the question to answer if you were a B to B business and you're trying to which is over half of

[86:21] businesses or B to B funds dad I didn't know I was looking this up for for school actually is that

[86:25] these are basically your buckets is how do I help them do what they want how do I help people like them

[86:31] and how can I accomplish something aspirational in their mind or help other people like them

[86:35] accomplish that aspirational thing and this is where like you can help them accomplish their goals

[86:39] or the aspirational goal it's either of those things but the aspirational when I find incredibly

[86:43] interesting because some people saw the book launch last year for the hundred-dollar leads we had

[86:48] gazillion people there alive it was awesome and they were like I would like to do something like that

[86:53] and so that in and of itself was a brand reinforcing event and so big picture this is what I see as

[86:59] the process for building a B to B brand because it's not like you're going to like think about

[87:05] like this if you're a if you're an attorney you're not going to sign the top attorney you know OJ Simpson's

[87:09] attorney I can it's the Kardashians ax I can't remember gender anyways now that's Bruce Jenner

[87:14] forget about it you get the idea is that like if you were a business person then it's like Elon's

[87:19] not going to endorse you right it's not going to happen and so it's like you have to do the other

[87:23] things that can approximate your proficiency with proof and so the final to you TLDR of this is

[87:30] you have resources this is what your brand must accomplish this is the timeline that it has to go

[87:35] off of this is the ratio you need to follow and this is how you spend your money in time

[87:41] to make these things happen for the audience and that's how you do it and so this has been my focus

[87:48] one of the big kind of like crystallizations of knowledge maybe deepened my understanding of

[87:52] branding and how translates back and forth between D to C and B to B. Sharon's Rossa good friend of

[87:57] Leilanoan currently the CEO of real also has swirlocapodow which is his investment firm.

[88:03] He gave me this little quip that I really like and he said talent only gets better in the future

[88:10] and that has been I mean you'll notice a common theme around people in this and that's because

[88:14] when I look at the things that we did really well with this year is bring good people in get bad

[88:18] people out and the companies that did the best more folio like that strategy ring for like the the

[88:23] the highest performing company the portfolio we put in probably like six great leaders and it's just

[88:28] crushing and that that's not an accident right so that's thing number one in terms of talent

[88:34] the second thing is work with the people who move towards you and so I have spent too much time in

[88:42] my life trying to sell people on why they should do things my way or with my values or with my

[88:49] kind of rules which I did to find culture as rules of reinforcement in a business so like

[88:54] these are the rules of the game is I would like to play it and I noticed that if I kind of had this

[89:00] kind of recurring conflict with a handful of people I was like I don't need to do this like

[89:06] there's another person who is stoked to be here will agree with the path and it will be

[89:12] so much more efficient because they'll want to talk to me I want to talk to them we agreed to

[89:16] the rules of the game the way we both want to play it and so we'll just play that much better

[89:20] that much longer and so this is more of like a warning shop because I think what happens is you

[89:25] habituate especially if you're an entrepreneur you have a high pain tolerance like you're used to

[89:29] you're used to suffrake suffrake is just the current state and so sometimes someone comes in

[89:33] things are okay sometimes they change sometimes you change whatever but fundamentally conflict

[89:39] emerges and if you cannot resolve the conflict then over time your communication cycle lessons

[89:44] and lessons you start talking less and less frequently and if this person is close to you or close

[89:49] to your function it becomes very difficult to basically for them to do their job and for you to get

[89:54] what you need out of the role and so my my single line of advice is work with the people move

[90:00] towards you and so a corollary second point of that that's a different frame to think through is

[90:05] if your team doesn't admire some aspects of you you either have to change them or you have to change

[90:10] you like this is a tough one though because you want like this is my opinion if your team doesn't

[90:17] admire certain things about you then the likely that you have strong influence of their behavior

[90:21] outside of basically punishment is low and it's much better in my opinion to have a team who

[90:26] admire different traits of yours now they don't have to say everything you do is amazing

[90:30] but like there are their skills you have there are behavior you do that they're like man to be

[90:35] really cool if I had that or it's really cool that he has that or she has that and that creates

[90:39] this element of respect in the relationship that I think is really required for high performance

[90:45] and you have two choices there like either you change or they change or you get someone else

[90:50] so you change the whole thing right I think making sure that you've established the rules of the

[90:54] game and just subtly noticing like is there someone who just like disrespects you on a regular basis

[90:59] or they try to the first one to disagree I want to be clear I'm not saying that you shouldn't

[91:04] have healthy tension and disagreement at the top it's actually very common like everybody who has

[91:09] like different perspectives to yield the best outcome like that's how you get truth so that's that's

[91:13] good but if you're consistently blocked on what you considered to be like par for course behaviors

[91:20] that can great on you and I think that I tolerated that for too long and I have done that for

[91:25] in different occasions and I want to shorten the time that I tolerate those kind of dynamics

[91:31] so next up is sawdust my favorite businesses in the world are businesses that are started off

[91:38] of waste from someone else so let me explain so I love the Airbnb and I love Uber the way that

[91:45] like people have access capacity or sawdust they have something that they're not using that would

[91:50] be valuable for someone else an easy example in a brick and mortar scenario it's like I don't

[91:54] use my gym I gym was closed after 830 and it was no one used it until 430 in the morning

[92:00] and so I'm paying for this rent and I have this space and there's probably some people who would like

[92:05] to have that space but can't right and I didn't have you know weekend hours ended after noon right

[92:11] and so there are many of us and Airbnb did this on the residential side obviously like you have

[92:16] a spare bedroom you can let someone crash there and you can make money for it but the thing is that

[92:19] within businesses you also have access capacity you have sawdust and so the sawdust analogy comes

[92:26] from lumber mills when they would they'd strip the trees of bark they would turn them into planks

[92:31] and then you know they shipped the planks out but a smart format of the factory looked on the

[92:35] ground one day and they had to just keep sweeping up all this dust from the saw and then finally

[92:40] one guy said hey could we just mix this with glue and make plywood and then if all of a sudden

[92:45] a whole new kind of industry was born from there where you could take the scraps and then turn

[92:50] into something else and in the fur business that I did when I was 16, 17, 18 and there the owner

[92:57] would have to make these jackets and he would cut off these snippets from the snippets he was

[93:01] able to make earmuffs and then he was able to sell this earmuffs or give the earmuffs away as

[93:06] bonuses and so he was able to make something from nothing and so there are sawdust things that

[93:12] exist in your business and I'll tell you one of the big ones that came from acquisition.com so our

[93:16] primary business is obviously the portfolio and that's where the majority of our resources are

[93:20] allocated towards and we tried to figure out a way where we could meet more potential portfolio

[93:26] companies so I try to few different things to come out well the barrier was too low we got

[93:31] mixedy matchy and I was like that's not good so we tried that one we didn't meet good people and

[93:35] I was like all right that's not good so the next thing I was like okay what if we raised the

[93:38] qualifications really high and then we like kind of have these dinners so we did we did like

[93:43] four or five dinners where people would fly out we'd meet them the whole idea for me was like I

[93:47] have to eat either ways I might as well eat with people like again like sawdust like what do I have

[93:51] to I also have to make content so if I go to dinner I make content and I meet people this is all good

[93:55] this helps us generate deals and the reason that I was trying to figure this out was because the best

[93:59] before like we're like companies we have our number one number two number four best before we company

[94:02] we're companies that we had worked with for six or twelve months prior so we had an existing

[94:05] relationship we had helped them grow and then we were like okay I think they're profiler

[94:09] ready now that we've been our investment and we grew them from there and our best performers were

[94:12] like that so I was like how can I how can I how can I have this happen on purpose rather than by accident

[94:16] so I was I was really struggling with this mind you I was also like running the profiler too

[94:19] so it's like I wasn't putting full attention towards it and then in January I was like okay well

[94:23] we have this building and we have there's an open open floor space there were all bunch of desks

[94:28] there but I was like we're we're using those desks everybody had offices and because we do a lot of

[94:32] like confidential calls and we're not at we're more of an office closed door setup and so we

[94:36] cleared the desks and we're like okay well let's see if some businesses would want to fly out

[94:41] to our headquarters and have a spend like two days kind of going over how we create value

[94:47] because in that way it's like it will provide value to them and that people were like oh this is

[94:50] really cool I would love to potentially like follow up with them over the long haul they become

[94:54] they kind of enter a longer term nurture process and we can potentially do deals with those people

[94:58] it's better that's also why we spun of basic adventures etc and so that whole division of

[95:03] workshops came out of we have extra space and the portfolio team is it fully allocated like they

[95:10] work on the portfolio obviously but like they can step down for a day or two during the month to meet

[95:15] other companies network with them share how they are turning around different companies in our

[95:20] portfolio specific divisions or departments and that'll be very additive like we can add value to

[95:24] everyone and add speed and I get content from it and so that was a big W and the reason I bring

[95:31] this up is there are some things in your business that check more than one box and so it's like I

[95:36] don't want a single box check I want like four boxes checked and so this generates deal flow

[95:43] this generates cash flow this generates content this generates talent flow and so all of these things

[95:53] and utilizes a resource that I already have paid I already I have to pay I pay this building every

[95:57] month right like this cost exists I pay my team every month no matter what either way and so it used

[96:02] an existing cost basis to create a new opportunity for content and deal flow and so from that it's like

[96:09] if you can just look at the pieces you have on the board this is actually what I do is I try and

[96:13] write down with as much detail what are all the things we do on a regular basis like what are the

[96:17] calls we take what are the conferences we attend what are the like every single thing we do and I'm

[96:21] like is there a way I can recombine these things into something that would be valuable at no cost to me

[96:26] and that's where I've had these really disproportionate gains in profitable divisions or products

[96:32] in our community obviously and then within the portfolio so for example you probably have

[96:36] SOPs in checklist within your business right of how you do whatever you do well if you can take that

[96:41] and then turn those into lead magnets then not only are they valuable for you they also generate demand

[96:47] and so that's just a very micro example of like take something you're already doing and find another

[96:51] use for that requires no extra work the next one's really big and so this is a little bit looking

[96:56] forward into 2025 and beyond and so I believe this so this is a bet so that I'd be clear this is

[97:03] uh this is me making a bet and calling a shot so I believe that I are well into AI existing polar

[97:10] opposite size of a continuum and I think that doubling down on both of these is a good decision

[97:18] and so within our portfolio we are pushing heavily on both sides and so post-COVID I still feel like

[97:26] there's unmet demand for people who want to connect I mean obviously this is why invested in school

[97:30] like I believe community is really good and I think it's lacking right now something is huge to

[97:34] demand for it and we've never we've never been more connected and also feel so apart and so it's

[97:40] it's almost like we have a lot of false solutions it's like we're eating fake food that keeps you

[97:44] full but doesn't satisfy you it's kind of like porn to sex like it's not the real thing right and so

[97:49] the idea is like this is the real thing this is efficiency and so it's like how can I how can I

[97:56] get as much efficiency as possible so that I can do as many of the unscalable things that are the

[98:01] real thing and this IRL push that I'm doing I'm doing across all the portfolio companies because

[98:08] the interesting thing about IRL is customers who have in-person experiences have tremendously different

[98:14] brand affinity they're more loyal they refer more they rate higher they buy more often and if you have

[98:19] a strong culture within your marketing your branding you will attract like-minded people and so that

[98:26] allows you to provide them value at no extra cost so it's thing about like this if I assemble a

[98:33] party I'm the host of the party everybody who meets at the party feels like the the party was awesome

[98:38] if everyone else at the party was great I could not talk to any of the guests and have them think

[98:42] Alex's party was awesome and I will get a disproportionate amount of the reward from the associations and

[98:47] the time they had but that network allows people who assemble to provide value to each other which is

[98:53] almost like so like you're not you you just organize and you let them provide the value and so IRL

[99:00] and AI I'm heavily pushing on this this year Sam Altman said that this year is the year

[99:04] AGI will come out 2025 so artificial general intelligence is basically AI is better than everyone

[99:10] and everything which is frightening but we'll figure it out in the meantime though it'd be great if

[99:13] it could take some sales calls and set some appointments pretty accurate so and maybe help with some

[99:19] content and things like that but in the meantime we're staying really oppressed on this and we're

[99:23] actively kind of like I'm not trying to be the AI company I want to be a company that uses AI well

[99:30] just to be clear about my position on this IRL though is something that I feel like AI will not

[99:35] disrupt and I think that the demand for in-person experiences will continue to rise and I think that

[99:40] it is a good bet to make and so this is what I'm betting on next year and I will mention this because

[99:46] a lot of people don't like IRL because they say it's unscalable right but I care so much more about

[99:52] is it valuable and if it's valuable enough it's worth scaling and so the thing is is that just

[99:58] because it's harder doesn't mean it's not worth doing and the benefit of scaling something that

[100:03] is harder to scale but also valuable means that once you scale a little bit more you'll have more

[100:07] resources to continue salient and so if we can build cities in the middle of the desert or the

[100:12] middle of the ocean we can absolutely scale an in-person experience. Next fun one is school so

[100:19] it's crazy about this is that this was this year which feels like you know an eternity ago but we

[100:24] we negotiated the deal in 2023 and then in January we came up publicly with it so this was the first

[100:30] brand deal that I did this year or I started the first brand that I've ever done and the main reason

[100:34] behind doing it was that I believe in the product and I believe in the team and I thought it was the

[100:40] best one and I think it's going to win and so that is why I was willing to make that bet and to be

[100:44] very clear opportunity always looks like risk today and this this bet has proven out very well the

[100:52] platform continues to grow like crazy we have millions and millions of users which is awesome and

[100:56] that was kind of the goal and the reason that I ended up betting on this first is like any other

[101:00] potential thing I could do was it felt very uniquely fit for me so I explained what I mean so

[101:08] there's a make money component to school there's a education component to school there's a

[101:15] community component to school which I just see is like plus for for social right and then all of these

[101:21] together aren't an opportunity vehicle that is high leverage and so for those reasons I was like

[101:27] I feel like I am uniquely qualified for education media would be another one here there's definitely a

[101:33] huge media component with the business so it's like education media business societal good

[101:39] operational leverage this was it was like if you could make a business that hit a lot of the things

[101:44] that I'm about and for me it also helped people who are going zero to one and I have a huge percentage

[101:51] of the audience that want to start a business don't have one and didn't know where to go and so I wanted

[101:57] to have something that I could say if you aren't a business owner yet this is a very easy business

[102:02] to get started it's very low risk there's not many moving parts you can do without any employees you

[102:07] don't have to have inventory you literally just need to learn the basic skills and so this is a

[102:12] great vehicle for doing it and so I was super pumped when we found out that the average community

[102:18] made 1,360-log per month that's paid communities and I think that's really cool because it's like

[102:24] no this isn't you're not going to be a gazillion here by doing this but it can help get you started and that

[102:29] I see this is a great gateway for getting a notch partnership as a side note for existing

[102:34] businesses I think every existing business should have like every gym owner should have a school

[102:38] community every every realtor should have a community for their for their customers every

[102:42] HOA should have a community a school community for for there for the people in the neighborhood like

[102:48] whatever business you have like if you have any commerce business there's a ton of

[102:51] you commerce business is joining school right now that realize that the email deliverability like if you

[102:56] can reach 100% of people who bought your product the feedback that you can get on the product

[103:00] the reviews the likely they buy the next thing goes way up and so it's like sure add them to email

[103:05] us but also add them to a live community and so I see that is again the IRL versus AI like

[103:10] how do we how do we bring people together and so we're also doubling down on that with school

[103:14] because we are not we don't see ourselves I mean obviously it's a technology business but like

[103:18] it's a community business and so we're also doubling down on how can we facilitate in person

[103:23] connections between people of similar interests so I'll I'll give you some specific lessons that

[103:30] I've learned from growing school tremendously over the last year so number one is a zero

[103:38] usually decreases hold on usually your split test will fail and so basically the more

[103:44] optimize something is the more likely a change from optimal results in a decrease and so our first

[103:50] launch of the school games page did so well that we've done like 14 sorry 16 major split tests

[103:55] and only two of them have won and so like anything from the control is really really dialed and

[104:01] it's typically like if you have monstrous amounts of traffic when you incur the cost of change like

[104:06] it is it is a real cost the second kind of thing that I that I would say that like I've learned

[104:10] or rather been reinforced from school is kind of customers above everything which is just always

[104:16] a great reminder Paul Graham has this statement that I probably feel like I've said a whole

[104:19] bunch of times this year which is you can solve almost every problem in a business by talking to

[104:23] your customers more like if your marketing isn't working talk to your customers if your sales isn't

[104:27] working talk to your customers if your product isn't working talk to your customers right you you are

[104:30] never too big to not talk to your customers and so that that was a big emphasis the I would say the

[104:36] next one is the the the value of offers it was just you know the school games itself was a really

[104:42] cool offer that we came up with and then we added in you can want to cyber chalk if you if you win

[104:48] which which made it even crazier and so the the uplift that a business can get from having a

[104:53] superior offer we got to see that you know it's just it's nice to see things proven out so that was

[104:58] a really good one the next big lesson I'll put this one this is really big is the value of

[105:02] deletion and simplicity so I'll explain what I'm in here so we have tried to make it as easy

[105:08] seemingly possible for people to win on the platform and we get better and better every day but a big

[105:13] part of it is is the number of recent people cancel things is overwhelmed and so overwhelmed

[105:17] translates into zero value because they stop so what happens is people hear it overwhelmed and then

[105:22] add more stuff and so it's it's rare that addition improves things rather than simply making things

[105:30] better or taking something out and making and replacing it with something better or limiting it all together

[105:34] like you want it to be as simple as possible but no simpler right like if you if you take away

[105:39] all the friction that occurs from using a phone what's left is an iPhone right the only next version

[105:46] of that would be you just talk in the air and then like you get connected with people like that

[105:50] would be the next version of that but what Steve Jobs did was an order of magnitude improvement

[105:53] off of the existing phones and he just looked at all the things that suck about a phone removed

[105:57] all of them and what was left was the iPhone and so thinking about product and value this way

[106:02] right so the value equation you've got the outcome you've got the risk right you've got speed

[106:08] and then you've got you've got you've got effort right so the idea is how do we make it faster

[106:16] and easier faster and easier faster and easier over and over and over again on this value

[106:21] equation and a lot of times what makes things faster and easier is removing things and so I have

[106:26] grown more and more affinity towards looking at what's there and saying okay we need to maximize value

[106:31] per second not seconds of value and so this comes from the media side in terms of making content

[106:37] but on the product side like every customer will ask you for different things and they will and if you

[106:43] give them every single thing they ask for they will cause their own demise and then leave and

[106:47] so then you get these frank and stined products that have a gazillion gismos that no one knows how

[106:51] to use because to fit it all in it's like there's a hundred specific use cases that don't apply

[106:55] to everyone and so product discipline around keeping simplicity and speed and ease as the primary

[107:03] goal is an incredibly difficult thing to focus on and making those strategic bets and so that

[107:08] has been a great focus and kind of re-learning I would say of this year with school and I would say

[107:15] finally having like knowing what your what your loop is all right so it's like what's your flywheel

[107:21] so Jim Collins has a short book on this called the flywheel I think or flywheel effect and

[107:26] it's basically like can you draw a circle within your business which is first we do this

[107:32] which then if we do this this is what must occur when this happens this next thing must occur

[107:36] if this occurs this next thing must occur right and so I'll show you what what I'm talking about

[107:42] so if we make a lot of media right for businesses so we make a lot of business medium if we do that

[107:49] then we will get business owners who are interested in our stuff right and if we get business

[107:55] interested business owners who are interested in our stuff right they will then do deals if we do deals

[108:01] with them we'll have stuff to make media about and so this is a basic wheel of acquisition.com

[108:08] we talk about business stuff that gets businesses interested we do deals with those businesses

[108:13] those businesses get outcomes which then we talk about in the media and so around and around we go

[108:17] we want a wheel that feeds itself and so the only thing that's required is to get the wheel moving

[108:22] and so within school we have multiple different loops that we have that generate the growth

[108:28] that compounds in the business and these loops are so important because when you have a linear

[108:32] input output equation in terms of how business grows then it means that you just have to keep adding

[108:36] more on the front end what you want is something that you spark once the engine runs and then

[108:41] all of a sudden it spins and it spins and goes out of control and it just keeps growing right and so

[108:46] that is the ultimate goal is having multiple of these fly wheels so a simple example is like Amazon

[108:51] they create a marketplace that has the cheapest products that have the highest fidelity in terms of

[108:57] the risk that someone has to make when they purchase because they have the reviews so if they do that

[109:01] then they will get more customers if they have more customers then they will be able to get

[109:05] more suppliers if they have more suppliers they will get more competition in selection for customers

[109:09] which then brings in more customers right and so around and around we go and so it's businesses

[109:14] often have multiple fly wheels like this that exist at self-free and force and the quality of that

[109:19] fly wheel you want to figure out is what are the what are the friction points that prevent this

[109:22] we have from spending and then smooth it out so it just runs so this is probably I would say

[109:28] number five in terms of the things that I've got away from school this year and schools probably

[109:33] one of the best investments I've ever made so this year and somewhat last year we got this great

[109:38] office right and part of the reason we did this is because I wanted to have a massive gym I'm being

[109:42] really honest with you like I wanted to have a really big gym which I have and I wanted to have a place

[109:45] that I could record that wasn't like out of my house right across it as much as it is great to have

[109:49] my team in and out of my personal space I prefer it in a studio and so that was the reason for

[109:55] building this to begin with then we started having a lot of teammates just started like spending

[109:59] more time here and they're like maybe I'll move here and so then we started to become more and

[110:03] more in person as a business and so I will remind anyone I started in person exclusively with gyms

[110:09] then we went to gym lunch which was entirely a remote business and we were entirely remote before

[110:13] it was cool like we were entirely remote when people were like you can't be a remote business it's

[110:17] not legit for real like we would struggle to get like some banking relationships sometimes because they're

[110:22] like we need to I remember there was some software that we needed there like we need to see a picture

[110:26] of your filing cabinet and I was like what year is it but it's like it was antiquated until

[110:31] COVID and then became the norm and so I want to talk about pros and cons of this because some of

[110:35] you guys are business owners and you're trying to make this decision and so number one I think

[110:39] is understanding which roles are remote and which roles are in person so for us because we know

[110:44] how to manage I think remote teaches you how to manage better than in person does because there's

[110:47] so many insularity small communications that occur in person that don't get documented remotely

[110:52] that still have a material impact on the business and so if you're only remote you have to be very

[110:56] structured with communication if you're in person you can get away with a lot less now four roles

[111:02] like fundamentally we say like why does this person need to be here we would only want people to be here

[111:06] who should be here if you know if finance doesn't really need to be in the office and so that allows

[111:12] sister recruit from a wider net so we can recruit from all over the United States rather than

[111:16] requiring people to move or only picking from call it Las Vegas right and so for us the pros have

[111:22] been training is much better in person culture is much stronger I think you have an eye to efficiency

[111:27] which to be very somewhat offset with the additional cost of the building I think that you're able

[111:31] to see people in deep work and correct meeting cases things like that like if you're walking around

[111:36] everyone's own meetings all days you're like who's working right and so this allows you to you get

[111:41] faster feedback loops which I think is important the cons of in person is harder track

[111:45] town because they have to move that's a big one it's probably the biggest one but it's easier to

[111:49] track other people that so for us what we did to accommodate this is we for some roles depending on

[111:54] the level of the role we will also include signing bonuses and things like that so if you are

[111:58] in that position including more incentive for them to move or move their families to your place of

[112:03] businesses is a is a good way to do it I also recommend having them come out for like 30 days instead of

[112:08] hotel just so that they don't like you know deep plant their whole family if for some reason it doesn't

[112:14] work out kind of the first month you'll know and so that's that's like a little in between that

[112:19] I think is worth doing that has worked well for us to be clear for me I think 30% of our portfolio

[112:24] is in person 70% of remote so I don't have I don't care at all about how someone chooses to have

[112:30] you know structure their employee teams I think is what ever way it is I just want there to be sound

[112:34] reasoning behind it and so for us obviously we have a lot of media and so having the entire media team here

[112:39] makes sense because I film here I'm here and so they should be here too whereas like I said finance it doesn't

[112:44] really make sense and so it's just making sure that like you're not being a stickler in either

[112:47] direction for the sake of it and instead just saying like what problem are we solving and which

[112:53] path increases the likelihood that it gets solved so this year I actually made a lot of personal

[112:58] improvements in terms of my environment and I'll share some of those with you right now and so

[113:04] as I was saying earlier you know I worked a lot more days this year a lot more hours per day than

[113:07] I probably worked in recent history and I needed to optimize more things because kind of like

[113:12] when a car is driving at 60 miles an hour it's like it moves a little bit when you're 200 miles an hour

[113:15] tiny movement makes a huge change it's kind of the same thing in terms of me and so with the

[113:19] increase in hours the increase in days I was like I need to get everything else dialed and so

[113:24] one massive one which is going to sound so silly is the big three of sleep so number one is pitch

[113:31] black and I say pitch black I mean pitch black so tape the little lights on all the electronics in

[113:37] the room get black out curtains I'm telling you just do it I took way too long to do it just do it

[113:43] just do it please do it number one number two is it's got to be cold like it has to be super cold

[113:48] and if you are in a different temperature then the person you sleep with then get one of those

[113:53] mattress pads that has the temperature control thing it will change your life and will certainly

[113:57] change your sleep which could very much change your life just do it like it's it's I think they're they're

[114:01] like two grand and you spend more time in bed than anywhere else like it's the well spring of

[114:06] youth it's everything like worth doing and the third one and this is the most recent one is that I

[114:11] actually added in earplugs so I now sleep with earplugs which you just the simple phone ones like

[114:18] nothing crazy and sleeping with earplugs had a four beats per minute drop to my resting heart rate

[114:28] at the bottom of my sleep and so I bring this up because like it had a material difference

[114:34] in basically how deeply I rest and my deep sleep is basically very chunky and front loaded rather

[114:43] than like intermittent throughout the evening so it's like basically as soon as I get to bed I have

[114:46] like deep sleep because I hear not it's like I'm in this black float take essentially this cold

[114:52] dark take where I can't see anything or hear anything and so you you'll know when it's dark enough

[114:57] if when you open your eyes and when you close your eyes it's the same that's where you want to be and so

[115:02] those are some those are some significant ones the next big one for me was making sure that my

[115:08] work environment was basically just as tailored and so I've usually been better about this but I

[115:13] always blackout my windows because I get distracted with good weather I just want to go outside and so

[115:17] I black all that stuff out I had two desks that I set up one for standing one for sitting because I

[115:22] realized that having a desk that moved I ended up just not moving it because I didn't want to like

[115:26] mess the wires up and look all the other stuff I just set up two desks and so that was a helpful

[115:30] the biggest pain relief thing that I did this year because I spent a lot of time on my desk

[115:35] is I got a kneeling chair which sounds ridiculous and they look goofy but if you sit in one

[115:43] position all day like I was getting really bad neck pain like it was very tough for me and so by

[115:49] switching the kneeling chair originally I thought I was going to do half my day and one chair half

[115:53] my day and the other chair but then I realized that when I was in the kneeling chair I actually have like

[115:57] six different sitting positions that I do in that chair and so by constantly varying my sitting

[116:03] position because as soon as I get a little bit of comfortable I just I just change it up I was able

[116:06] to basically decrease the resting stress on like my muscles being in this one frozen position for an

[116:12] extended period and that eliminated my shoulder pain like gone and so I like really really helped me

[116:21] out a lot and so I don't I don't know what you're doing but like it was probably like a hundred bucks

[116:25] and like such high ROI for me and then the last piece is actually around my fitness so because I was

[116:30] in this very heavy season I decreased my workouts to two a week which is pretty light for me but I just

[116:36] made those the absolute so I basically did Saturday's Sundays my two workout days and I just go

[116:41] really hard on those days and that's actually kind of a weird way it's been more fun for me than trying

[116:46] to do shorter more frequent workouts and so it's actually kind of brought some like more life back

[116:50] into my training even though I'm doing it less frequently I'm like looking forward to it and I

[116:55] realized that for me I love training on one condition that I'm not in a rush like I hate having to

[117:03] like do a workout in 45 minutes because I have a call like it takes all the fun out of it for me and

[117:08] so I do know what Saturday's the Sunday's because I can just wake up I will workout as long as

[117:13] I feel like and then I'll start working and that's been like really really good for me but part of this

[117:19] has also been my transition at 35 I told myself you know when I was 15 I get 35 I will I will transition

[117:26] along Jebby and so I have made that transition now and so I'm like probably the lightest I've been

[117:30] in a long time I'm like 203ish right now which is very light for me for context I want to have

[117:36] you as us 250 so I was very positive and it's all all stake and so now I'm I'm 203 and basically

[117:43] toawas live longer than great dates which is small dogs live longer and so I want to put it you

[117:49] know less less stress on my heart and so I'm so for those of you who are like Alex looks

[117:52] smaller that's true because I am I have lost weight I've lost about 10 or 15 pounds and so I'll

[117:57] probably stay around here maybe I'll get in the high one 90s but I'll probably I maintain here

[118:02] pretty easily and so that's my update on that part and I do think that it's okay to have seasons

[118:08] like I'm not saying I'm only gonna work out twice a week forever I'm saying I work out twice

[118:10] a week now like I worked out three times this week and so it's not like I have these rules it's just

[118:14] that I absolutely committed to Saturdays and Sundays and being a weekend warrior and that has worked

[118:18] well for me to not work basically give myself permission to do that so that I could keep working

[118:21] harder and the stuff that needed to get me forward so next one is culture so I define culture is the

[118:27] rules that govern reinforcement in a business and so that means like the rules of behavior what is

[118:31] what is good what is neutral what is bad and typically people have some sort of values that they

[118:36] create that are supposed to embody that culture those values typically are you know either phrases

[118:42] or they're one or two words and you have you know three to ten of them right and so for us I've

[118:49] always believed in three because I don't think anyone believes like remembers more than three

[118:51] and if they can't remember there's no point in having them but those three typically are very

[118:56] bucketed terms that then need to have hundreds of behaviors underneath of them that kind of roll

[119:00] into that culture so like you only have three rules of behaving you have three concepts that have

[119:05] many applications across different conditions and so a big one that we've been focusing on

[119:12] Lail and I together has been kind not nice and so I think that in the wake of woqism if you will

[119:18] there's been a lot of accommodation that has been accepted or tolerated within businesses which is like

[119:24] everybody needs to have these like you know safety zones and everyone everyone has to feel hugged

[119:29] and fluffy and like all this stuff and I believe that this is a pendulum right and I think that

[119:35] the pendulum swung here and I think a lot of brands Walmart just came out recently rolling

[119:39] back some of its initiatives I know Victoria secret did last year like a lot of them were starting

[119:44] to swing back now I do think that we're going to swing too far the other way to be clear because that's

[119:47] how we do that that's how us humans do things right but I think it's going in the right

[119:50] direction right now which is going back towards the middle and so uh within acquisition.com we have this

[119:56] big belief that we're very good at training like we're very good at training skills because it's

[119:59] something that Lail and I pride ourselves on and we're in this in person environment we're good at

[120:02] fast feedback loops we're very good breaking skills down just smaller chunks to make them manage

[120:06] for somebody who's new the problem is that sometimes that goes into no man left behind and we are

[120:12] not a government program instead it should be if you can't keep up you can't come and so I think

[120:17] this is a departure from the traditional like all accepting let's all arms open like if someone

[120:23] you know has like you don't they don't like working late it's like well then this isn't for

[120:27] them and they can find another job that's that that will accommodate that but I do not because we

[120:31] are trying to accomplish great things and great things require great sacrifice and it doesn't

[120:35] feel like a sacrifice to the person who also wants the great thing it only feels like a sacrifice

[120:40] for someone who doesn't and so that price diminishes for someone who's aligned and so kind not nice

[120:45] also brings into into light like being able to have these sincerely candor's conversations of

[120:50] saying like you are not where you need to be and I'm going to give you a really good nug on this

[120:54] is that right now you can pause this video and I need you to show it to your team because what they

[120:59] don't understand is the difference between an insult and you might not understand either and this

[121:03] is like change my life insult and criticism so do you know the difference while explaining it so an

[121:09] insult is where basically you slander the other person you assign a word that has a negative

[121:15] connotation so I say something like you are lazy you are a piece of shit you're a dick you

[121:20] whatever whatever insert insert the insult you want a criticism is the gap between desired

[121:29] an actual this is a commentary which is factual which is the expectation is that you show up every

[121:36] day at 9 a.m. you've shown up every day at 9 o'clock therefore there's a discrepancy here

[121:43] in order for you to continue maintaining your employment you need to be here before 9

[121:47] so this is a criticism it's simply observing reality and if you can do this this will allow you

[121:54] to help people without having the emotional charge now if I say you're five minutes late

[121:58] and you're that makes you lazy or that makes you uncommitted or that makes you insert whatever

[122:04] insult it then turns this into an emotionally charged conversation and so what happens is and this is why

[122:09] I think it's important is that you need to explain your team criticism is not negative it's an

[122:13] observation of reality an insult is where we attach judgment to that discrepancy like your content sucks

[122:21] that's tough and the the secondary of that is you suck because you're content sucks which is even

[122:26] harder but instead it says our channel average is 100,000 the content that you make is 75,000

[122:35] in order for you to keep your employment here you need to be above 100,000 and now let's break down

[122:42] what do we need to do behaviorally that will increase the likelihood that you meet desired or exceed

[122:48] it and so then this is where you get to teach this is where you get to train if someone's always

[122:52] late to meetings they might not be lazy they just might not have the skill of showing up on time

[122:56] which is the skill and so you then say okay do you set alarms how do you estimate your time of driving

[123:03] do you do it on the fastest time you've ever driven somewhere or the slowest time you've ever

[123:06] driven somewhere right do you do it on the fastest time you've ever ground dressed or the slowest time

[123:10] you've ever ground dressed and so typically when people estimate time they usually just skewed

[123:14] one of these two things there's the people we're always way too early it's because they do worst

[123:18] case on everything and then you've got the people who are they do best case on everything and they're

[123:21] always late right so it's like how do you estimate time and how do you set reminders for yourself

[123:26] to get places by the time you need to and so literally breaking down that skill which seems obvious

[123:31] and yet there's many young people and to be fair sometimes old people who don't know how to show up

[123:36] on time and so understanding this and saying if we don't share this criticism we are being nice

[123:42] not kind we are not we are seeking a we are seeking contentment we are seeking approval from everyone

[123:50] we are seeking consensus we're not seeking truth and so we need to be truth seeking as a business

[123:56] and so we must always state the facts and tell the truth and if someone is not up to snuff

[124:00] we need to communicate that as fast as possible and give them the steps in order to remedy the

[124:06] situation and so this is the part I think both of these things get missed bosses will say he's a dick

[124:11] he's lazy he's whatever and sometimes will say to the person sometimes they behind their back

[124:14] both of those are bad instead I would encourage you to go criticism and then steps so

[124:20] the way to do this is you say tell them what to do instead so don't just say don't do this say do this

[124:27] instead of this that way you give them directions because no one can operate on a negative give them what to do

[124:33] and this has dramatically improved my skills and operator within the business and hopefully the

[124:39] kind not nice is something that you can give to your team and that you could say it's like we are here

[124:43] to be kind I want to help you win but I'm not here to be your friend and I think Reed Hastings has a

[124:49] really wonderful frame around this which is like we are a professional sports team trying to win the

[124:52] world championships we are not a family because you're not going to fire your kid you're not going to fire your

[124:57] space you're not going to fire your mother but if you're on a professional sports team it's like

[125:00] we're all here to win and if you don't want to win this is not the team for you there's triple a

[125:05] there's other teams there's other teams that are pros that don't want to win and that's fine but that's

[125:08] not what we have here and so the kindest thing that I can do for someone is give them clear feedback

[125:14] and opportunity to improve and if they don't improve give them the opportunity to work at a place where

[125:20] they will better fit it now that it's been five years and I'm back into operating day to day on the

[125:24] media and conversion team that we have at acquisition.com it's been fun to turn things around now I

[125:28] already went through the optimization framework and that's what I executed but the output of that

[125:33] was number one I removed all meetings number two I said you can have ad hoc standups between each

[125:38] other when you want to solve a specific problem so I don't want to I don't want to stop communication

[125:42] I just want to stop regular wasted time blocks that don't increase your output the next thing

[125:47] to be fair when I did all my one-on-ones with every single person that apartment to understand what

[125:51] they were struggling with one of the biggest things I came back was we're in meetings all day we

[125:55] were vaping and meetings I just want to work and I was like great let me make it easier for you to work

[125:58] the next thing was and this was feedback that I got from some of the managers when they saw me running this

[126:04] was they saw a framework that I like a lot which is what who when so think about when you have a

[126:12] meeting you're like hey we got to do this thing right that's the what all right then a lot of times

[126:16] that's it that's the meeting everyone just goes about this step away this the next level of that is okay

[126:21] this is what it is and this is who needs to do it so who's gonna own this who's gonna own this one right

[126:26] who's the the chest to chest to poke the threat to choke all right who's the one who's responsible now

[126:31] if you have what and who that's already a better stop but where it gets really nasty is when you put in

[126:35] when and so the question that I like to ask here is how many hours will this take I don't ask

[126:39] many days I don't ask what day you're gonna get it done by I see how many hours will this take and then

[126:44] that person will say it'll probably take because then you get to hear it so it's like if someone says like

[126:49] 20 hours I'm like 20 hours right but if if you ask them what day they might be like oh today's Tuesday

[126:54] I can get you by Friday and like why is it gonna take three days right so when you ask hours it's like

[126:58] this will probably take I don't know 90 minutes I'm like okay cool so you can get this done in the next 90

[127:05] now they will then say why have a mother thinks to do it I'm like okay what are those things

[127:09] and then you get to dive in and this is fundamentally I think the job of the boss is to prioritize

[127:13] this is strategy and they're like oh well I have this other thing that's for this massive project

[127:17] and I have to get that done I'm like well how long does that take and they'll say okay this many hours

[127:20] it's okay do that first and then this one you can start on tomorrow morning you haven't done

[127:24] by lunch so hit me up at noon tomorrow when you haven't done now people get scared about this because

[127:29] they're like why are you driving on these deadlines the more deadlines you have the more opportunities

[127:33] you have to say nice job I would rather tell someone you did a great job seven times in a week

[127:38] than once a week and so I also have found that the best performers want to work and they hate not

[127:44] working and they hate things they get in the way work they hate office politics they hate meetings they

[127:47] gossip they just want to work and so I want to create environment for those people and if there are

[127:52] a bunch of people who want to gossip and want to have lots of meetings and want to ideate all day

[127:57] amazing just not here with the who went framework this also gets stacked and recapped

[128:03] all right so think about how I'm meeting runs right so okay first thing we got to do is this okay

[128:08] what is it who's got it when you're going to get done by how long is that going to take can I pull it up can

[128:12] I pull it up yep that's fine all right great next one what's the next thing great who's going to

[128:17] own it how long is it going to take great you'll do it by this time and then so what we do is is I will

[128:21] recap every one of them every time and so by the time I've done my fourth one they've heard one four

[128:27] times two three times the third one two times and so there's this repetition that gets built in and then

[128:33] obviously the thing at the very end is also me the freshest so it's like I can repeat the least

[128:37] the thing that's the most fresh and the thing that I started with which is like way out of their

[128:41] mind at this point has been repeated like seven times and so it makes it more likely that they will

[128:45] actually do it now if you want to go the 201 version which I had to do for a little bit was

[128:50] repeat it back to me so I would say okay got it that's what you're going to do say back to me and

[128:56] kid you not if you ask them to say back this is crazy like one and three times they'll just completely

[129:01] get it wrong it's because they weren't listening they were paying attention whatever and so I'm like oh my

[129:05] god I can't believe that I was about to leave this meeting and they still they didn't understand

[129:09] what they needed to do and so you could stack the who what went you recap it all the way through and then

[129:13] if you haven't seen this not doing as well ask them have them explain it back to you so they know

[129:18] what needs to happen now once you have this loop in place what do we do we lubricate it we had money

[129:24] we had incentives so how can we align what they do with the outcome of the business and so back

[129:30] into ops I looked at everything eliminated all the meetings and then I said okay in this department

[129:35] everything is based on quality and so we just need to make better stuff and so I said if you make

[129:43] better stuff I will pay more I'd rather have one guy who makes three times the money then three

[129:48] mediocre guys in a very real way it's easier for me to manage one person there's way less communication

[129:53] there's way less over and way less waste and we'll get better outcomes and so if you're like okay

[129:59] I understand you did all this but how did you communicate with them if they had no meetings so I just

[130:04] switched to a daily stand up which is every day same time we all hop on and I run departments like sales

[130:11] teams all right and I think that you can do this with any business and the reason that I like modeling

[130:14] sales teams for two reasons one I've a lot of experience with them two I believe that the way sales

[130:18] teams are structured and operated have already been optimized for performance because the feedback

[130:23] looks so tight if you're not managing your sales team well you find out very quickly and as soon as you

[130:27] fix how you operate it you find out very quickly and so I think that sales teams overall are run

[130:32] typically very well now what are the things about sales teams so for new people when they come in what

[130:37] they do they listen to a lot of game tape this works for customer service this works for media this works

[130:42] for sales they watch a lot of the right way to do things then what happens there's a lot of role

[130:47] play in sales so it's if you could role playing customer service you could role play around what

[130:53] would you look at with this piece of content what would be the moments that you would clip out how

[130:58] would you structure it and you asked them to explain the work that they would do that's when someone

[131:02] knew is coming in and then we say okay we're going to give you a half calendar if you're a sales guy

[131:06] I'm going to give you a half calendar if you're a half calendar if you're a half calendar for media

[131:09] to make sure you're not posting tons of crap you're just going to get one post today and then if you

[131:13] do a good job you meet KPIs then you get a full calendar then I can give you an uncapped calendar

[131:18] right so we have these progressions as long as they maintain their quality metrics and so like sales

[131:24] we have a similar onboarding process the huddle process itself is let's look at the good stuff

[131:29] and let's tear apart the bad stuff so we've review a call that went well great and the far more

[131:34] valuable let's look at a call that wasn't they didn't go the way it should have and then we let the

[131:39] person who did the call correct themselves so it's really tough if you go jump in and like jump

[131:44] down to everyone's throw and tell them why they sucked it's much easier for them to say these are

[131:47] the things that I messed up and then the team gets to say here's all the things you did well that

[131:51] way they get some praise from everybody else but they still get to have that feedback and then you

[131:54] can prioritize okay this is the thing that's the most important but that still works for customer service

[131:59] it works for product it works for media which is okay why did this clip suck and let's look at it

[132:05] and if you notice a common theme for one clip suck then you just repeating it and reinforcing it keeps

[132:11] the top of mind we have switched to that process and it has been very good I also got people off the

[132:16] bus who weren't aligned with it and so if you have a change that you want to do and you foresee that

[132:20] people will not be aligned with that change then I think that you owe it to the high performers

[132:26] to to create an environment that is only other high performance you want to get it to the point where

[132:31] so self-managed and self-policed that if someone comes in and isn't pulling their weight they just

[132:36] get removed simple as that and the whole team comes to you like do you don't think this is the guy right

[132:41] it shouldn't come from you it should come from the culture of the team and that's why you can't have

[132:45] a culture of acceptance where it's no man left behind like oh they're not as good as we thought but

[132:49] we're just going to keep trying to know we're going to keep deploying these resources it's not to say

[132:53] that you can't train someone the question is is it worth it so the next big theme along

[133:00] operations all break us into another chunk is technical versus management all right and so this is

[133:05] very common in tech companies right you have an engineer who's exceptionally talented and you want to give

[133:11] them away to move up in the company but they don't want to manage people and in most companies the

[133:17] only way to move up is to increase the head count that's underneath of you and so when I saw this

[133:21] within our company I was like this feels dumb we should find a way for the best sales guys to keep

[133:26] making more more money which runs boys for the best media guys to make more money the best customer

[133:29] service so to make more more money especially in the roles that have high leverage so basically the

[133:34] best content creator has more leverage than the best sales guy best sales guy is closer to the

[133:38] reward though to be fair and so the likelihood that what they do generates revenue is much closer

[133:44] whereas marketing your content could be significantly further away so there's a discount that's applied

[133:48] there right but big picture is is there a track for both types of people because there are

[133:54] the people who are experts at something you just want to let them cook and so when I realize that the

[133:59] the the orgs that I basically the divisions that I took over the only way that someone would win was

[134:03] by moving up and when you have a the only reward structure is people underneath of you then what is

[134:09] that incentivize it incentivizes you keeping against yourself because if someone gets better than you

[134:14] then they move ahead of you and the line number one number two is it incentivizes the managers and the

[134:20] whole team to always ask to hire more people because if you hire more people that it means they buy

[134:24] to fall and move up in the organization the third thing is that whoever is in charge of the

[134:30] promotions and the titles becomes chief person who's asked we must kiss and that means that if you

[134:37] it basically becomes entirely subjective is to who gets promoted so then the next incentive that

[134:43] comes up that's perverse is you want to show how much you're working rather than do work

[134:50] which you're different and so this is where people are like if I said what did you do yesterday

[134:54] and I was like you need to give me a thousand bullets you could probably come up with a thousand

[134:57] bullets you're like I tied my shoes and then I stood up straight and then I put one panel on my

[135:02] right hand leg on and I put my left hand leg on and so people make it seem like they're just doing

[135:06] all of this work but they don't tie that work to the output of the division and when that happens

[135:12] is when you have misaligned incentives so every one of these incentives is perverse and that it

[135:16] doesn't fuel the business but it does fuel costs with this and with the aligned incentives the team

[135:22] post change has more than doubled output more than and so I think the lesson here and I think that

[135:29] we'll probably get to triple or quadruple like for real maybe I'll do an update later but this has been

[135:33] a recent takeover for me the thing is is that people typically have significantly more output

[135:39] if you can tap into what we call discretionary effort which is what is that effort above and beyond

[135:45] the minimum required to keep their job so everything above unociting fired is discretionary effort

[135:52] and in most companies there is a massive amount of effort above not getting fired that is

[135:58] unlockable if the incentives are aligned and so many people can in a very railway triple how much

[136:04] they're doing quadruple how much they're doing only if they're incentivized to and so when you have a

[136:10] political hierarchy it just means elbowing no one teaching each other anything saying we always need

[136:16] to hire more people decreasing your output to lowest potential possible as long as you don't get fired

[136:20] and this when coupled with a managed style of never firing is a great way to create waste so in order

[136:27] to facilitate this there typically has to be a change in compensation so I talked about incentives a

[136:32] couple of times through here and so my goal is to try and have everything be pay for performance

[136:38] the highest degree possible now here's where your operations and your finance team will push back

[136:42] they'll say this is complicated why can't we just do it the way everybody else does it because

[136:48] just because it's hard doesn't mean it's worth it so there's a price but there's also a return and so

[136:53] all they are talking about is the price of this thing not what we're going to get from it if I could

[136:58] then go back to that finance person and say hey and to be fair this is me saying anything about my

[137:02] finance I'm saying you might have to do with us hey if we were able to quadruple our output by creating

[137:07] a more complex incentive structure that might require someone full time just to manage is the

[137:13] cost of that one person full time managing it worth the increased output of four extra cross the entire

[137:19] company duh of course it is but it's more complicated and it's also worth it and so I bring this up

[137:26] because you will probably get push back if you try and incentivize people on performance it takes

[137:31] more math it takes more tracking but I will I will say one key part which is that if people are

[137:36] going to be paid on performance my recommendation is two things one if you make the transition

[137:41] allow them to keep their existing salaries and then add the performance on top and then for new

[137:46] people bring them in and then just have the performance but this allows completed adoption of the new way

[137:52] rapid reinforcement loops that they're like this is way better and then ultimately if you make

[137:56] the jumps in comp proportional to the output that you seek to get then you will still make more than

[138:02] the cost so it's like going it's going to the store buying three x output at twice the price of your

[138:07] one x it's still a better deal even though it costs more around this pay for performance it will also

[138:12] very clearly demonstrate who is really good and who is it and I haven't really talked about like

[138:18] letting people go who are low performers and I'll just only say this one word about it which is

[138:23] bloat is like cancer in a business or it's like weeds in a garden is that bloat naturally occurs

[138:31] people hire more people because the simplest solution is throw money in bodies that stuff and it's

[138:36] often not the right one you have to keep your garden healthy by pruning it by deweeting it you keep a

[138:44] tree healthy by cutting off the stray branches that are growing in the wrong direction because it's

[138:48] detracting from the growth of the overall trunk and so this is the part that that is that is probably

[138:54] contrary and for most of you fire when things are good not when they are bad so when things are good

[139:00] is when you have the most bloat and so it is far better to let people go at that point for low

[139:06] performance because it doesn't feel like the company's losing feels like we're being disciplined

[139:10] if you let people go only when the company performance drops it feels way worse having done both

[139:16] I strongly recommend the other so for example we were very fortunate but during COVID prior to COVID

[139:22] we had been very militant about making sure that we were making sure that everyone was efficient

[139:26] and that the that the head count made sense based on the demand and so when COVID hit we had

[139:31] very minimal amounts that we had to change internally in the business and so because of that

[139:38] I think it was able to maintain morale relatively well during a time when my industry was getting

[139:45] there's a number of ways you can do pay for performance and you don't need to have as much

[139:49] performance as you might think in order to incentivize action and so if you're like I don't have

[139:53] budget for that that's okay just just make a couple tiers of performance and then you can have flat

[139:58] bonuses by hitting some tiers like you can I mean it doesn't have you don't have to think in percentages

[140:03] it can just be flat amounts based on based on tiers and I think it's a very good structure and a

[140:07] good way to test this out is once you figure out your your compensation thing that you want to do

[140:11] back test it so just look at what it would have been the month before and then see what it is and if

[140:15] that makes sense then it's like cool well I'm going to assume the performances and go up if I pay for

[140:19] that added performance and I'm okay with this increase and if so which if you align it with the

[140:24] incentives of the business it should more than pay for itself the structures that I'm talking about

[140:27] with the sales team management functions best in my opinion when you have teams of similar function

[140:33] what that means is like an executive team is going to be very as many people with very different

[140:37] functions and expertise a customer service team has many people with the same function in expertise and so

[140:43] this style of management of you know reviews on boarding huddles what do we what could we do better here

[140:51] those are great when everyone does the same thing if everyone does different things you will have a

[140:57] different structure of maybe it's it's far more round table where everyone's more or less updating

[141:02] and then coming with the discussion topics that affect everybody else and problem solving together

[141:08] more than upskilling together so it's really probably the main difference between those is one is

[141:14] like we're really solving problems together for the majority of time not say you don't do any other

[141:17] way but the majority of time we're solving big problems with disparate teams or different teams

[141:22] diverse teams and then with similar teams homogeneous teams is typically upskilling together and

[141:26] aligning priorities so oh man this is a big one problems and solutions have delays all right so

[141:33] here me out on this right now you are living with problems that you created six months ago and

[141:39] when you begin to implement your solution the problem will not immediately go away and so there will

[141:45] be this period of time where you're executing a solution on a problem that you cost six months ago

[141:51] and you will still continue to live with the problem because the solution has not

[141:55] born fruit yet it hasn't latched in yet it hasn't come to fruition and so you have to give solutions

[142:01] the amount of time they deserve to work before appraising whether or not they worked to begin with

[142:07] which I recommend doing prior to implementing the solution so basically when you're about to do

[142:12] something to fix some problem say how long do I think this should take before I can say if it

[142:17] worked or not and then stick to that because in the moment you will only incur even more cost which is

[142:22] why it's so painful it's like you have this problem and now you're incurring more cost to try

[142:26] solving it and you're still suffering the problem and the cost of solving it without the benefit

[142:31] and so this is kind of the endurance part of entrepreneurship is that you have to keep working

[142:35] without seeing the result of your work you don't need to change anything you need to learn to

[142:40] endure because just because it's not working doesn't mean you're not on the right path and so

[142:45] the easiest way to think about this is like if you were to go to the gym and you start working

[142:49] out and you start eating better your 50 pounds overweight that problem was created years in the past

[142:56] you now incurring the solution is incurring the problem you're still overweight and the cost of

[143:02] the solution which is now you go to the gym now you're not eating the foods you like whatever

[143:06] but you're still overweight and so after seven days you might think okay well I should stop

[143:11] doing this because it's obviously not working you have to give time time for the solution

[143:16] proportional to the size problem it's solving and if you don't approach it this way and you

[143:21] ignore your problems when you scale you scale your problems with you which means that this is why

[143:28] I'm such a believer in solving the problems in order to scale rather than scaling despite my problems

[143:35] because then it just makes my problems bigger, heavier and nastier and so if you're living in

[143:39] good times right now you can't rest on the laurels because it's not from the work you're doing today

[143:44] it's from the work that you did six or twelve months ago and this has been a constant reminder for

[143:49] laylin eye when we go through things when things are good we're like what did we do six months ago

[143:53] that is causing this and if things are bad we ask what did we stop doing or what did we add in

[143:59] in the past that created this to often we look at today and think that our bad days because of

[144:05] what we did yesterday and it often isn't and so properly attributing where the cause of the solution

[144:12] or problem came from can give you the outsize return that you're probably looking for and I'll

[144:16] give you this very tactical tip if you see a decline in performance in a division or a function of

[144:23] the business you'll it'll typically look like this so let's say let's say that you know you've got

[144:26] this divinity let's say it's lead flow whatever and then it starts flattening now and then it starts going

[144:30] down right so you notice right so what happens is people wake up here and say we don't have enough

[144:37] leads right and so they say okay well show me the ads this week show me the ads last week so

[144:44] the question is what happened like where do you go do you go here where do you go here go here why did we stop

[144:53] growing not why did we start shrinking and so you have to look at where the delts are first

[144:57] occurred and then what happened in this what happened leading up to here what did we change

[145:02] oftentimes it's a who and here's a fun one a lot of people think oh we must have lost someone

[145:07] most of the times you added someone you added someone terrible I'm dead serious we had a we had an issue where

[145:15] our our sentient rates all of a sudden like I know I was like why are sentient you know and we started

[145:19] looking at all these different we looked at the functions we looked at messaging all this stuff and

[145:23] finally I was like and Layla brought it up she's like let's just look at the month when they stopped going

[145:28] up we looked at that month and we looked at what had happened the only change that had happened

[145:33] was that we had hired a new head we added someone to do the job and by adding this bad person

[145:41] they destroyed the function and like sometimes it's a house sometimes sometimes you change your process

[145:46] and sometimes that's the culprit but a lot of times you added someone who actively is destroying

[145:51] your business so another big lesson of this year was around content and so I made this video

[145:57] called back to business I don't think it was called that was basically we did this experiment

[146:00] for 16 weeks where we made very very wide content so like you know meals and workouts and vlogs and

[146:08] things like that where we wanted to see okay well if we get more views then maybe a percentage of

[146:13] those people will be business owners and so we are relative amount will go down that are

[146:17] business owners but our absolute amount will go up and so that's all I care about the absolute

[146:21] amount and so it turns out that that hypothesis was wrong at least for us and so when we made wider

[146:26] content we had fewer absolute amount of business owners who were opting in who were buying the

[146:33] books and so for me book sales is actually a very leading indicator for the people who we want

[146:37] coming towards acquisition.com and so and email opt-ins on the site that's had big one by the way

[146:42] if you're not subscribed to Mozi Mozi Money Minute it's one of the best things that I put out there

[146:47] it takes a minute and I deliver two every week that are extremely tactical things that you can

[146:53] immediately use to make more money like very tactical one of the best things up out there so I think

[146:57] you go to agusonocomfortslash newsletter and it's there so you can opt-in grab that I think you will

[147:05] like it's very good I put a lot of time to okay back to business so in finding that out we shifted

[147:12] our content indeed back to business and low and behold we got more business owners crazy but I think

[147:18] this is important because a lot of us phone to this wide views vanity trap and so being clear about

[147:25] why you're why you're making content to begin with is important if you're a business owner and

[147:29] you're making content because you want to make more money then you need to stay on point serve the

[147:35] avatar you serve and that has served us very well especially in the longest forms content I think

[147:42] the shorter stuff you can get away with what I would consider adjacent if you're a salon lady

[147:46] and you sell haircuts I know I'm butchering this but you get the idea then if you talk about beauty in

[147:52] general you will probably attract the type of avatar who spends money on these types of things and so I

[147:57] see that is okay but if you're gonna do a long video probably don't do it on makeup tutorials if you

[148:02] sell haircuts get the drift so another big part of this is that the structure of the content for entertainment

[148:08] is not the same as as education and so with education a lot of the effort is in the pre-production

[148:19] with entertainment a lot of the effort goes into post-production there's obviously pre as well

[148:24] but the post-production there's just got like think about making the transformers moving how much

[148:28] post-production is there in that would be a ton right whereas some of the top education videos on the

[148:34] internet are just a dude with a whiteboard which just goes down to the quality and the simplicity of the

[148:39] content itself and so you can make something significantly more compelling by making the language

[148:45] more readily accessible to your avatar now two components of this one is the examples that you use

[148:52] you want it to be as relevant to the after-responsible if I'm talking to you know a bunch of

[148:57] mechanics then I'll probably make a car analogy if I want to talk to a bunch of ladies I might use

[149:03] a cooking analogy right and that's with traditional gender roles and stereotypes deal with it all right

[149:07] and so the idea here is I will try and speak it away that I think has the highest likely head of

[149:13] being language that will be comprehended by the widest slice of my target audience now

[149:19] if you have an even broader audience then you would limit the amount of analogies to things that

[149:24] everyone understands so it probably be human things so I might be talking about just eating in general

[149:29] sleeping in general brushing your teeth in general would be the analogies that I would use and

[149:34] the grade language of my speech would be as low as you really possible so I looked at this

[149:39] politics thing this was before the selection but they had shown that the politician that spoke

[149:44] at the lowest grade level one every election now I don't know if that's helped you since then

[149:48] but I thought it was relatively telling with all of these different marketing strategies the one that

[149:53] mattered most was actually being understood which leads into one of the biggest next things that we did

[149:59] which was I'll put pre versus post here which for us because we are education we are focusing

[150:06] more on pre-production this video right now we prepared for hours like what are all the lessons

[150:11] I have what are the examples I want to talk about like this isn't me just turning on the camera

[150:15] and saying like what's up I actually put a lot into this and because I was a whole year it's also

[150:19] helpful for me because I like to crystallize my own knowledge but pre versus post and then another one is

[150:23] clear packaging right is just be very clear about what it is your content is about and what they're

[150:29] going to get from it and so from that we came up with the three peas which is proof promise plan

[150:39] and so every introduction of every video has to have these three things that doesn't have to but we

[150:44] found that when we include those things those videos did better and so you notice every video since

[150:48] this back to business theme we have proof promise plan within the first call it 30 seconds and so it's

[150:54] what are you going to get from the video why should you believe me and this is how we're going to do and so

[150:58] in this video I started with we have these three companies you know three of our companies are over 100

[151:01] million we see a lot this year we went from you know 50 million and you but it's just under 100

[151:05] you will learn the lessons from this so you can apply to your business and the plan that we're going to

[151:09] do is I'm going to walk through this step by step all right there we go right very straightforward and the

[151:13] last piece which was a small one which I actually got pushed back from my team on which is why I'm

[151:17] sharing it with you is introduce yourself right so a lot of people are like oh we don't want to introduce

[151:22] myself like my audience so we are well good thing you're not just making it for them you're making it for

[151:26] people who don't know who you are yet right and so what we did is that we've actually not consolidated

[151:30] this to lower third and so at the beginning of this video you should see you know Alchromozy

[151:36] Manage Partner acquisition dot com so we actually able to cut that out of me saying it because we want to

[151:40] keep the interest really tight but if known those who you are I also have taken out the uh

[151:46] hey if you don't know I am just say I'm Alchromozy I'm the Manage Partner Vacquisitor.com this is what we do

[151:52] or put it lower third and then just skip for right you you want to keep it as tight as

[151:57] usually possible and when we look back in the videos that did exceptionally well these were the

[152:01] things that these were our common things we put more in pre we introduced ourselves we made it very

[152:05] clear packaging we had a proof promise plan that was laid out we had examples that were clear and

[152:10] relevant to our avatar which is business owners and so we made content about business in loan

[152:16] it has been good and on a personal note I prefer making business content to not business content I

[152:20] like resent it I'll be really really I I was so I was afraid of the results that were going to

[152:25] come in because I was like if I'm gonna have to make meal videos I'm gonna kill myself I just like

[152:29] I like they will do our workouts next I'm like no I'll just I'll just be dead it won't matter like

[152:34] it doesn't it I'll just die and so I'm sure from like the thing is is that I've relatively

[152:39] I paint all it so like if it was the way to win I would like if you were like hey if you hit

[152:43] your hand with this hammer your business keep growing like my hand would be a pancake right I

[152:47] would just keep going at it but I would prefer not to do it that way and I'm very grateful that you

[152:52] guys like business comes a better because that's what I like making too so the next one is a

[152:57] around platforms and I think this was really interesting so I looked really deeply at the platforms

[153:02] from this last year and so I made a whole tier list video about this so I'm not gonna go and super

[153:08] depth on this but I would say that the MVP of the year was email or maybe most improved if you

[153:14] want to call it that way I have not traditionally spent a long time on email which seems ridiculous

[153:18] because written word is my best format duh and so I started writing emails and they start doing

[153:24] well duh like maybe I should hit money less I don't know anyways so email was kind of the MVP

[153:30] of the year for me probably that like the most improved like didn't expect it the feedback I've

[153:34] gotten as a bit exceptional and I made it also a separate video on how I just write my emails and so you

[153:38] can watch that I'm sure it'll be I'm sure you can find it all right beyond that though Facebook was a

[153:44] in terms of like book sales per follower count and per view count was kind of like the highest leverage

[153:50] like we actually got a lot from that so we're investing more in Facebook right now the perennial

[153:54] champs were IG and YouTube in terms of percentage of traffic that came to acquisition.com YouTube

[154:00] Instagram were by far the biggest ones the unbeknownst one was books this is one that no one talks

[154:06] about but Amazon is actually responsible for like 15% of my traffic which kind of cool meaning

[154:12] basically the amount of people who buy books and then read the books and then go to the site a huge

[154:16] percentage of my traffic indirectly comes from Amazon because they because my books do really well

[154:21] and have a lot of reviews and and Amazon wants to have people buy products that they like on

[154:25] Amazon because then they associate the good things from their product with Amazon right it's like

[154:29] they have a strategy and I also said in my tier list video that TikTok was something that I was

[154:34] depriorizing and I thought more about that since that video so it's been like seven months I

[154:38] think it's something that video I think that it's not that TikTok is not a good platform for business

[154:43] I think that we had a skill gap around TikTok and so I'm actively trying to remedy that right now

[154:48] and bringing in some really amazing people I'm from TikTok side it's a platform I don't know very well

[154:52] and so we're going to just bring in great people and in the line there incentives and see what happens

[154:57] but fundamentally I know there are business owners on TikTok I just haven't been able to

[155:01] package my content in a way that did well in that platform but if you're curious since we made the

[155:06] incentive change our TikTok is up 300% this week so you know incentives work and speaking of those

[155:13] platforms I would recommend checking out my email I did say it earlier most of you many minutes I put a lot

[155:20] of time into them I think they're really good if you like my books you love the emails it's like

[155:24] like super super distilled down that really proud of it it just it just worked out really well and so I think

[155:30] I think you will like them it's agus is not comfortable for such a newsletter and by the way if you haven't read the

[155:35] books for the love of God it's the best stuff I have so like if you like my videos you will like the books more

[155:40] strap you'll like them more they're better and I feel like I can say that objectively like I work on both of them

[155:45] and I think that and it's just fundamentally it's because I haven't spent two thousand hours on a video I have

[155:49] spent two thousand hours on a book so hundred million all our offers hundred million all your

[155:52] it's check them out if this was valuable for you it would mean the world to me if you shared it with another

[155:57] entrepreneur or people inside of your team is the only thing that encourages me to keep doing this

[156:02] as I shout into the dark abyss share it on your stories text to friends it it it would mean a lot I don't

[156:07] have sponsors for this thing and so that is my only ask otherwise stay awesome

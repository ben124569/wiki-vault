[00:00] And so right now I have $2 billion passed.

[00:02] Almost the worst case scenario to do.

[00:03] Anything that damages your reputation is irreversible.

[00:06] You only get one reputation and you literally can't bankrupt yourself out.

[00:08] Fuck it.

[00:14] One of the hardest decisions in entrepreneurship is deciding which path to follow.

[00:18] Especially when you have two or multiple good paths.

[00:20] I'm at a point in my career where I do have a very large decision that I need to commit to for multiple years.

[00:26] And I've been spending basically every week.

[00:28] And I were trying to gather more data to make the right decision.

[00:30] One of my favorite things to do when I do have big decisions is to change my environment.

[00:34] And I think it happens multiple times.

[00:35] My favorite place to think is actually on planes.

[00:37] I often have very few distractions on my planes.

[00:40] And I quite literally get perspective.

[00:42] Like I'm flying up and I'm looking down at the earth.

[00:44] I feel like I always make really good decisions on them in the air.

[00:47] And it's actually something that I really look forward to.

[00:50] You know, I've been waiting for since I've been married.

[00:52] Going to chillies.

[00:53] We've bonded to Liza.

[00:54] I have like a seizure.

[00:55] Honestly, I would go because I don't mind.

[00:58] I don't care about the style of the rest of the rest.

[00:59] But I do not like their food.

[01:00] I think it did amazing chips.

[01:02] Great salsa.

[01:03] And the fajitas are strong.

[01:04] I hate that you go hard on this in front of people because I'm behind the goals.

[01:07] Or is it a yes on a good?

[01:08] If there's any time, like in the finest averages that I go to that we've got to now like five times,

[01:13] like we'll go.

[01:14] It should be like sucks, right?

[01:15] It sucks.

[01:16] Say it.

[01:17] Say it.

[01:17] It's not as good as the finest dining in the world.

[01:19] Just say it.

[01:20] I feel like yes.

[01:20] It's not as good.

[01:21] See?

[01:22] And then that's it for the rest of my life.

[01:24] It's really good.

[01:25] You're chilly, you're good.

[01:26] You're gonna like a stomach ache from it.

[01:27] I mean, who are you talking about here?

[01:29] Yeah.

[01:30] Who are we talking about?

[01:31] I think you're telling me your story.

[01:33] So we just landed in San Diego.

[01:36] And we are going to reals event, which is a big public-rated brokerage for reals

[01:41] that agent, our really close friend Shoransrivotsa, president of the company.

[01:45] He invited us out.

[01:46] We're probably going to have dinner with him.

[01:47] We're going to speak there tomorrow.

[01:48] I will be making a presentation to help reals that agents sell more houses, but it will not

[01:53] be about reals that.

[01:54] They don't either soccer be great, of course, I'm in the street.

[01:57] It was like, how do I stop doing all these routines of like I can't even start?

[02:02] I like tried to smoke cigarettes to get a dick to someone.

[02:04] I was like, I just threw this too hard.

[02:05] It was just too hard to stick with.

[02:06] It's like every morning, it's like what if it were good?

[02:15] The hardest part about growth is that the better you get, the bigger you get, the bigger

[02:19] the opportunities are and the better they are.

[02:21] I think the easiest limit to test is to determine how big of an opportunity is worth your

[02:26] attention.

[02:27] So right now, 10X is kind of my limit to test.

[02:29] It's like, we're at 100.

[02:30] It's got to be a billionaire more for it to be something than I want to dedicate time to.

[02:34] And so right now, I have, without considering $2 billion pass, they're very different.

[02:38] Relatively irreversible.

[02:39] It one has potentially more upside, but more risk.

[02:42] The other one is more certain, but has lower upside.

[02:44] There's lots of things they can make a decision irreversible.

[02:46] They're just, if it's a certain percentage of your net worth of capital, I don't like making

[02:50] those kinds of bets.

[02:51] This is a quote from Trump's Rota, buddy of mine, he said, never want to bet the empire

[02:54] for a pot of gold.

[02:55] You bet what you have in need for something you don't have in don't it?

[02:58] It's never a good bet.

[02:59] Anything that damages your reputation is irreversible.

[03:01] It's only going to get one reputation.

[03:02] You literally can't make your self out of a bad reputation.

[03:04] You can't make, take reputational risk where there's only downside.

[03:08] Now, if I were to say, like, I want to support this cause, I might piss off some people,

[03:12] but it'll move me towards a different group of people.

[03:15] So then in that case, that's a trade-off more than it's a risk.

[03:18] And so that's different than when I'm talking about here.

[03:20] And then you just have time, time that you can't get back.

[03:23] Every moment you spend always has the opportunity to cost what you could have done with

[03:26] that time to get a higher return.

[03:28] I think the number one person that I have on YouTube is about that concept is the only

[03:33] base thing we have is time and we make trades for stuff.

[03:38] And so the people who are better at trading it for more stuff get more stuff.

[03:41] There is this story that Tony Robbins told that I really like.

[03:44] It's just kind of illustrated this image.

[03:46] It's like rich people make bets where they can't lose on either way.

[03:49] Like so there's this guy who knows that nickels now dare made with nickel.

[03:52] Whatever the material they make nickel with is more valuable than the cost of a nickel.

[03:56] His billionaire knows that's taken the nickel.

[03:58] He's putting it in storage as an investment because the day that they change or

[04:02] remove that nickel from currency because it makes no sense.

[04:04] He'll melt it and get 40% on his money.

[04:07] But there are investments that are high return low risk.

[04:10] You want to find those bets?

[04:11] How's it going?

[04:12] You're good man.

[04:13] What's up?

[04:15] Treasury founder.

[04:16] We just find banks in the US.

[04:17] They really paid the high trades on the account.

[04:18] We'll give me your card.

[04:19] I don't have a card.

[04:20] I got a week there.

[04:21] See you take a picture of me.

[04:22] It messaged me and then the guy who made his money looks and we got it.

[04:24] There you go.

[04:25] Oh we got to get a good line in here.

[04:26] Do it right now so I can tell them.

[04:28] Yeah.

[04:29] We can get more cut, more return on our cash.

[04:31] We're in a hot zone.

[04:32] Hot zone for recognition.

[04:33] What's all like entrepreneurial people?

[04:35] Looks like this gentleman.

[04:37] No, half measures.

[04:38] That's right.

[04:39] You know, I'll tell you that story man.

[04:41] We're running dimmage making a lot of money.

[04:43] I got to ask to speak at this personal trainer conference.

[04:46] I was like, yeah sure.

[04:47] I'll talk.

[04:48] I wasn't being asked to speak.

[04:49] I was in making content like this.

[04:50] It wasn't like a normal one.

[04:51] I was like sure how I'll come talk.

[04:53] I was like so what are we going to do?

[04:54] He's like why are you just like give a lot of value and then you can present your

[04:58] thing or whatever.

[04:59] I was like okay cool.

[05:00] I made this really long presentation.

[05:02] It was just like very, very good.

[05:03] And then at the end, I had the full presentation webinar of how to sell that I used to

[05:08] sell it before.

[05:09] And I was like, you guys probably don't need to see all this stuff.

[05:12] Like okay, you get it like personal trainer, you know, it's important.

[05:15] You got it on the hotel, you got it on the system.

[05:18] At the end I was like yeah, and here's the prize and I dropped it and I was like, you know,

[05:20] I just went as fast as I could through it.

[05:22] And I didn't even, I said it like I'm saying right now.

[05:24] I didn't like actually say it.

[05:26] And so then I revealed the price.

[05:28] And so I did what would have been a 90 minute presentation pitch in like 15 minutes.

[05:32] After giving three hours plus a value.

[05:34] So I was like this should make sense.

[05:35] I gave a shitload of value and then I'll just soft toss it.

[05:38] Right.

[05:39] And I got so much resistance from the crowd.

[05:41] There was the biggest flop of a presentation I ever gave my entire life.

[05:43] I didn't even think, I think I made two sales.

[05:45] Like it was nothing, right?

[05:46] Now I had done a half measure.

[05:47] And so it's either sell or don't sell.

[05:49] Don't be a between.

[05:50] You either give value or you sell shit.

[05:53] Don't try and mix them.

[05:54] If we want to make commitments in anything or you're trying to go all in on a decision,

[05:58] one of the best ways to do that is to eliminate the possibility of going back on it.

[06:01] A lot of people will spend most of their lives being half in half out, which to me is just

[06:06] not in it all.

[06:07] It just gives them an excuse to feel like they're making progress when they really are.

[06:10] There's a lot of books that talk about going pro, going all in, burning the boats.

[06:13] And I think they all kind of go along the same point, which is that sometimes you have to

[06:16] make a bet and be willing to be wrong, knowing that if you make no bet you're guaranteed

[06:20] to be wrong.

[06:21] But yeah, for tomorrow, everybody there knows more about selling houses than I do.

[06:25] My proof point of that is that they have all sold more houses than I have.

[06:28] So what am I going to see stem about selling houses?

[06:29] Right.

[06:30] I think it would be silly for me to try and compete on that because there's other speakers who've

[06:33] both done it and been there more than me.

[06:35] So I feel like that would be a terrible position to take.

[06:37] What I am going to do is say, if I were to start,

[06:39] I would win.

[06:40] But if selling houses means winning, it'll apply.

[06:44] How's it going?

[06:45] Michael Neshtimich.

[06:46] I'm going to ask him to answer.

[06:47] Thank you.

[06:48] Thank you, thank you.

[06:49] Thank you.

[06:50] Thank you.

[06:51] I appreciate it.

[06:52] That's nice.

[06:53] Nice to meet you.

[06:54] Nice to meet you.

[06:55] Nice to meet you.

[06:56] Riley, right?

[06:57] See you guys.

[06:58] When I was in high school, I read the spoke all out how to make friends and influence

[06:59] people.

[07:00] And I think the second chapter is something called people by their name.

[07:01] It's their favorite word in the whole language.

[07:03] And I was like, oh, that's interesting.

[07:04] Your favorite word in the entire language is your own name.

[07:06] So you love hearing that word.

[07:08] And when they're in the other word, wash it, say that a lot of times if somebody likes

[07:10] that word, think about this from a leverage perspective.

[07:12] If you haven't seen somebody in a year, and then you show up at a conference, then you're

[07:16] like Steve.

[07:17] And he doesn't remember your name.

[07:19] He loses all average.

[07:21] You're the good guy.

[07:22] And so you have so much more leverage than the conversation for a member.

[07:25] Thank you for calling.

[07:26] The book is Reservations Center.

[07:28] I've got to see if I can get in there with a tank top and water samples.

[07:32] Thank you for calling.

[07:33] Stay calm.

[07:34] Stay be speaking.

[07:35] How can we help you?

[07:36] Amy, how are you today?

[07:37] Hello.

[07:38] Amy?

[07:39] I'm good.

[07:40] Quick question for you.

[07:41] I've reservation at 7.30.

[07:44] What's the dress code?

[07:45] We don't turn anyone away unless you're working a follow.

[07:49] Or it's short.

[07:50] Women's suits.

[07:51] It will pick up.

[07:52] Well, if you've never turned anyone away before, then I might just have to risk

[07:56] because I can't go back to my house on the time.

[07:58] I'll tell.

[07:59] I'll tell.

[08:00] OK.

[08:01] I'm going to say Amy said it was OK.

[08:02] I don't think that's a problem.

[08:03] I'll get that sooner or later on.

[08:05] I'll let them know.

[08:06] I'll just be OK.

[08:07] Thank you so much, Amy.

[08:08] You're alive, Sarah.

[08:09] I think you're like that with the ice cream.

[08:10] So we're on our way to an ice cream shop and it's closing at the time we're about

[08:15] to get there.

[08:16] Lay-look.

[08:17] She's like, we should call to make sure that we can get in.

[08:20] And I was like, hey, how's it going?

[08:22] My wife needs ice cream on me in the dog house.

[08:26] I was like, what are the chances?

[08:27] One in a million that you guys can stay up in five minutes later.

[08:29] So I get to my house.

[08:30] I'll be in it now.

[08:31] I'll be the fastest ice cream man you've ever seen.

[08:33] And they're like, OK.

[08:35] But you just can't tell anyone.

[08:36] I was like, I'll take it to the grave except for this content I'm making right now.

[08:42] And she let us in and we got the Sundays.

[08:44] I've done a lot of phone sales and I've done a lot of in-person sales and there's a lot

[08:48] of mini skills that you learn in sales that are useful in every other environment where

[08:52] you need to get people to do something that you want them to do.

[08:54] The ideal way of doing is getting them to want to do the thing that you want them

[08:58] to do rather than having them feel like they're doing you a favor.

[09:01] The way that you ask, the tone that you ask, the last that you make, the jokes that you

[09:05] make, all of those micro things, I do those things so that the person on the other end

[09:11] feels like if they see me in person, it will be a positive experience.

[09:15] And they want to have that reward and so they're willing to push or bend the rules a little

[09:20] bit so that I can do whatever it is that I'm trying to do or get in a restaurant or dessert

[09:24] or whatever it is.

[09:25] People do nice things when they're in nice moods.

[09:28] So it's like get them in a good mood first then ask for the nice thing.

[09:41] I kind of had this process that sort of works.

[09:45] I'll outline what I'm going to say like far in advance and then the day before I'll change

[09:49] half of it.

[09:50] Oh we get the view.

[09:52] I'd pay the entrance.

[09:53] I'll pay the entrance.

[09:59] And then we notice that your presentation on 300 plus lines.

[10:03] I finished it like 20 minutes ago.

[10:05] Yeah it looks good.

[10:06] Yeah and if it doesn't, I'll just run it.

[10:09] Okay.

[10:10] Usually I get more of my adrenaline now and by the time I get on stage it's like I'm

[10:14] done with that kind of thing.

[10:15] It's always directly proportional to prep.

[10:17] It'll be the first time I talk to that any of this stuff that I'm talking about in a

[10:21] keynote.

[10:22] I love this tall boy.

[10:24] This is great.

[10:26] Get a little bit of sugar, a little bit of caffeine, a little bit of delicious.

[10:32] And a little bit of a bucket.

[10:34] How many people?

[10:35] 350.

[10:36] I had a hundred slides.

[10:40] I have 300.

[10:41] Oh my god.

[10:42] I'm looking forward to it.

[10:44] Oh thank you.

[10:45] Have you ever done a real estate audience?

[10:47] No, I don't think so.

[10:49] I'm not, I don't talk to real estate.

[10:50] It's just going to be useless for them.

[10:51] It'll be like what a waste of an hour.

[10:53] I'm sorry.

[10:54] Yeah.

[10:55] All right.

[10:56] It's fucking hard.

[10:57] I'm not going to make fun.

[10:59] You're my friend Alex.

[11:01] Horrible.

[11:02] Yeah.

[11:09] Why do you guys already know how to win because you know how to lose?

[11:12] So flip it.

[11:13] You guys know how to win better than I could ever tell you.

[11:15] Imagine your success by whether you completed the actions that would make it unreasonable

[11:18] that you will not fail and then you succeed by default.

[11:21] And everyone here has things that they've written down from many of the talks of things

[11:25] that you want to do or want to think about or whatever.

[11:27] I would encourage you to make that a list of things that you will do.

[11:31] And then when you go back to the same condition, your same home, your same house, your

[11:34] same market, your same whatever, you change your behavior.

[11:37] And then that will show that you learn and you took one step to becoming the person

[11:40] that you ultimately want to be.

[11:46] This stuff is all top of mind in terms of making actions that would make it unreasonable

[11:50] that I fail with a billion dollar decisions because that's actually decision making right now.

[11:53] I'm at a point in my career where I have enough what I would consider singles double

[11:57] striples that I have decided to take a bigger swing.

[12:02] I'll either win or I'll learn the same as you.

[12:05] From the bottom of our heart Alex, you impact our life, they know man we appreciate it.

[12:09] Thank you guys.

[12:10] Thank you.

[12:11] All I want to do when you're not going to do is 0.0.0.1.

[12:15] That's all I want to do.

[12:18] You can be here too.

[12:20] You can be 100x you.

[12:22] Thank you Alex.

[12:23] You're good.

[12:24] Press.

[12:25] Very nice and you appreciate you.

[12:26] Thank you.

[12:27] Appreciate you.

[12:28] Yeah sure.

[12:29] That's still trap bro.

[12:30] I'm sorry.

[12:31] I'm sorry.

[12:32] I'm sorry.

[12:33] I'm sorry.

[12:34] I'm sorry.

[12:35] I'm sorry.

[12:36] I'm sorry.

[12:37] I'm sorry.

[12:38] I'm sorry.

[12:39] I'm sorry.

[12:40] I'm sorry.

[12:41] I love seeing most of the nation in the wild.

[12:43] I love the hustle.

[12:44] I love everyone coming up and sharing their stories like that always makes my day.

[12:48] I would say that I do it in a place where you won't get put in handcuffs for sneaking in.

[12:53] Come up when you see me in public.

[12:55] If you can, I'm happy to say hi.

[12:57] Take pictures whatever.

[12:58] Don't go into areas where you're not supposed to go in order to try it.

[13:01] Hang out because it usually just does it end well.

[13:04] It's probably one of you.

[13:05] Very nice to meet you.

[13:06] Thank you so much.

[13:07] Appreciate it.

[13:08] So that was great.

[13:09] I did my keynote earlier in the day.

[13:11] I think people liked it.

[13:12] They may not have.

[13:14] I think they sat through regardless.

[13:16] I think we're probably going to have the afternoon.

[13:17] Probably a couple hours probably walk around.

[13:19] I know I had back.

[13:20] Two last day, guys.

[13:22] Can you see that?

[13:23] You can.

[13:24] You can.

[13:25] See you.

[13:26] Can I continue to talk about the redness?

[13:28] See, I say most content.

[13:31] Yep.

[13:32] There we go.

[13:38] Back in the day when I had one on one.

[13:40] There was a one guy who I was like so.

[13:44] I felt like what have you done for personal improvement.

[13:46] Like what do you, you know, maybe he's like yeah, you know.

[13:48] It's so crazy.

[13:49] Like I realized it.

[13:50] If I don't watch, if I can't watch as much while I'm working, I get like so much more

[13:54] done.

[13:55] I was like there's so many things wrong with that statement.

[13:57] You were telling me probably just like just level one of it.

[14:01] You see, level two of it is easy.

[14:03] Is it like you mentioned that you're doing.

[14:05] No that you were watching.

[14:06] No fixing general while you were working.

[14:08] Point three is that you didn't actually say you were going to stop.

[14:11] You just said that you cut back on how much Netflix you were watching while you were working.

[14:17] And it's just like there's so many stupidities interwoven into so few words.

[14:21] I was flabbergasted.

[14:23] So you're more productive when you don't watch Netflix movies.

[14:26] And I had not as much as much as many shows in a row while you're being paid at your job.

[14:34] Yeah, it's been great.

[14:41] That's pretty.

[14:45] That is pretty.

[14:46] All right.

[14:47] So if you're at the crossroads between one decision that you're trying to choose, which is in two different paths.

[14:55] If it's the first go round, I would encourage you to take the lower risk path that has a higher chance of success if it's a business.

[15:03] There are stories of just unbelievable entrepreneurs, but we don't hear the tens of thousands of entrepreneurs who make that massive bit.

[15:10] And then lose everything and lose five eight years of their lives.

[15:13] If you are going to make the big swing and kudos to you, it's an absolute personal decision for in the books.

[15:18] Go on and fully commit a limited alternatives.

[15:20] No half measures.

[15:22] Because what I can guarantee you is that if you are going after the big swing, the way to guarantee that it does not work is to go.

[15:30] Have to.

[15:31] So if you're going to win, make it unreasonable that anything that was in your control was not controlled for.

[15:37] And then only lose for things that were not a year.

[15:40] What do you think top five?

[15:41] For me I go a major in all times.

[15:43] I'd be willing to put dark night as number two.

[15:45] It's just like you such a good feeling.

[15:47] It's just like it's just like it's just like the intro scene.

[15:50] It's just like one of the awesome best scenes ever.

[15:52] I really like the old.

[15:54] I do like gladiator.

[15:55] I think I'm also pro.

[15:56] You got one that's not like actually.

[15:58] Probably my favorite comedy.

[16:00] Fuck, no.

[16:01] I could see art.

[16:02] I was like 40 old virgin wedding crafters.

[16:04] Super bad and surprise.

[16:07] Of rides, I could ride there.

[16:09] It was like I could bring.

[16:11] I was tired.

[16:12] Yeah, I mean I went because of body mine at the job that I was at.

[16:15] It was like, let's go see it.

[16:16] And I was like five.

[16:17] So I like had a couple drinks and like went to the theater.

[16:20] And I like was hyper bad at lighting.

[16:22] It's like a super fun stuff.

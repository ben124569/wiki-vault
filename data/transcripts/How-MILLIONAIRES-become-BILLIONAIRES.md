[00:00] One of the biggest shifts that I had as an entrepreneur going from, you know, making a few hundred thousand dollars a year or a million dollars a year to

[00:05] making, you know, just in our nine figures like we do now has been a simple understanding that I'm going to try and hit at a couple different ways.

[00:11] And hopefully you'll be able to shift your perspective in terms of how you see product and delivery.

[00:18] And so right now, if you're not making the amount of money that you want to make, it's because the product that you have is not good enough.

[00:23] And it's really hard to confront that fact, but if you really do and sit here, I can't tell you the amount of times I talk to entrepreneurs and they're like,

[00:29] Man, if I just had more people, if more people would just find out about my product, then all my problems will be solved.

[00:34] But the reality is that if you have any amount of customers, then people already have found out about your product.

[00:39] And for one reason or another, they have chosen not to tell anyone else about it.

[00:42] And you have to sit with that for a second.

[00:45] If to realize that like people have found out about your product and they're not referring people, and you have to ask, why?

[00:50] Why are these people not sending me business?

[00:52] And so one of the, one of the first times I heard a statement that I really liked about this was from being Kennedy and he said,

[00:57] most small entrepreneurs trying get customers to make sales.

[01:03] Bigger entrepreneurs try to make sales to get customers.

[01:08] And the difference is one person is all about trying to get to the money as fast as possible.

[01:13] What do I need to say to get this person say, that's what I need to say to get this person to buy.

[01:16] How do I get the money?

[01:18] The other way is how do I make some sort of exchange so that I can now create a long time relationship with this customer and continue to provide value over time?

[01:26] One has a compelling view and perspective on time and value and the other is short-sighted.

[01:32] And I can tell you the difference between the people who are millionaires that I am friends with and people who are billionaires that I am friends with.

[01:38] This is probably one of the most fundamental differences.

[01:40] And so I was talking to a friend of mine who's worth a million and he was saying, if it's not going to grow on its own over time, it's not worth doing.

[01:49] And I really sat with that for a second.

[01:50] And it was like, if I, if you put in a one-time effort, like this is what, this is how people who are the ultra-wealthy think.

[01:58] If you put one-time effort into something and it compounds over time, then that is an enterprise or product that they want to continue to invest in.

[02:06] On the flip side, if you have to consistently shop and consistently promote and consistently get out there and sell and sell and do all this stuff,

[02:13] then when it's happening is that the product itself is not good enough, right?

[02:17] Because people in and of themselves are not referring business.

[02:21] And so let me give you three questions that really changed and hopefully will alter your perspective like they did mine around product and service.

[02:29] And so the first is, if I have an existing product or service and I would have made it 10 times more expensive.

[02:35] So really think about the price.

[02:36] So, or you can say, $100,000 or $1 million, whatever it is, right?

[02:39] Just a huge number.

[02:41] And if that's how much I'm retarging for it, what would I need to do?

[02:45] What would the experience need to be?

[02:47] What would the product need to deliver in order to for it to be worth that much?

[02:51] What happens is you start thinking in a very different type of mindset about how much value have to create, right?

[02:57] And so that is the first question that I ask.

[03:00] There's two more in the third one's my favorite and I'll get to in a second.

[03:03] The second question I ask is, if this product that I have cost one tenth as much as it does right now,

[03:10] but I had to make it better than it currently is, what would I need to do?

[03:14] What one time asks is what I need to create that would consistently provide value that I could do at scale that could I could do profitably, right?

[03:21] So first question, if this were 10 times expensive or $100,000 million,

[03:27] this is what I charge for my product, what would it need to be?

[03:30] What would the experience need to be?

[03:32] And what value would I need to deliver in order for it to be worth that much?

[03:35] The second question is if it were one tenth the cost.

[03:40] But I had to make it better than my current product or service.

[03:43] What else would I create or do or make in order to facilitate that outcome?

[03:48] And the third question which is probably my favorite, which I think underpins the entire ideology that I'm hitting on here,

[03:53] is if I had a business and I were only allowed to sell one more customer.

[03:59] And the rest of the growth of my business had to come from that customer without me asking,

[04:04] as in that that customer's experience was so remarkable, was so positive, was so amazing,

[04:09] that they alone had to on their own volition tell other people about my service,

[04:16] what would need to happen, what would need to happen to create that experience.

[04:20] And when thinking about all three of these product frames,

[04:23] I like them because they kind of hit on different aspects of the product.

[04:26] The first question, which is a $100,000 million question, hits on value,

[04:31] which is how do I create the most value in the product itself?

[04:35] The second question hits on the profit of the product,

[04:37] because if it's one tenth of cost and I have to make it better,

[04:40] this means I don't have to do high margin, one time investment type things to make the entire product more valuable.

[04:45] So that hits on profit.

[04:47] So first is the value of the product.

[04:48] The second is the profit to me, right, as a business owner.

[04:52] And the third question hits on the experience, which is, what's the customer experience,

[04:56] which is everything else that surrounds the product that we're selling or service that we're selling, right?

[05:00] What is the experience that has to occur in order for this customer to become a raving fan,

[05:05] that it's so good that they remark about it, that cannot help themselves but remark about it?

[05:10] And what's interesting is that every super wealthy person that I know pretty much exclusively talks about products,

[05:16] and usually the really small people that I know only talk about promotion.

[05:20] And promotion should really only exist to get your product right,

[05:25] and then once it is right, then you can juice it and then let it go and take care of itself.

[05:30] And the reason that it's so important at least in my opinion,

[05:32] is that if you think about the six ways of getting customers, right,

[05:35] and if you don't know what those are, it's paid media, earns media.

[05:38] So paid media is advertising, right, in promotions.

[05:41] Ernd media is following, right, if you have any kind of organic following.

[05:44] The third is through your contact list, so people in your phone and your email list,

[05:49] instead of the you already own their contact information, the fourth is through manual outbound.

[05:53] So that's DMs, cold emails, cold calls, cold all of that stuff where you reach out to people.

[05:58] The fifth is through affiliate, so partners who can promote your stuff.

[06:02] And the sixth, which is the most powerful and the only one that compounds is word of mouth.

[06:08] So think about that for a second.

[06:10] Every of the other five ways of acquiring customers is not compounding.

[06:15] Those are linearly scaled, right?

[06:17] I mean, if you double the amount of outbound people you have,

[06:20] you double the amount of customers that you get.

[06:22] If you double your ad spend, you might be able to double the amount of customers you get.

[06:26] Sometimes it's less than that.

[06:27] But you get the idea, they skill relatively linearly, right?

[06:31] Whereas word of mouth referrals, which is the sixth way of getting customers,

[06:34] is the only one that compounds.

[06:36] It multiplies rather than is additive.

[06:40] All right, if you get two people to tell two people,

[06:42] and those people tell two people that it continues to compound,

[06:44] and that is what creates enterprise value.

[06:46] That is what creates an enduring thing.

[06:48] And that is what when you spend the extra time to make the product so good that people have to tell their friends about it.

[06:54] Then that's where you get the unenix scaling.

[06:56] Also, it's where all the profit is, right?

[06:59] You don't have to worry about the churn as much because the product's so good.

[07:01] You don't have to worry about the negative reviews because the product's so good.

[07:04] You don't have to worry about customers badminton because instead they're telling their friends about how good you are.

[07:09] And this has been one of the shifts that has been most helpful for me.

[07:13] And honestly, when I look back on my own trajectory,

[07:16] how much I talk about promotion in the beginning of my career versus now I talk so much more about people in product.

[07:21] The real nuts of this is that everything that the ultra wealthy do is compounding.

[07:27] It grows with time, we're time to con an asset instead of a liability.

[07:31] And if everything you do, you have to go out and get more business, go out and get more business,

[07:35] go out and get more business, right?

[07:37] It means that it requires effort every single day, whereas if you put a lot of front end effort,

[07:41] which is the investment, which is the patience, right, to make the thing that much better in the beginning,

[07:47] then it will pay you in dividends over time and most people skip that step because they just want to make the first sale.

[07:52] They're just trying to get a customer to make a sale rather than trying to make a sale to get a customer.

[07:57] And so anyways, I hope you found this valuable.

[08:00] I cover this stuff in my book, which is basically free is 99 cents.

[08:04] It's the cheapest I could let Amazon do.

[08:07] It is called $100 million off first.

[08:08] If you want to grab it, I'm donating the 35 cents that Amazon gives you.

[08:12] It gives me, it's for you guys.

[08:15] It's everything that I've learned about how to create offers that are so good.

[08:18] People feel stupid saying no.

[08:20] I think it's the number one seller in advertising and directing marketing.

[08:22] Amazon right now.

[08:24] Love you all.

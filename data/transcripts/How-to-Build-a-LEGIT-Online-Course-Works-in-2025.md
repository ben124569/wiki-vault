[00:00] You've probably seen these make $10,000 a month and 30 day scam businesses marketing all over the internet.

[00:05] And in the same degree, you've probably seen Harvard market and say,

[00:09] you might maybe graduate from Harvard. And that's the only promise they make,

[00:13] and you can pay us $250,000 a year. And so what's the difference between this clearly scam business?

[00:17] And this incredibly legit hundred plus year old business. It turns out there's only four things.

[00:22] And I apply this strategy and building acquisition.com that only buys companies that's all we do.

[00:27] This is how we do it. There are multiple levels of legitimacy for education.

[00:31] On one side, you have Harvard. Most people don't call Harvard a scam. But they fundamentally

[00:36] sell education. And on this side, you've got a guy who tells you how to start an ATM business.

[00:42] And promises that you're going to make $100,000 a day in five seconds. They both sell education.

[00:47] And on the scam index, why is this one maxed out? And this one's zero. Number one, Harvard

[00:53] turns people down by applying for Harvard for 10 times rejected.

[00:58] If every single person who applies to work with you and the only requirements to become a customer

[01:02] of yours is a credit card and a pulse, ding ding ding, red flag number one. Most people probably

[01:07] aren't qualified to become customers. And if you define a qualified lead as somebody who has the

[01:11] highest likelihood of success with your program or service or education, then you should have

[01:17] screening metrics for who is not a good fit. It's more likely that they'll be upset.

[01:21] Leave you bad reviews. Call US scam, which you can easily avoid. Number one,

[01:25] by selling qualified customers. Only. Number two is that Harvard doesn't give income expectations.

[01:32] They don't say, become a Harvard graduate, make money tomorrow. There's a delay between one

[01:37] you start. And when you actually even graduate and get the endorsement of their brand, which to be

[01:42] fair is really what Harvard sells is the brand endorsement that you get to put on yourself. The

[01:46] second thing is that instead of giving testimonials of students on income, I graduated Harvard

[01:53] and I got my first job at $185,000 at Goldman Sachs. You don't see that anywhere on their site,

[01:58] but what they will publish is data. And this is fucking huge. If you do not track,

[02:04] your customer success metrics, meaning when someone buys what percent of them succeed at 30,

[02:10] 60, 90, 12 months. What are the averages for whatever the thing that you educate them on?

[02:16] If you track the data, then you don't add any sensationalism to what you're reporting.

[02:23] Harvard publishes what the top 20 percent with the average, with the median person gets,

[02:29] and what industries their graduates go into because that's data. They're not setting false

[02:35] expectations. And they're not saying this is what you can expect in six weeks. They're saying

[02:41] four years ago, these people started and today they graduated and this is what they got.

[02:47] The highlights that they have at Harvard are not the income, but the experience and the network

[02:52] and the relationships and the character development. Now, if you're thinking yourself,

[02:56] man, it would be harder to sell people that way. Right. But if you do it that way,

[03:01] and you only let in really good people, what do you think happens? You start to develop a brand.

[03:07] For example, I was having the discussion with Jacob, my neighbor, because he was saying he was

[03:11] considering starting a sales school. Whether he does that or not at some point in the future is a

[03:15] relevant. But I said, if you were going to start one, then you want to be legit about it.

[03:19] Because you see everybody in their mother has a sales school right now. Because they start selling

[03:23] high ticket, they immediately make 20 graded month, and they start, of course, on how to make 20

[03:27] grand a month as a high ticket closer. If you want to be legit about it, what you would do is you give

[03:32] tons of content away for free. This is pillar number three. You can monetize the education itself.

[03:38] You can sell education. But I think the smart move, and if you've consumed any of my stuff,

[03:42] is that you give away the secrets you sell the implementation. Take all the content you would normally

[03:47] sell as your course and give it all away for free. So if I were selling the ability to sell,

[03:54] then I would give away the course as content through all the different platforms I possibly could,

[04:00] and the implementation would be, let me listen to your sales calls, give you feedback in real time,

[04:06] and then monitor performance over that period so that you become a sales person.

[04:10] Pillar number four, Harvard doesn't graduate everyone. Some people fail. And the reason for that is

[04:16] because Harvard wants to maintain their brand. Because what they say is sure, Johnny graduated from

[04:22] Harvard with a one six GPA. Now he was smart enough to get in. But through the four years, we saw that

[04:28] he didn't have some of these other character traits. So I was telling Jacob, if you want to be smart about it.

[04:33] Number one, you just show the data. Number two, you would probably not accept 90% of people who

[04:39] want to be salespeople because you could immediately tell the interview, just like Harvard does,

[04:43] that you're probably not going to be a good sales person. So it's easier to find people who have

[04:47] a proclivity for sales and then just get them this much better and then endorse them. But before

[04:53] you have the endorsement, you still rank order them on who you think has succeeded the best

[04:59] and have the possibility that someone pays and does not get your endorsement because that is how

[05:04] you long term maintain the brand. And so let's play this out. How could we get 100% of people who

[05:09] graduate from my thing to be the best salespeople? First thing is to pick people who are naturally

[05:13] good at sales. Second thing is, cut out the people who are not. Third, we set expectations that

[05:19] are only based on data. And the remainder of our testimonials and stories are based on the experiences

[05:23] of people who have gone through our system or programmer implementation. I establish far more demand

[05:28] for my service than I have supply so that I can keep my prices high by generating more content

[05:34] that is better than everyone else's paid stuff. You maintain thought leadership and all they do is

[05:44] copy what you have and everyone else can then make a judgment. Wait, their free stuff isn't as good

[05:49] as your free stuff so then your paid stuff must be better than their paid stuff. That's the

[05:53] natural logic that the marketplace will always do. Let's say you did it and you had a really

[05:57] high standard and you've only been making content for let's say a year. Now if you're like wait,

[06:01] only a year. Yeah, it takes time to build big shit. So if you build it for a year and let's say you only

[06:06] got 25 people to graduate but they're all killers. Savioms, what do you think's going to happen

[06:12] to the companies that they go get jobs out? You got anymore? Now you have even more demand on both sides.

[06:19] What are you thinking is going to happen to the friends of those people who start making twice

[06:22] with the industry averages for sales guys because they're that much better. They're top 20%

[06:26] top 5% sales guys rather than just run them the mail sales guys. Their friends are going to be like

[06:30] if I'm going to make 300,000 dollars a year rather than the industry average sales guy making

[06:35] 60, I make 5 times the income. How much more valuable is this one your education? Well, we know

[06:40] hardware charges people 250,000 for therefore years. So for a year you could probably charge a lot

[06:46] because you have the data to support the fact that one you don't let everyone in. Two when people

[06:51] graduate you also have a rank order. Is that an education business? Absolutely. Is it a scam in no

[06:56] possible fucking way?

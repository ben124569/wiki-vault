[00:00] when you're trying to diagnose a situation

[00:01] if you're asking an employee,

[00:02] and I'll give you like some of the scripting around this at the end.

[00:04] It's like, hey, is it this?

[00:06] Like, I've noticed you're not doing this thing,

[00:07] is it this or this, it's conscript.

[00:09] And then you're not attacking the person,

[00:10] you're attacking the process,

[00:11] and it makes a much easier talk about.

[00:12] All right?

[00:13] If you do with human beings,

[00:15] you are going to inevitably try to influence them

[00:18] at some point to do what you would like them to do.

[00:19] And this happens within the context

[00:21] of when you go to a restaurant, you ask,

[00:22] wait, or you hope that they put the thing in for you.

[00:24] You want the food to come out the way you want it to come out.

[00:25] We have desires and demands that we make of the universe,

[00:28] and we want them to come back to us based on our preferences.

[00:31] Now, that being said, when we run a company, right?

[00:33] We deal with employees and other people

[00:35] a lot in order to organize them in a single direction

[00:38] to get them to the outcome that we desire.

[00:40] All right?

[00:40] And so I have talked about this in the past,

[00:42] but I will give you Alex's simplest framework,

[00:44] which is a triangle framework.

[00:46] What?

[00:47] What?

[00:48] What?

[00:49] What?

[00:50] What?

[00:51] It matches that, which is not calm.

[00:52] And if you don't know why I'm an MCOT,

[00:53] I suppose the I would have because there's no calm,

[00:54] it's probably going to be a couple of news.

[00:55] There's about $100 million here,

[00:56] and make these videos because I want you to make tons of money.

[00:58] And then hopefully, part with us in the future

[01:00] to get from $3 million to $10 million to $20 million, $30 million,

[01:02] and beyond.

[01:03] All right?

[01:04] Awesome.

[01:04] So let's rock and roll.

[01:06] So one of the easiest frameworks,

[01:06] and I've actually been somebody who's struggled

[01:08] at the managerial side more than kind of like the strategy

[01:10] or the marketing things like that.

[01:12] I've struggled more on the managerial side.

[01:13] So for me, frameworks here in some ways actually

[01:15] provide me more value than other frameworks

[01:17] because some of this other frameworks

[01:18] can more naturally make.

[01:19] This one did not.

[01:20] And this one is something that I have stolen ruthlessly

[01:21] from Lea Lake, because she's one who really does

[01:23] more than managing than I do.

[01:24] But I'm sharing this for the entrepreneurs

[01:25] of the world because I hope that you do not struggle as I did.

[01:28] All right?

[01:29] So if you want somebody to do something

[01:30] and they do not do it, what do you do?

[01:32] All right?

[01:32] So there are three reasons that someone will not do something.

[01:35] And part of this, two of these,

[01:36] I snagged from Andy Grove, who was the founder

[01:39] and storied CEO of Intel.

[01:42] He wrote high output management,

[01:44] which is an excellent excellent book.

[01:45] It's very, it's a little, it's a little,

[01:47] a little advanced, but it's really good.

[01:49] So recommend.

[01:49] That being said, he said there's only two reasons

[01:51] that an employee does not do what you want them to do,

[01:53] which is either they do not know how

[01:55] or they are not motivated.

[01:56] And so he said, therefore, the job of the boss

[01:58] is to motivate and to train.

[01:59] He said, if you're not training, you're not motivating,

[02:01] you're not being a good boss.

[02:02] And I thought that was wonderful.

[02:03] That being said, I came up on a circumstance in my life

[02:06] where both of those situations were not actually the case.

[02:09] There was a third scenario, which came up,

[02:11] which is why I now have a triangle for why people

[02:14] don't do stuff.

[02:15] All right?

[02:16] Number one is they don't know that you want them to do it.

[02:18] And so I'll tell you a quick story.

[02:19] So I had a sales manager that I really wanted to succeed.

[02:23] And so we hired them and they were new

[02:26] and I was super excited.

[02:28] And a few weeks in, I was like, hey, dude,

[02:30] how to conversation with some of the sales guys

[02:32] and you haven't done any call reviews.

[02:34] WTF, bro.

[02:35] And like I was like, I was unaware

[02:38] that you want me to do call reviews.

[02:39] I was like, well, I just, I mean, I just figured

[02:41] that's what you do as a sales clerk.

[02:42] No mind you.

[02:43] That is probably what they should be doing as sales director.

[02:45] But guess what I didn't do?

[02:46] I didn't tell him.

[02:46] I didn't tell him I wanted to do that.

[02:48] And so two things here with communicating expectations.

[02:51] Number one is you have to communicate them.

[02:52] Number two is you have to repeat the communication.

[02:54] Number three, you have to make sure it's documented.

[02:55] All right, which means it's in writing an ID league

[02:57] multiple places.

[02:58] And if you can, make sure that it's part of daily

[03:00] or weekly checklist or things that they report on.

[03:01] The things that you ask them to give you

[03:04] are gonna be the things that you subconsciously

[03:05] communicate are important to you.

[03:06] All right, so if you say, hey, I need you to report

[03:08] on these three metrics.

[03:09] Guess what they're gonna think is important to you.

[03:10] The three metrics, if you want something to be done,

[03:12] make sure they are reporting it to you on a weekly or daily basis.

[03:15] The faster the communication cadence

[03:17] that you have around the item or task or activity or metric,

[03:20] the more important they will demon.

[03:21] So if you meet twice a day about a specific metric,

[03:24] they will think it's very important, right?

[03:25] If you meet once a quarter and it's one line item on a slide chart,

[03:28] they will probably think it's less important.

[03:29] And if you don't report on it at all,

[03:31] and never talk about it all,

[03:32] they will definitely not think it's important

[03:33] and very, very, very high likelihood of not doing it.

[03:35] All right, so peak of the triangle here is communicate

[03:38] the expectation.

[03:39] It sounds silly, but when you think about this

[03:41] and this is why I'm sharing this framework

[03:42] is that when I have somebody who's not doing what

[03:44] I would like them to do or not,

[03:45] to hear the preferences that I have,

[03:47] I think which one of these three is,

[03:48] and so it's very helpful.

[03:49] It's also really helpful.

[03:50] When you're trying to diagnose a situation,

[03:52] if you're asking an employee

[03:53] and I'll give you like some of the scripting around this at the end,

[03:55] it's like, hey, is it this?

[03:56] Like, I've noticed you're not doing this thing,

[03:58] is it this or this, it's cosmic.

[03:59] And then you're not attacking the person

[04:00] you're attacking the process

[04:01] and it makes you much easier to talk about.

[04:02] All right, so that's number one.

[04:03] Number two is training, which is,

[04:05] do you not know how to do this thing?

[04:07] Do you not know how to do a call review?

[04:09] Well, let me tell you what a call review looks like.

[04:11] Let's do two of them together

[04:12] and we'll record the things

[04:13] that the future you can go back to it.

[04:14] This is what we're looking for.

[04:16] This is the transitions.

[04:17] This is how we take the notes

[04:18] and this is how I want you to communicate it.

[04:19] To the sales table.

[04:20] Aha.

[04:21] Right?

[04:22] And so not only did we communicate what we wanted,

[04:23] we said, hey, this is how you do it.

[04:25] And this is how I would like it to be done.

[04:27] And then finally, this is how I want you to report on it.

[04:29] To me so that I know it was done.

[04:30] Right?

[04:31] Very, very simple, but you know what?

[04:32] People don't do it.

[04:32] And being advanced is simply never not doing the basics.

[04:35] And I do have a double negative there

[04:36] because that makes you think a little harder.

[04:38] But what it means is that being advances always doing the basics.

[04:40] Like that is what being advanced is.

[04:42] Is doing the basics even while you have tremendous volume.

[04:45] Right?

[04:45] If you think about this for a second,

[04:46] when people start small businesses, they tend to grow

[04:49] because they have lots of personal interaction.

[04:50] They provide lots of service.

[04:51] They service with a smile and what happens.

[04:53] They hire some teammates.

[04:54] The service goes down.

[04:55] There's less smiles, less skill.

[04:57] And so what they did was they stopped doing the basics

[04:59] at scale.

[05:00] It's all this.

[05:00] And that's why businesses apply top.

[05:01] And so it's thinking about what are the things

[05:02] that made you successful in the beginning.

[05:04] And then how can I duplicate those at scale?

[05:05] It's always doing the basics.

[05:07] That's what it is.

[05:07] So number one, communicating the expectations,

[05:09] doing so ideally frequently and making sure

[05:11] it's measured and in writing.

[05:13] And if we do that, we have hit the peak of the pyramid.

[05:15] Number two is that we have the training side.

[05:17] Is it we should have them how to do it

[05:18] and how we want them to do it

[05:19] and how they how we want them to report on those things.

[05:21] All right, that's number two.

[05:22] Number three, the Duh Duh

[05:23] Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh

[05:23] Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh

[05:23] is incentive.

[05:25] It's motivation is do they want to do the thing?

[05:27] Because think about it.

[05:28] If I said hey dude, I need you to do X, Y and Z.

[05:30] Right?

[05:31] And you know how to do X, Y and Z.

[05:32] And you're not doing it.

[05:33] The reason might be that they are unmotivated.

[05:35] Now I'll give you the caveat here.

[05:36] Is that if someone says I've been too busy right?

[05:39] Now you can look at that as a,

[05:40] because that's usually what will happen.

[05:41] Like let's go real real real first second.

[05:43] Right?

[05:44] Theory sounds great, but let's which real world.

[05:44] They'll say I was busy because they're not known

[05:46] it's gonna be like I was not motivated right?

[05:47] So part of that could be motivation.

[05:49] Because if I said hey, if I give you 10,000 dollars

[05:51] to get this dumb out of Maro, you do it,

[05:52] they probably would.

[05:53] So I think with enough motivation they can do it.

[05:55] But that being said they might also not have the training.

[05:57] Know how to manage their schedule in a way

[05:59] to prioritize these activities.

[06:01] So you might have to train them on other components

[06:03] to make sure that it's easier for them.

[06:04] Right?

[06:05] Now that being said, when you introduce that,

[06:07] this three frameworks,

[06:08] I just love it from a conversational perspective

[06:10] and how to assess in problems.

[06:11] So if you have a teammate,

[06:12] so this is for you right now real world.

[06:14] If you have a teammate or a director or manager

[06:17] or an individual contributor who's in the company

[06:19] and they are not doing things to the extent

[06:21] that you want them to, to the quality you want them to

[06:22] at the speed that you want them to or they're just not doing it at all.

[06:25] Think about using this three, this three prong framework,

[06:27] which is like hey, Johnny, you're underperforming right now

[06:30] and it's really unlike you.

[06:31] And the reason we say that is because it also embeds a compliment,

[06:34] which is like it's not like you to suck, right?

[06:35] And so automatic,

[06:37] who are actually protecting the ego

[06:38] of the person who will still attack in the behavior.

[06:40] All right, it's really nuanced.

[06:41] I learned that one from Layla,

[06:42] just been real, but it worked really really well.

[06:43] She said, hey, it's not like you to be late for stuff.

[06:45] So what's going on, right?

[06:46] It's not like you to not get your end of week reports in,

[06:48] like what's going on, right?

[06:49] And this is where when you say the what's going on,

[06:52] it's you look through the three lenses.

[06:53] Like what's going on, is it, you didn't know

[06:55] that I wanted you to do it,

[06:55] that I not communicate it well,

[06:57] is it that you don't know how to do it,

[06:58] either in general or given your workload,

[07:00] or is it that you're not motivated to do it, right?

[07:02] Are there other priorities that are more motivating

[07:04] for you to do it?

[07:05] And so when you ask those questions,

[07:07] it gives them very clear boxes to direct their replies.

[07:10] And then you can isolate the issue

[07:12] and then you can solve it.

[07:13] And the thing is, if you have the three boxes

[07:15] and you can isolate the issue

[07:16] and then you take the actions to solve it

[07:17] and if the activity still doesn't happen,

[07:19] then you say, hey, we talked about these three boxes,

[07:21] we solved the problem.

[07:22] Like, and I can't say we haven't communicated.

[07:24] So is it just a motivation to share?

[07:25] Right?

[07:26] And then you can get into a little bit more real conversations,

[07:28] like, you know what I actually hit this job,

[07:29] and you're like, you know, like, we hate having you.

[07:30] I'm getting you know, you wouldn't say that.

[07:31] Fuck.

[07:32] You would say, you'd say, oh my gosh, that sucks.

[07:35] Let's see, and if you like the person

[07:37] that are cultural fit and they have other skills,

[07:38] and they're like, well, maybe there's another role

[07:39] in the company that would fit you.

[07:40] I would say nine times it's then,

[07:42] that's what you want to do.

[07:42] It's usually not the right call.

[07:44] Because usually if you were to hire somebody

[07:45] for this other position that you might have open the company,

[07:46] you should probably just hire the person

[07:47] that you would probably hire there.

[07:48] Because if you were to look at that person in this person

[07:50] and a tracker could have failure, does not make it,

[07:53] a high likelihood candidate.

[07:54] All right, so big picture for everyone,

[07:56] use the triangle of figuring out why people do not do

[07:59] the things that you want them to do, which is one,

[08:00] that I communicate the expectation to you,

[08:02] and by doing it with adequate importance

[08:04] to tell you how important this is to me, which is frequency

[08:06] and detail of communication, and making sure

[08:08] that it's recorded down, right?

[08:09] The training, oops, that's the side of the triangle.

[08:11] The training is that I actually show them how to do it,

[08:12] and then how to manage the other things in general

[08:14] that they are doing, so they can get all the stuff done?

[08:16] Yes, check that box, and then finally,

[08:18] are they motivated or incentivized in order to get this done?

[08:20] So, I talked about their internal motivation,

[08:22] but there's also external motivation,

[08:23] which is like, do I need to do I need to realign

[08:25] their bonus structure?

[08:26] Do I need to rely on how they're getting compensated?

[08:29] Because, for example, I asked them to do this thing,

[08:31] and they're getting compensated for four other things,

[08:32] and they don't get compensated for this extra thing.

[08:34] Well, then guess what they're probably not going to be motivated to do.

[08:36] The extra thing.

[08:37] So, we have to make sure that they are properly motivated,

[08:38] you know, internally as human beings,

[08:40] in terms of their aligned with their company,

[08:41] they see why this thing actually makes a difference.

[08:44] All right, this is my last little tidbit on this,

[08:46] is that people a lot of times just want to know why.

[08:48] Just why?

[08:49] Why am I doing this?

[08:50] And if someone understands why they're doing it,

[08:52] because otherwise, activity without purpose

[08:54] is what they do at prison camps, right?

[08:56] It's pointless labor, right?

[08:58] And so, that's the thing, it's like,

[08:59] you have to give it a point.

[09:00] You have to give it a purpose, right?

[09:01] Which is like, when you update the CRM with the notes,

[09:05] from your calls, it helps finance,

[09:07] it helps duty, in finance,

[09:08] actually have good conversations with these people,

[09:10] which helps us collect more money,

[09:11] and helps us get more people staying on track, right?

[09:14] It helps Cindy in customers' success on the onboarding,

[09:17] give them a much more personalized experience.

[09:18] We want to sell something great, right?

[09:19] Don't you want to sell something great?

[09:20] Well, if you don't put notes in,

[09:22] you're actually selling something that's worse,

[09:23] because we're gonna provide a worse experience for them, right?

[09:25] And so they're gonna get on the onboarding call,

[09:26] and we're gonna be able to have no personal,

[09:27] we're not gonna be able to know what their issues are,

[09:29] we're not gonna know what their pain's are,

[09:30] we're not gonna know what their struggling with,

[09:31] and then we can't even help them more.

[09:32] So you're gonna try and sell them this amazing solution,

[09:34] and then you're not giving us the ammo

[09:37] to actually do the things that you have just promised them.

[09:39] Oh, right?

[09:40] And the other reason we do this

[09:41] is because for us to not waste your time,

[09:43] so now I just did two benefits to the global benefit,

[09:46] which let's be real, a lot of people might care about

[09:48] if they're good people, but a lot of people do not.

[09:50] So like, but for you specifically, when you leave the notes,

[09:52] it helps us screen out candidates on the front end,

[09:55] so that we can use that data to make your call likelihood

[09:57] of close higher, so that a higher percentage of your time

[10:00] is spent closing people, and talking to people

[10:02] who have the money, who have the problems that we actually fix.

[10:04] Rather than wasting time with tire kickers

[10:06] and people who are probably not going to buy it.

[10:08] Does that make sense?

[10:09] Right, so when you do this,

[10:09] we help you sell more and make more money.

[10:11] Fair enough?

[10:12] And so you can appeal to the larger picture

[10:14] like why do we need this as an organization,

[10:17] but then also if you can ideally tie it back

[10:19] to a personal benefit to why it benefits them,

[10:21] well, I'm just don't know.

[10:22] And so just explaining that process,

[10:24] you hit all three of the triangle boxes

[10:26] and you are far more likely to get somebody

[10:27] who does the things that you're asking to do,

[10:29] so that your company can go the way that you want it to,

[10:31] so that you can make all the money in the world,

[10:33] and then wonder why you did it to begin with.

[10:34] All right, most of the nation keeping awesome months

[10:36] 11, I'll catch you guys next video.

[10:37] BAH!

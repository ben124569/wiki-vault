[00:00] Over the last five years, I've had 22 different clients and or employees try and repurpose

[00:13] our licensing material into their own business.

[00:16] And I wanted to make this video to talk about how to handle that as you inevitably grow

[00:23] a business.

[00:24] This is going to happen to you.

[00:25] So it's a matter of when not if and what I think have been some of the best strategies

[00:29] that I've used to deal with them.

[00:31] So by the way, if I have my name is Alex Morozi, I have an acquisition.com, we do about

[00:34] $85 a year in revenue.

[00:36] So today I want to talk about kind of the backlash against competition and copycats and things

[00:42] like that.

[00:43] So the biggest problem that most entrepreneurs do with, at least that I was dealing with each

[00:48] time, especially earlier on when this would happen is that I took it as such a great,

[00:53] deep personal front.

[00:55] As in, it was a true attack on my character.

[00:59] I was like, how could you be this way?

[01:01] I thought that they were scum.

[01:03] And all of the many things and thoughts that we would naturally go through.

[01:07] But I had a mentor early on in my life and she shared something with me that I've always

[01:12] it's always stuck with me.

[01:13] And she said, you'll become astonishingly good at predicting the behavior of others.

[01:17] If you always assume they will act in their own best interest.

[01:21] And that has been incredibly telling.

[01:23] And so instead of listening to what people say and believing them, if you just simply can

[01:29] think what is in this person's own best interest independent of myself or anything that

[01:34] I am basically take yourself out of the equation and think from their perspective, you will

[01:38] become astonishing good at predicting what people are going to do.

[01:42] Right?

[01:43] And so the idea, if you want to get people to do what you want them to do is that you must

[01:48] align what is in their best interest and what is in your best interest together.

[01:53] And if you can do that and accomplish that effectively, then you will be able to harness

[01:57] people's selfish nature towards a common goal, which is ultimately what a lot of business

[02:00] really is.

[02:01] Right?

[02:02] So, back to the story.

[02:05] 22 different people have tried to take our stuff, repurpose our stuff.

[02:09] And it's not just taking any repurposing it.

[02:11] It's typically also additionally them talking shit about you and usually soliciting other

[02:22] employees or current clients of yours to go with them.

[02:26] And so that then creates even more anger because it feels like someone's taking your

[02:30] stuff, et cetera.

[02:32] But this is what I can tell you has happened.

[02:35] In the few instances that I did earlier on my career where I focused a ton of time and effort

[02:40] on these people, I even once I dramatically changed my business model in response to somebody

[02:47] who was trying to solicit my best clients and my current clients and started business

[02:51] adjacent to me, the only thing that happened was that I just hurt my own business.

[02:57] And the reality is the vast majority of my customers had no idea any of this happening at

[03:02] all.

[03:03] It was all happening in my own head and I was magnifying it way out of blowing it out way

[03:09] out of proportion.

[03:10] And so if you're in this situation, these are some of the things that I think through

[03:15] or that I think with to help myself feel better about it.

[03:19] Number one, they need me.

[03:21] I do not need them.

[03:22] I am the source of the thing that they are trying to copy and therefore they will always

[03:27] be a subset of me, which means they cannot be bigger than me if the source of everything

[03:31] they have is me.

[03:32] If their source of customers is my customer base, if the source of their business model is

[03:38] my business model, they need me.

[03:39] I do not need them.

[03:41] Right?

[03:42] So that's number one.

[03:43] Number two, the type of person who operates in this way admits that they are a follower

[03:49] and not a leader, which means that they cannot lead you.

[03:52] It's a different way of saying the first one, but I think it's worth mentioning.

[03:55] Right?

[03:56] Number three, the type of person who operates in this way will always operate from place

[04:00] of scarcity.

[04:01] Right?

[04:02] They will always try and hoard and they will always be focused on you and not their

[04:07] customers.

[04:08] Right?

[04:09] So where their focus goes, where your attention goes, shoot, what is it?

[04:12] Where attention goes, money flows, that's one of my money, money sangs.

[04:17] If someone is doing that, then they are purposely telling the marketplace that you are

[04:22] the focus, not them and not their customers.

[04:26] Right?

[04:27] The thing to do, and so these are the actions to take if you are in one of these situations.

[04:31] If they get loud, you get louder about yourself.

[04:38] You get louder about your solutions.

[04:41] You get louder about your purpose about your mission.

[04:44] You never acknowledge them.

[04:46] Ever.

[04:47] Coke never acknowledges Pepsi.

[04:49] The classic never acknowledges the inferior.

[04:51] There's no point, you gain nothing.

[04:53] The only thing that is gained with what they should hope that you do is that you give

[04:59] them credit.

[05:00] Right?

[05:01] This is you speak their name into existence.

[05:04] They become more elevated and then they become on your level.

[05:08] So you can never acknowledge that they even exist.

[05:13] But if they are loud, then your course of action is to become louder about your message.

[05:21] So if you need something to motivate you, use it to motivate you, to market harder, to

[05:26] sell harder, and the saying that I like to use in our company is beat them in the field.

[05:31] All right.

[05:31] If people are talking smack in the stands, beat them in the field.

[05:35] All right.

[05:36] Look at the scoreboard.

[05:37] That's all we care about.

[05:38] All right.

[05:39] And so these are some of the things that over time I've kind of accumulated in my little

[05:43] toolkit of mental toolkit of how to deal with the haters and the people who copy

[05:48] them, the stealers and all that kind of stuff is to understand that they need me.

[05:52] I don't need them.

[05:53] That when they focus on me, they put more attention in my way.

[05:57] That the only thing that I can do in response to get louder about my thing, never acknowledge

[06:02] them.

[06:03] Right.

[06:04] And finally, just remember that the person who always gives the most to your customers

[06:08] wins, period.

[06:11] And the founder of Hubsbyt's that's something that I think is really cool and powerful.

[06:14] He said, you don't have a customer until somebody has offered them a cheaper version of

[06:19] your solution and they have chosen not to take it.

[06:22] That is when you have a customer.

[06:24] And so I think that's really telling is that if you're so confident in the value

[06:27] provide, then you shouldn't be worried about it.

[06:30] If you are worried about this person, then double down on the value that you're providing

[06:34] to your customers and then it will help you sleep better.

[06:36] Channel the nervous energy, or the angry energy that you have, not at the competitor,

[06:42] but target into the value that you're going to provide to your customers.

[06:46] All right.

[06:47] So I'm not saying, you know, I'm some saint.

[06:49] I'm saying, I've done 22.

[06:51] I like I was counting it with my GM the other day.

[06:54] We're talking about every single time somebody has tried to attack what is ours.

[06:58] Right.

[06:59] That's right.

[07:00] It takes what is yours and saying from Yellowstone the show that I like is that

[07:03] anything, if you want anything, if you have anything worth having, people are going

[07:08] to try and take it from you.

[07:10] The only way to have something that no one will ever take from you is to have something

[07:14] that no one wants.

[07:16] And if you want something that other people will have, this would be if you have

[07:19] something other people will want, then you should expect that people will try and take it

[07:23] from you.

[07:24] And you should take the fact that they are trying to take it from you as a sign of success,

[07:29] that what you were doing is the right thing because they are trying to take it from you

[07:33] because it's an indicator that what you have is desirable.

[07:36] Right.

[07:37] And that's the game.

[07:38] And the more desirable the state that you have is, the more people will try and take

[07:41] it from you.

[07:42] And so having these mental things, these mental tools in your tool belt is very useful

[07:47] as an entrepreneur and I'll leave you with one final thing.

[07:51] I think that when I look back on my life on an 80 or 90 years old, I will be ashamed of things

[07:56] that I did and actions that I took out of Malice.

[07:59] And so I think that the truest guide that we can use for what actions we should take in response

[08:06] to others is what values do I want my life to exude, what values do I want my actions to stand

[08:14] for and be in alignment with.

[08:17] And if you don't think that an action will be in alignment with the values that you would have

[08:21] when you're 80 or 90 years old and you look back on this situation, then don't do it.

[08:27] Or do the action that isn't alignment with those values.

[08:29] And a lot of times the sad part about taking the high path is that when you win, because

[08:35] right now I'm 22 for 22 in terms of people that I have defeated who have tried to take

[08:40] what is ours, you don't actually get, you don't get a victory la.

[08:46] You don't get a victory dance because when people lose to you, you can't go stand on their

[08:51] corpse and tee bag them like a video game, right?

[08:55] It doesn't work that way.

[08:56] In the real world they disappear with a whimper, they fade into obscurity, they fade

[09:04] into non-existence.

[09:06] That's what ends up happening.

[09:08] And when asked about why when they tell their own story, they'll just say they decided

[09:13] to change their mind and didn't want to pursue anymore because of XYZ reason that they

[09:17] will cite about the industry and never take ownership for why they actually sucked.

[09:24] And if you were one of those 22 people and you're watching this video, I remember you,

[09:30] but I will never acknowledge your existence.

[09:33] And so I say that because when you win, it's not that fulfilling because it's very

[09:48] rare that you're actually getting to a hot battle with somebody.

[09:51] It's all happening in your mind and most people just don't have the skills to compete with

[09:57] you if you have a business and they'll eventually just disappear.

[10:02] And it just sucks to have to deal with it.

[10:04] And the thing is, when they disappear, you'll have forgotten the exist to begin with.

[10:08] And so it's not like you get an envelope in the mail that says the person, you know, waves

[10:12] the white flag.

[10:13] They'll just move on with their lives and so will you until eventually you forget they

[10:16] exist.

[10:18] And so yeah, so that's the unfulfilling path of the victor.

[10:22] But the thing you do get to have is you get the scoreboard and you get the business and

[10:26] you get the clients and you get the impact.

[10:29] And that is really the only reward for continuing to act in the way that is aligned with

[10:33] values and providing more value to your customers is that you'll just continue to win in

[10:37] the long haul and everyone else will just shrink and compare it since you.

[10:41] So anyways, most of the nation, I make these videos a lot of people broken on which be one

[10:45] of them.

[10:46] I don't want you to take a stupid action as a result of a competitor or an ex-employer

[10:49] or an ex-client trying to siphon your clients.

[10:51] It happens.

[10:52] It's part of business.

[10:53] The fact that they're doing it shows you that you're on the right path just don't

[10:57] do anything that 85 year old you wouldn't be proud of.

[11:00] All right, lots of love.

[11:01] Keep being awesome.

[11:02] I'll catch you guys in the next video.

[11:03] Bye.

[00:00] One in every 250 businesses does a $10 million a year in sales.

[00:03] And that means that 99% of entrepreneurs never hit it.

[00:06] Every business that I started since I was 25 has crossed 10 million.

[00:09] B2B services with Jim Lont, B2C consumer products,

[00:13] with prestige labs or sub-mincome,

[00:15] and an Allen RV2B software in acquisition.com,

[00:18] which is an investment firm for all of the money that we made

[00:20] after those businesses to invest in other ones.

[00:23] It's a really confident that I can talk to the points

[00:26] of helping you go from zero to million,

[00:28] and then the $10 million and beyond.

[00:30] And so this is just a visual put this in context.

[00:32] 90% of businesses never hit a million dollars a year in sales.

[00:37] 90% doesn't look that way on Instagram,

[00:40] but this is the vast majority of businesses, right?

[00:42] Now, 9% of businesses crossed this million dollar threshold, right?

[00:47] And then only 0.4% which is 1 in 250 due to 10 million plus

[00:52] it's so rare.

[00:56] And so the nice thing is that success does leave clues.

[00:59] But wanna kind of separate this into two major categories.

[01:02] One is the entrepreneur and the others,

[01:03] the opportunity vehicle they're pursuing.

[01:05] You'll notice I said leverage rather than opportunity vehicle,

[01:08] but fundamentally leverages the difference

[01:10] in what you put in and what you get out.

[01:11] And so you wanna have the best entrepreneur

[01:14] getting the most out of what they put in.

[01:16] And so if you have those two things together,

[01:18] then you create a $10 million plus business.

[01:20] And if you've consumed any of my other content,

[01:22] then I used to talk about how entrepreneurs

[01:24] are three main things.

[01:25] You've got skills, you've got character traits,

[01:26] you've got beliefs.

[01:27] I've thought about this more and I've actually simplified it

[01:29] to one degree, which is I think you just have skills

[01:34] and beliefs.

[01:35] Character traits, if you think about this,

[01:38] you're like, I want to become patient.

[01:40] Patient is just a general term for lots of little skills.

[01:44] And so if you wanna become more patient,

[01:45] you wanna do things that patient people do.

[01:47] And that means that if I can train someone to become more patient,

[01:50] then patience is a skill.

[01:52] And so as a total side quest on this,

[01:55] what's interesting about this is that you've probably heard

[01:57] people say soft skills and like hard skills.

[01:59] In my opinion, hard skills are just skills

[02:02] that are easy to measure.

[02:04] Soft skills are just hard to measure.

[02:05] But they're both 100% skills that you can train and improve.

[02:10] And so if we say, man, I wish that guy had better people

[02:12] skills, what we mean is 100 micro skills

[02:15] that are like, I wish he would smile when someone walked

[02:17] in the room.

[02:18] Can I train someone to do that?

[02:19] Absolutely.

[02:19] If I said, hey, I wish he would greet someone

[02:22] by their first name immediately every time they walk in the door.

[02:25] Right?

[02:26] Boom, that's trainable.

[02:28] I wish someone wouldn't interrupt.

[02:29] It's like, okay, well, we can just give someone a cookie

[02:31] every time they don't interrupt someone.

[02:33] And let someone finish their statement.

[02:34] And then we train them.

[02:35] And so all of these soft skills are just soft

[02:37] because they're hard to measure.

[02:39] Does it mean that they're not skills

[02:41] or they're not important?

[02:42] And oftentimes most of us know that like within an organization,

[02:45] like the way that you gain influences the soft skills

[02:47] that are hard to measure, but incredibly important.

[02:49] So if we're talking about how do we make the highest

[02:53] leverage on entrepreneur, we want somebody who has lots

[02:55] and lots of skills.

[02:56] And really, it's about beliefs that don't limit them.

[03:00] If someone had no limits in terms of what they believe

[03:02] they could achieve, then the only thing that would limit

[03:04] them was their skills.

[03:05] But most of the times, the beliefs that we have are things

[03:09] that just decrease our potential.

[03:11] And it's not really our fault because most of the people

[03:14] that were around us when we grew up just by statistics

[03:16] were poorer than you might want to be.

[03:19] And so they told you how they see the world.

[03:21] If there's ever something that's going to be on my tombstone,

[03:23] it's this quote, which is, we question all of our beliefs,

[03:27] except for those that we truly believe,

[03:29] and those we never think to question.

[03:30] And so the things that you actually believe,

[03:33] they're so invisible to you because that's just

[03:35] your lens through which you see the world.

[03:37] Whereas when you're like, I want to debate this point,

[03:38] it's like you don't really believe that.

[03:40] You just have an opinion on it.

[03:41] Or you have some assumptions that you're willing to back.

[03:44] But the true beliefs of like, well, no one

[03:47] would be willing to pay for something like that.

[03:49] Or like that doesn't exist.

[03:50] I didn't know that was possible.

[03:52] You don't even question those things

[03:53] because they weren't even in your mind to begin with.

[03:55] It's the unknown unknowns that have things that limit us.

[03:57] The question is, how do we uplevel someone's beliefs?

[04:00] So let me give you a quick example here.

[04:02] So there was an entrepreneur that I know

[04:05] who had a fitness app.

[04:06] He was a super high level across fit games competitor.

[04:10] And he started this app and he didn't want to tell anybody

[04:12] about it because he'd never placed top three.

[04:14] He placed fourth place in multiple competitions,

[04:16] which is insane.

[04:18] But he had a belief that if he wasn't the winner,

[04:22] he didn't deserve to have an app.

[04:24] Like think about how crazy it is.

[04:25] But he didn't question that.

[04:27] That was just what he believed reality

[04:28] to be as a well of course.

[04:30] Of course I wouldn't want it.

[04:31] And so he built this app for himself

[04:33] and just the members of his gym.

[04:34] But the app was so good that people started sharing it.

[04:37] And finally, a client of his was a marketer

[04:40] and said, you need to start marketing this.

[04:42] You need to start posting about it.

[04:43] And he wouldn't post.

[04:44] And finally, she convinced him just make one post.

[04:47] And he doubled his revenue.

[04:49] He'd gone from like 20,000 a month to 100,000 dollars a month

[04:51] with his app, simply because he changed his beliefs.

[04:55] And so like fundamentally, he had all the skills.

[04:57] He was already a really good cross-fit game competitor.

[04:59] He already had the product that was really good.

[05:01] And he already had the skills to be able to market it.

[05:04] He was just choosing not to.

[05:06] Unchaining an entrepreneur is figuring out

[05:09] the reasons they give for why they can't do something.

[05:12] Those are known limits.

[05:16] Well, I can't do it because of X.

[05:18] That's the things that you know

[05:19] because you can even explain it.

[05:20] I can't do it because I'm not number one.

[05:22] I can't do it because I'm not in good enough shape.

[05:23] I can't do it because the app doesn't load well enough.

[05:26] I can't do it because it's only one platform.

[05:27] I can't do it because insert whatever.

[05:29] Now the dangerous ones are the unknown unknowns.

[05:33] All right?

[05:34] That's an M.

[05:35] My whole goal when I started my chain of gyms

[05:39] was that I wanted to be America's next gym.

[05:41] So I bought the trademark United Fitness.

[05:43] I was really proud of it.

[05:44] I had six locations.

[05:45] I joined this group of internet entrepreneurs.

[05:47] Now, my reason I think this is funny is because I was sold

[05:51] by the sales guy that there was other gym owners in the room

[05:53] and they were all doing well and doing stuff

[05:56] on the internet too.

[05:57] Got in the room.

[05:58] Not only were there no gym owners.

[06:00] There weren't even any brick and mortar business owners

[06:02] in the room.

[06:03] And so I was like, wow, this is a shock.

[06:05] And so everybody's going up there explaining

[06:07] their ads and their funnels and their upsell prices

[06:09] and all this stuff.

[06:10] And I get up there and I'm like, I own six gyms.

[06:13] It feels like, but these are the ads I run to get members

[06:14] and to my gyms.

[06:15] The thing is I gave this whole breakdown of everything

[06:17] I did and how I opened every location at full capacity

[06:19] on the first day without taking cash out of the pocket,

[06:21] all the stuff.

[06:22] And I remember the guy who's running the whole group.

[06:27] And I really looked up to this guy at that time

[06:29] because he was the first person who was way more successful

[06:32] than me that I actually had access to.

[06:33] And so I think at that point, he was doing a million dollars a month.

[06:36] And I remember thinking like, whoa, like.

[06:38] And so I go through this whole presentation.

[06:40] I'm talking as fast as I can, explaining all the stuff

[06:42] that I do.

[06:44] And he stops and he's like, Alex,

[06:48] I don't think you should be in the gym business.

[06:50] And I remember hearing that.

[06:52] It was like time slow down.

[06:53] Because I felt like you're like punch me in the gut

[06:54] because this was like my whole plan,

[06:55] my whole dream, this is what I was going towards.

[06:58] But I like pause and just like hurt him out

[07:00] and he said, you have a level 10 skill set

[07:03] and a level two opportunity.

[07:05] I don't think you should be running gyms.

[07:06] I think you should be teaching people how to do

[07:07] what you just walk through.

[07:09] And I had to believe and I still do that.

[07:12] If someone's further along in the game of business,

[07:15] you always have things that you can learn from them.

[07:17] And if I paid to be in this room,

[07:18] if I don't take the advice,

[07:19] it's the closest thing to me burning all the money

[07:21] that I paid to be here.

[07:22] And so when he told me that to me, that was an unknown unknown.

[07:27] I didn't know that there was another opportunity vehicle

[07:30] outside of me just owning gyms.

[07:31] Like I didn't know it was possible.

[07:33] So I hadn't thought like, I didn't know how franchise just worked.

[07:36] I didn't know how licensing worked.

[07:37] I didn't know how any of, I didn't know how to be

[07:39] to be national, any of that stuff worked.

[07:42] Now there were sub-skills that I would have to learn

[07:43] in order to enable it.

[07:44] But I couldn't even start on that skill path

[07:46] or see the deficiency of skills that I had

[07:48] because that didn't even think I could pursue it.

[07:50] And so these are the ones that, in my opinion,

[07:53] are the most powerful to overcome.

[07:55] It's the things that you didn't know were possible.

[07:57] I'll give you a different example.

[07:58] In chain of fairies, which is one of our portfolio companies,

[08:00] amazing business.

[08:02] Super successful single location in the founder had an agency

[08:05] when he approached me saying,

[08:06] like, hey, I want to do what you did with Jim launch

[08:08] but with photography studios.

[08:09] And so we talked and we talked and we talked

[08:11] and his model was so good.

[08:12] I was like, I don't know, man.

[08:14] I think one of the things that I didn't have with Jim launch

[08:16] is that I couldn't control delivery with photography

[08:19] who can control delivery.

[08:20] And so that means that we could actually centralize

[08:22] a lot of stuff.

[08:23] I was like, what if we just owned all of them

[08:25] with a hybrid model?

[08:27] We actually took the agency from what it was doing,

[08:29] which for most people watching this

[08:30] would be a very good business for you to zero,

[08:33] to start this next thing.

[08:34] We had such good rapport that he's like,

[08:37] if you really think so and we walked through the math,

[08:39] he was like, I mean, this makes sense

[08:40] but I'm gonna kill something that makes a lot of money.

[08:43] It's like, yeah, but I think it's gonna be

[08:45] for something that's gonna make way more.

[08:46] And then for the next six months,

[08:48] we worked and tweaked the original model

[08:51] to get this new model off the ground.

[08:53] And 30 months later, that business was two

[08:56] and a half a million a month with 30 plus locations

[08:58] because I said, let's just own it all.

[09:00] He didn't think that that was a model that was really available

[09:03] and then as soon as we made that switch,

[09:06] everything took off.

[09:07] Even in my own personal story,

[09:08] when I switched from having my gyms

[09:10] to doing a done for you fly around the country model,

[09:13] that took the same skills that I had as an entrepreneur

[09:16] and put them in a better vehicle.

[09:18] And then even from doing the gym turner business for two years,

[09:21] I accidentally fell into the licensing model

[09:24] because I didn't wanna fly out.

[09:25] Somebody asked me if I could just show them

[09:27] all the stuff that I did so they could do it for themselves

[09:29] and then at that point, he bought it

[09:31] and it was all margin and I was like, holy cow,

[09:34] this isn't saying.

[09:35] That's when everything took off like a rocket.

[09:36] So I had my brick and mortar gyms

[09:38] and then I scaled to a done for you turn around business

[09:40] and then I scaled to life and zinc

[09:42] and each of those were higher leverage opportunities

[09:44] and it was because I didn't know as possible.

[09:47] And so what's I learned that it was possible

[09:49] that unlocked all of the potential value that my skills could have

[09:53] because fundamentally, in every one of those examples,

[09:55] I knew how to do the same stuff.

[09:56] I knew you had a market and sell for a local gym.

[09:58] I knew you had to build them more profitably,

[10:00] create the workouts, the meal plans,

[10:01] all that kind of stuff that got people results.

[10:03] That's what I knew how to do.

[10:05] But at each level, when I went from gyms to turn around

[10:12] the leverage increased from each of these things

[10:16] and so the same skill set put into a new bucket

[10:18] or a new vehicle unlocked huge value.

[10:21] And that's why a lot of entrepreneurs

[10:23] don't get past a millionaire.

[10:25] You can get two, 10 millionths

[10:26] that they're in the wrong vehicle.

[10:27] So I talk about leverage a lot

[10:29] and it's actually one of the core concepts in our logo

[10:31] so we have a supply demand curve

[10:32] and then we have a full Chrome

[10:34] which is the acquisition knock-on logo

[10:35] and it's because it's core to everything we do.

[10:37] If you think about leverage,

[10:39] you've ever heard our community as you said,

[10:41] give me a long enough lever

[10:42] and I can move the world.

[10:44] This is our lever and we'll put our little hand here,

[10:48] that's my arm.

[10:49] If we grab the lever here,

[10:53] we have the most leverage on something that is here.

[10:56] If we grab the lever here,

[10:58] we still have the most leverage on something here

[11:00] but we have less leverage overall

[11:02] compared to how much we have

[11:04] on this side.

[11:04] And the main difference here is

[11:07] how much force goes up the other side.

[11:09] All right, and so leverage is the difference

[11:11] between what you put in and what you get out.

[11:15] That's it.

[11:16] So let me give you an example in the real world.

[11:17] If you are really skilled at cold calling,

[11:20] skill itself is leverage

[11:22] because if somebody who doesn't have the skill

[11:24] makes a hundred phone calls, that's their input

[11:27] and somebody who does have the skill

[11:28] puts a hundred calls down

[11:30] and the guy who doesn't have the skill

[11:32] gets zero appointment set

[11:34] and the guy who's amazing at it gets 10 appointment set.

[11:38] He has, well let's just say the first guy

[11:39] had one for sake of math.

[11:41] He has 10 times the leverage on that skill

[11:44] compared to the newbie,

[11:45] getting an acquiring skills gives you more leverage

[11:48] because it gets you more for what you put in.

[11:50] And so if you're more skilled entrepreneur,

[11:52] being a skilled entrepreneur is a big bucket

[11:55] for hundreds of smaller skills underneath of it

[11:58] because it means that you know how to prioritize

[11:59] what to do next.

[12:00] And so one of my favorite quotes about leverage

[12:01] comes from Warren Buffett, Uncle Warren.

[12:03] He and one of his closest friends graduated

[12:05] Columbia Business School at the same time.

[12:06] Same year and he said that guy was smarter

[12:08] and harder working than him.

[12:09] Now they then went their separate ways,

[12:11] Lauren ended up getting into investing with Ben Graham

[12:13] and his friend goes into the steel business

[12:15] because that was back in the day

[12:16] when like American steel was like a thing

[12:18] which it really no longer is.

[12:19] What he learned from that experience is that he fast forward

[12:22] 34, 50 years and he said his friend did okay

[12:26] and he said, mind you, this is a guy

[12:27] who was smarter and harder working than him.

[12:29] He said he did okay, he did pretty well

[12:32] but not close to what Warren did.

[12:34] And he said his biggest lesson from that

[12:35] was it's not about hard you row, it's about what Boeron.

[12:39] And I love that because it really encompasses

[12:42] the concept of leverage which is Warren got more out

[12:46] for what he put in than his buddy in the steel business

[12:50] because the steel business had a lot of headwinds.

[12:52] A lot of things going against them.

[12:53] They had globalization started happening yet another

[12:56] imported steel that was cheaper from China, blah, blah, blah

[12:58] and so those forces he had to roll harder against the wind

[13:02] than Warren did while riding one of the best growth curves

[13:07] of the U.S. economy overall.

[13:09] And so he got higher returns.

[13:10] And so over my career, I make more now than I did before

[13:15] because I've moved further back along this lever.

[13:18] So I have more leverage now on what I put in

[13:21] than what I did before.

[13:22] When I was selling one-on-one in person

[13:24] and I was doing 20 consults a day,

[13:26] I was working more hours probably than I do now.

[13:29] But I get so much more for what I put in.

[13:31] So I'm going to show you two triangles

[13:33] that show increasing amounts of leverage.

[13:36] Now one of these I've stolen ruthlessly

[13:38] from the Val-Ravicon.

[13:40] And so he talks about the four types of leverage.

[13:42] I've renamed them so they're seasoned.

[13:43] It's mostly just so I remember them more easily.

[13:46] But you've got collaboration which just means other people

[13:48] working for you.

[13:50] Then you've got capital which means other people work for you

[13:53] and gave you the fruit of their work

[13:55] so that you can invest it on their behalf.

[13:56] So for example, if I get people to give me a billion dollars

[13:59] which I could do just raise the money

[14:00] and then I invest that money and I say I get 20% of the gain,

[14:04] I didn't have to work all the time to make a billion dollars

[14:06] but I still get 20% of it.

[14:08] Right?

[14:09] That's the idea of using leverage of other people's money.

[14:11] So capital, so you've got collaboration, capital,

[14:14] you've got code and content.

[14:16] If I'm a genius coder and I could build one piece of software,

[14:19] I can build it once and people a million people

[14:21] can use that same piece of software.

[14:23] With content, Joe Rogan can make one podcast episode

[14:27] and millions of people can listen to it.

[14:29] And so he gets more for what he puts in.

[14:32] So if you think about each of these things,

[14:33] it's like you have the influence on someone else.

[14:36] I trade me selling for 40 hours a week

[14:38] to me managing a salesman for two hours

[14:40] who then sells for 40 hours a week.

[14:42] Or higher leverage, I spend a week

[14:46] or two weeks recruiting the best sales recruiter

[14:49] and then I do that one time in my life for two weeks

[14:52] and then that sales recruiter works 40 hours a week

[14:54] to get new salespeople in every single week on my behalf

[14:57] and then those salespeople on my behalf

[14:59] then sell every single day.

[15:01] And so I did two weeks of work

[15:02] for 100 salespeople over the lifetime of that one hire.

[15:06] More leverage, I get more for what I put in.

[15:08] Compare that to me taking 20 cons all today.

[15:10] Higher leverage skill, but same concept done at scale.

[15:13] Capital we went over, code content,

[15:15] those are the four types of leverage.

[15:17] Now, this is where this gets interesting

[15:19] because once I learned this,

[15:20] I was able to put words to what I kind of knew intrinsically

[15:24] and I can now explain it.

[15:25] So if you look at my career trajectory,

[15:29] see if I can draw a triangle here.

[15:33] All right.

[15:33] And one of the key points here is that

[15:35] you can actually just max out one of these things.

[15:37] So you don't need to have all four.

[15:39] Now if you have all four cool,

[15:40] but if you think about what leverage is in general,

[15:42] it's just you get more for what you put in.

[15:44] And so if you get a thousandx on any of these,

[15:46] it's still a thousandx.

[15:47] So somebody can just be an amazing private equity guy

[15:49] who are amazing at raising money and become a billionaire.

[15:51] They don't need to do any of these other things.

[15:53] So we could be amazing at galvanizing people

[15:56] and creating movements and they wouldn't need any of these other things.

[15:59] If someone's amazing at writing software,

[16:01] they don't need anyone else's capital

[16:02] and the software does the collaboration on the rehab.

[16:05] And so all of these things,

[16:07] even though they're structured like this,

[16:08] you don't have to have all of them.

[16:09] If you do have all of them,

[16:11] well, you look at Facebook that is code about content.

[16:14] He raised other people's money and he has people working for him.

[16:16] But let me show you how this changed for me.

[16:18] So in the beginning, it was dark.

[16:21] I was an employee, right?

[16:24] And I made four figures a month.

[16:28] Then I became self-employed.

[16:29] I gained a little bit of leverage just over my own time.

[16:32] So I went from having someone else control my time

[16:34] to me controlling my time, which was leverage.

[16:36] I got more for what I put it.

[16:38] And it's a five-figure's month, right?

[16:40] Then I went to employing other people, right?

[16:43] Which is then I would say the first level

[16:45] is me now having the first level of leverage.

[16:47] So it's a six-figure's a month, right?

[16:49] And this is right as I, I would say first one,

[16:51] I started my gyms that I had multiple gyms.

[16:53] And then when I transitioned that to turn around,

[16:54] I still stayed at six figures a month.

[16:56] But fundamentally, it's because I actually didn't change leverage.

[16:58] I changed how I was structuring it,

[16:59] but fundamentally, it was people doing the same work.

[17:03] So this was both me being a gym owner with six locations

[17:06] and me doing the turnaround business with other people.

[17:11] You're like, how do you go from six figures a month,

[17:12] seven figures a month?

[17:14] Then we started licensing.

[17:17] Now what is that?

[17:19] I made content fundamentally.

[17:21] And then I made it once.

[17:23] And then many people could have access to it.

[17:25] And so when I did that, I went to seven figures a month.

[17:29] Now the question is, how do I get from seven figures a month

[17:32] to a figures a month?

[17:33] Because that's what we have at acquisition.com.

[17:34] What did I add into it?

[17:37] Capital.

[17:38] So now we buy into companies that have other people working for them.

[17:41] I use content to attract it as businesses.

[17:44] Now I don't have any code right now.

[17:45] I have one software investment, maybe two, I think.

[17:48] That are major investments.

[17:49] But the rest of myself really, if we're talking about it,

[17:51] is that I made content.

[17:53] I had capital from the things I had done before.

[17:55] And we are at the ability to get other people to help us

[17:57] get our get to our goals.

[17:59] And so this is acquisition.com.

[18:03] And that's a figures a month.

[18:05] Now, will I need to do to get to nine figures a month?

[18:08] I may just need to add time to the existing thing

[18:10] that I'm doing.

[18:11] Key point is that leverage is about getting more

[18:14] for what you put in.

[18:15] People who move faster in life don't actually move faster.

[18:18] They get more for their inputs.

[18:19] They get more for every step.

[18:20] I'm not like frenetically moving to move faster.

[18:23] You just get more out of every move.

[18:26] And so that means that if you're getting more out of every move,

[18:28] it's a function of time.

[18:30] And so if I had, for example, maybe some code

[18:34] that was implemented within everything

[18:35] that I do at acquisition.com,

[18:37] I might be able to get to nine figures a month

[18:39] faster than I currently am.

[18:41] But I feel confident with these three,

[18:44] that we'll get to nine figures a month eventually.

[18:47] And so you might say Alex, that might be a limiting belief.

[18:50] They might be.

[18:51] But that's kind of how I'm choosing to play it.

[18:53] And so, and let me reverse the clock here.

[18:56] If I had just kept my gyms from the time I started my gyms

[19:00] until now, I might have a hundred locations.

[19:04] And I might also already be doing nine figures.

[19:07] No, I probably would be doing eight figures a month

[19:09] from the gyms.

[19:10] And so we're like, well, wait a second.

[19:12] So was it the best move?

[19:14] I can't go back and replay time.

[19:15] I don't know.

[19:16] But that's where, to me, this is why the game gets interesting,

[19:19] is that every time you switch vehicles,

[19:21] you start at zero again.

[19:23] So the pace that the leverage affords you for each step,

[19:26] you take has to be disproportionate,

[19:28] because you're four of a business,

[19:30] you'll typically grow more than year one of a new business.

[19:33] And so that's where doing the same thing

[19:35] for a longer and longer period of time,

[19:37] you still get more leverage.

[19:38] The guy who owns Panda Express

[19:40] opened 600 new locations this year,

[19:43] because he has done this,

[19:45] because now he has enough capital,

[19:47] he has enough collaboration that he doesn't do any content.

[19:50] And he doesn't have any code, right?

[19:52] But he has these two at such a high degree

[19:55] that when he adds 600 locations,

[19:58] and each location does $3 million a year, right?

[20:01] Or it might even be a month.

[20:02] I don't know.

[20:03] And just to give you context,

[20:04] Panda Express in 2021 to 3.7 billion

[20:08] top-line sales, and he owns 100% of it,

[20:12] no outside investors with his wife, Peggy.

[20:15] And they took home 27% net margins

[20:18] on brick and mortar food.

[20:20] All right, so let's do the math.

[20:22] That's 935 million in income.

[20:25] Like, that was his distributions from owning this thing.

[20:28] Now if you're like, wait,

[20:29] did he pay taxes on it?

[20:30] Sure, didn't, why?

[20:31] Because he owns all the land in the dirt

[20:33] for most of the locations that he had that are freestanding.

[20:34] So he depreciated all of that against his income.

[20:37] So he took all of that tax-free.

[20:39] So point being, he did this, and you're like,

[20:42] well, how did you do it?

[20:43] He's been making chicken and orange chicken

[20:45] and kung-pow chicken for 45 years.

[20:49] So even though he might not have been

[20:50] in the highest leverage vehicle,

[20:53] he was able to stick with that vehicle

[20:55] for 45 years, and being able to stick with something

[20:58] for 45 years makes it really hard to suck.

[21:02] And when you do that, you start unlocking multipliers

[21:05] on the leverage you have,

[21:07] rather than thinking I need more leverage

[21:09] in terms of more types of leverage,

[21:10] maybe you just need more of the one

[21:12] that you've been using since you started with.

[21:14] Remember, I gave the little phone call example

[21:15] of like two people doing the same thing,

[21:17] one person has more leverage?

[21:18] Well, each of these things are big buckets

[21:21] with many smaller skills underneath of it.

[21:23] So collaboration is, I have to know how to recruit talent.

[21:27] I have to know how to recognize talent.

[21:28] I have to know how to onboard.

[21:29] I have to know how to train.

[21:31] I have to know how to manage.

[21:32] I have to know how to grow talent.

[21:35] And I have to know how to run meetings.

[21:37] And I have to know how to have one on once.

[21:38] And I have to, like you're saying here,

[21:40] like all of those micro skills chunk off to collaboration.

[21:44] For capital, it's like you have to be good at math.

[21:46] Being bad at math is probably not,

[21:48] like the be tough to race capital

[21:50] if you really can't do math.

[21:51] It's like, okay, well that's a skill you need to know.

[21:53] Well, what else do you need to know?

[21:54] It's like, well, you need to be able to reach out

[21:56] to people and get rejected.

[21:57] Why?

[21:58] Because when you try and race capital,

[21:59] you get rejected a lot more times than you get checks.

[22:02] Right?

[22:02] From there, it's like you also probably have

[22:04] an understanding of legal

[22:05] because you have to learn how to set up a fun structure.

[22:07] You also have to know how to negotiate

[22:08] because every single person writes your check

[22:10] is gonna want different terms.

[22:11] You then have to structure it in a way

[22:13] and negotiate so that you can get

[22:14] mutually beneficial terms for both parties.

[22:16] So these are all other skills that go into racing capital.

[22:20] Right?

[22:20] Making content, it's like you have to understand the different platforms.

[22:22] You have to understand how to sell stories.

[22:23] You have to understand how to have,

[22:26] I mean, an even understanding here is just like,

[22:27] you might even have to just do the work to have credibility

[22:30] to make the content about whatever you're making it on.

[22:31] And you know what?

[22:32] I'm gonna side quests this real quick.

[22:33] A lot of people may content right now

[22:35] and they're trying to hit it big.

[22:37] But what they do is like in my opinion,

[22:39] you've got entertainers and you've got educators.

[22:43] The thing is is that a lot of people who have

[22:44] and done shit are trying to educate on things

[22:46] they haven't done and so they have no credibility.

[22:49] And so the thing is is that like the reason

[22:51] Mr. Beast was able to get so big

[22:52] is that when he was 15 years old,

[22:54] he wasn't teaching people about business.

[22:55] He was being funny and being cool.

[22:58] People were like, oh, I wanna be like him

[23:00] and so then they say, oh, I'm gonna educate people

[23:01] on house flipping, but they're 22 years old

[23:05] and they have flipped them any houses.

[23:07] And so they have no credibility in their content.

[23:09] And so in my opinion when you're doing this content thing

[23:12] if you're gonna do it, then make sure

[23:14] that you have the backing of experience and proof

[23:16] because then I promise you like when you get shit on

[23:19] from the public because you will

[23:20] because they don't know who you are

[23:22] and most people are lying, you'll be able to know

[23:24] that what you're saying is true because you lived it.

[23:26] And so then you won't second guess yourself.

[23:28] The people who like tank and self-employed

[23:30] because they're like they can't handle the heat

[23:32] is because on some level they believe it.

[23:34] So if you wanna be an educator, then I think that the middle

[23:38] ground, the pre-education stage is the documentation stage

[23:41] where you just say this is what I'm doing now, check it out.

[23:43] Like right now I can't educate really on nine figures,

[23:46] not really, excuse me, I can't educate on nine figures a month.

[23:48] Have them been there.

[23:49] And over the eighth of a month is,

[23:50] don't know how to get to nine figures a month.

[23:52] I have my theory which is that I just have to add time

[23:54] to this equation.

[23:55] The math spells that out.

[23:58] But I just got it, wait, once I get there,

[24:00] then I can talk about how to build a billion-dollar portfolio.

[24:02] And you can imagine how my content might change, right?

[24:05] And so if you're making six figures a year

[24:07] and trying to talk about how to make seven,

[24:09] you've never made seven, then you're full of shit.

[24:11] And you write Felicia, get the hate that you do, right?

[24:14] And so these are skills that you have to learn

[24:17] how to acquire two-mate content.

[24:19] And to make code, you have to learn how to go code.

[24:22] And this is how little I know about coding.

[24:24] This is it.

[24:25] So I would even give you examples of micro-skills.

[24:28] But like you have to learn HTML and JavaScript

[24:31] and Ruby and Python.

[24:33] It's about it.

[24:33] It's all I know.

[24:35] And data architecture.

[24:37] And yep, that's it.

[24:40] It's all I got.

[24:42] It's that you have to learn these smaller skills

[24:44] to then say I'm very excellent at code

[24:47] so that I can then have more leverage on the things

[24:49] that I do.

[24:50] And then you can walk yourself up this income ladder

[24:53] with more leverage, right?

[24:55] And again, leverage is about speed.

[24:57] Any of these vehicles that I had done,

[24:59] if I had done it for 45 years, like Mr. Panda,

[25:03] you could get there because my end on input is so high.

[25:08] If I spent 45 years doing something,

[25:10] I might not have the strongest arm.

[25:13] But I've done it 45 times more.

[25:16] So I still get more out than the guy that's over here

[25:18] that does it two times.

[25:20] This is where strategy comes into play

[25:22] is making sure that you're picking the right vehicle.

[25:24] Chris, for example, made last money in the first nine months

[25:28] scaling a chin at fairies, they needed before.

[25:32] But at month 10, he matched it.

[25:34] At month 24, it was like so small

[25:37] and comparison that didn't even matter.

[25:39] But I can tell you this.

[25:41] Really easy to say this, really hard to do that.

[25:44] For nine months, each shit and feel like you're losing

[25:48] and always knowing that you could always go back

[25:50] and that's the hard part.

[25:51] Go back to what you were doing before

[25:52] that was comfortable in made you X versus staying the path.

[25:57] And I can tell you, it was hard for me.

[25:58] I mean, my team knows that.

[25:59] Like going for making what I was making a gym watch

[26:02] to doing acquisition.com the first year,

[26:05] I was like this sucks.

[26:07] Like I'm used to being able to run any personal expense

[26:09] with a business and not even blank.

[26:11] Like I actually have to look at cash flow.

[26:12] All right.

[26:14] And so these are things that you have to take in.

[26:16] But I do believe genuinely,

[26:17] your 10 of acquisition.com,

[26:19] I think is bigger than your 15 of gym watch.

[26:22] To make the apples to apples comparison.

[26:23] Because the thing is that you actually never get an apples

[26:25] to apples comparison because you can go back in time.

[26:27] And so you have to look at what your 10 of one business is

[26:29] compared to your three of another.

[26:31] And so if you're at your sixth year,

[26:33] maybe you should just keep riding it out

[26:35] because whatever you started with is the thing

[26:37] that you have the longest lever on number of times

[26:40] that you got reps in.

[26:41] And people want to change industries

[26:42] and I'll give you a little tidbit from Wycommonator.

[26:44] One is they don't take solo founders as a side net.

[26:47] Now mind you, they're only interested in billion dollar companies.

[26:49] So if that's not you, then you could totally be a single founder.

[26:51] But it's just harder to be successful

[26:53] with one person's skills versus three.

[26:56] The second interesting thing that they have,

[26:57] they have many things they select for,

[26:59] but one of them is industry experience.

[27:01] And so if someone says,

[27:02] hey, I want to get into this industry.

[27:04] If you don't have any experience in that industry,

[27:06] and then second to that is personal experience,

[27:08] like you've suffered from whatever problem you're trying to solve,

[27:12] then they're not interested.

[27:13] And so you might have six years of experience

[27:17] in the mortgage business.

[27:18] I wouldn't recommend getting in a weight loss.

[27:20] I would say maybe you take a half pivot

[27:22] so you're in the same industry

[27:23] because it's so hard to make up those six years.

[27:25] This hopefully gives you more nuanced view

[27:28] to making the right picks to making the most money.

[27:32] By the way, if you guys like the whiteboard

[27:33] and me drawing on with markers,

[27:35] this is a throwback to what I used to do.

[27:37] I finally got another board because I love these things.

[27:42] But if you like this style, like let me know,

[27:44] I love this style, but I just try and do the things that

[27:47] the data suggests that you like the most.

[27:49] I'll do what you guys want so that I can hopefully

[27:51] transfer the skills that I have to you faster.

[27:54] I said earlier that the unknown unknowns

[27:56] are the most expensive thing in business, right?

[27:58] Because you don't know what you don't know.

[27:59] And so I want to give you a quantifiable example.

[28:01] I remember the first time I heard this it changed my life.

[28:03] And so it was actually a whiteboard just like this.

[28:05] So you get to like, I'm getting goosebumps.

[28:07] You'll have the same experience I did.

[28:09] So guy was on stage and gave this whole presentation

[28:11] about learning skills and about how you have to

[28:13] invest in yourself to get better, right?

[28:15] And he called somebody in the audience and he said,

[28:18] man, and as he's saying this, he's doing what I'm doing.

[28:21] He says, man, how much money do you make right now?

[28:24] Per year.

[28:24] She stood up and she said $50,000 a year.

[28:26] And he's like, OK.

[28:28] So what would be the main reason that you wouldn't

[28:31] want to invest today?

[28:32] So he was closing.

[28:32] This is actually a close.

[28:33] But as a side note, I think the reason I like sale so much

[28:36] is because many of the obstacles overcomes that you learn

[28:39] to overcome are actually self bullshit.

[28:41] And so in a way like learning how to sell other people,

[28:44] for me, was learning how to sell myself.

[28:47] Because I had so much head trash of why it couldn't do things,

[28:49] or why it shouldn't start now, or why I had to think about

[28:52] or why I needed permission from someone else,

[28:53] or why the universal stack to get me to be successful.

[28:56] Like these are all things that I had to learn the arguments

[28:58] against to convince myself to do stuff.

[29:00] And so he asked the lady, he says, OK.

[29:03] So what would make you not want to invest in this?

[29:05] And she says, well, I don't have the money.

[29:10] And he said, well, it's probably

[29:12] don't have the money because you've been paying a really

[29:14] expensive bill every single year.

[29:16] And she's like, what do you mean?

[29:18] He's like, well, right now, you've been paying $950,000 a year.

[29:25] Not knowing how to make a million dollars.

[29:27] He said, this is the cost of your ignorance.

[29:34] This is the debt that you carry for the rest of your life

[29:38] until you learn how to make a million dollars.

[29:41] And so the reason I'm so heavy on learning skills

[29:45] and becoming educated is that right now,

[29:47] I'm paying down ignorance debt.

[29:49] I'm 10 down $950 million a year, not knowing how to make a billion.

[29:55] So debt, I'm paying.

[29:56] We all pay ignorance debt.

[29:58] And so the idea is how quickly cannot pay this down

[30:01] so that I can have more cash flow to continue to pay this down

[30:04] faster.

[30:05] Now, strategy, like I said earlier,

[30:07] is about how you allocate limited resources

[30:10] against unlimited options.

[30:11] That's the fancy word of just saying prioritizing.

[30:14] And so right now, you have limited resources.

[30:17] You have time and you have money.

[30:19] Now, you might have more time than money,

[30:21] but either way, you have some limit on what you have.

[30:24] And so for you to move faster,

[30:25] you have to identify prioritize the thing

[30:28] that you're gonna allocate your time and money towards.

[30:30] And you want the thing that gets you the most for it.

[30:32] Remember the input output that we had over the leverage?

[30:35] So you want the thing that gives you the most leverage.

[30:37] Now, one of the tough parts about reality

[30:39] is that the things that you have access to

[30:42] when you have fewer resources are less than the things

[30:44] that you have access to when you have more resources.

[30:46] Like, Mr. Panda can go buy a building for a billion dollars

[30:51] and flip it for $2 billion in a year or two

[30:54] and make a billion dollars.

[30:56] Because he has more resources than you do.

[30:58] And you can't do that, right?

[30:59] Not right now.

[31:01] But you do have things that could get you there,

[31:04] which is why Charlie Munger talked about how to do whatever you can do.

[31:07] Big Barrow Steel, Eat, Ramen, walk with your lunch pill,

[31:10] both directions, do whatever you have to do

[31:11] to make your first 100,000.

[31:13] Because he understands,

[31:14] I mind you're him saying 100,000 is probably like

[31:15] a million dollars today.

[31:16] Because he knows that once you get that,

[31:18] you can actually get a little bit more leverage

[31:20] in terms you get way more for what you put in

[31:22] because you can't only put your time in

[31:24] because it's so limited in terms of how much you can do.

[31:26] All right.

[31:27] So this is why I talk about having investing in the SME 500,

[31:34] more than the SMP 500.

[31:36] So if you don't know this, it's standard in poor 500 companies

[31:38] on the stock exchange.

[31:40] It's probably like the gold standard index

[31:42] that we track how the US economy's doing.

[31:43] It's a really just the stock market in general's doing.

[31:45] All right.

[31:46] And so if you've dollar cost average in the SMP 500,

[31:48] you get nine to 10% a year for life.

[31:51] Or at least that's what it's done historically.

[31:52] So the question is, rather than investing in this,

[31:57] we just have to say, can we do anything

[31:58] that gets us more than 10% back?

[32:01] Great.

[32:02] Now we can quantify this.

[32:03] And so if I have, let's say $1,000, right?

[32:08] And here's the magic of this.

[32:09] Is that when you invest $1,000 into the SMP,

[32:12] you have nothing else that you add to that thousand.

[32:16] You can't juice the thousand.

[32:18] You buy in the same valuation

[32:19] that every other investor buys in it.

[32:21] And so I'll tell you one of the magic

[32:22] so I'm gonna open up the curtain here for a second.

[32:24] One of the magic of what we do at Acquisitor.com

[32:26] is that we pair capital with no how.

[32:28] And so we can buy a company at a decent valuation

[32:33] and have a big margin of safety

[32:34] because of our skill set.

[32:36] So we know that we can triple or 10x the business

[32:39] when we invest in it.

[32:40] So we don't have to pick amazingly.

[32:42] Like Warren Buffett, the better picker, always will be

[32:44] than I am, right?

[32:45] At picking businesses.

[32:46] But Warren Buffett doesn't work in the business, right?

[32:49] So that's my advantage over Warren Buffett right now.

[32:51] My dude, he has way more advantages over me.

[32:54] All right, made 90 billion on his apple trade.

[32:56] But, but this is the game that I'm supposed to play right now

[33:00] because here's the leverage that I have on him.

[33:03] I have 60 more years of life than he does.

[33:07] He's 93, I'm 33.

[33:09] So I have a lot more of these left on my move set.

[33:13] Okay?

[33:13] Now, we have our $1,000.

[33:15] We get 10% meaning at the end of the year

[33:17] we're at $1,100 roughly.

[33:20] Okay, or let's say you buy a sales training course.

[33:24] They teach you how to sell

[33:25] and you get implementation from that

[33:27] where they review some of your calls

[33:28] so that you can improve.

[33:30] And all of a sudden you take your income from 40,000 year

[33:34] to 220,000 year.

[33:37] Okay, what does that mean?

[33:38] I mean, is that that thousand think about this return.

[33:41] All right, in scenario one, you have $1,100.

[33:43] In scenario two, and here's the crazy part,

[33:46] you have an extra 180,000.

[33:51] All right, so compare this to that.

[33:54] But here's the crazy part.

[33:55] This is every year.

[33:58] Because once you have the skill,

[34:01] you only get better from there.

[34:02] And so one of the things my dad used to tell me

[34:04] that when I was growing up was that

[34:07] he was always really big on education.

[34:08] Because he came here $1,000 didn't speak the language.

[34:10] And he learned English.

[34:11] Like that was a skill.

[34:12] He didn't have.

[34:13] Like we'd take so many skills for granted.

[34:14] Like the man didn't, he couldn't even speak the language

[34:16] of the country, right?

[34:17] In the thousand bucks and he was able to take his medical

[34:20] school education and apply here in the US

[34:23] because he fled during the revolution in Iran.

[34:26] And he said, the one thing that no government can take

[34:29] from you and no wife can still from you in a divorce.

[34:32] And you can't get sued out of.

[34:35] Is your education?

[34:37] They can't take it from you.

[34:38] And he had relatives who actually really well off

[34:42] who actually owned the lottery in Iran.

[34:44] So you get it was a private company.

[34:45] So they made a lot of money.

[34:47] But they were like second and third generation

[34:49] and they had it learned the skills.

[34:50] And so when they fled during the revolution,

[34:52] they could only take what they could carry

[34:54] because all of their assets got seized by the government.

[34:57] And they never were able to go back to what they had

[35:00] because they didn't have the skills.

[35:02] Because the government could take their assets.

[35:04] But they didn't have the education, right?

[35:07] And the guys you were who were businessmen from Iran,

[35:09] straight to LA became businessmen in LA

[35:12] and crushed it there too because they understood the game.

[35:15] And so this is why if you think about it

[35:18] from actually an investment perspective,

[35:19] like education can't go down, it can't be taxed,

[35:23] it can't be taken from you and only gets better over time.

[35:26] And it compounds unto itself because when you learn the next skill,

[35:30] so let's say this is the lift we got from sales,

[35:34] then you learn lead junk.

[35:35] And then all of a sudden this because then you

[35:37] five X the demand on your sales skills

[35:42] and you just paid down your ignorance debt with two investments.

[35:47] And so like is that worth it more

[35:51] than putting the money in the S&P?

[35:53] In my opinion, every fucking time.

[35:56] It's going for 40 to 220 realistic.

[35:58] If you're a killer in your part of Moseenation,

[36:00] absolutely, if you do it the way we tell you to do it,

[36:02] which is you look at the top guy

[36:04] on whatever company, whatever team,

[36:06] and you do twice what they do.

[36:07] Because you know why?

[36:08] Because they're going to be better than you.

[36:09] And so you've got to make up with,

[36:10] you've got to make it up an inputs.

[36:12] It's like, but Alex, is that mean I'm going to have to work harder

[36:14] in longer hours, you bet?

[36:19] Walking to the world?

[36:21] Like, because think about it.

[36:22] If you work the same hours as that guy,

[36:24] that guy always has the advantage

[36:25] because he's already better than you.

[36:26] And so if he puts a month in and you put a month

[36:28] and he's going to get further ahead than you.

[36:30] Because he already has skills through which

[36:31] to judges own performance and improve.

[36:34] And so you have to put way more inputs in

[36:36] to get the same output than that guy.

[36:38] And so that's why Kobe spent five summers

[36:40] doing two days when everyone else was doing one a day

[36:42] because he knew he had to make up

[36:44] for the guys who were way better than him naturally.

[36:46] And so like I would like to think of everybody

[36:48] in Moseenation as many black mamba as from that perspective

[36:51] is that we're willing to put in twice the work three times

[36:54] the work four times the work

[36:55] despite the natural talent deficiencies

[36:57] to make up for it.

[36:59] Because on a five year or a 10 year or a 25 year timeline

[37:02] you become unbeatable.

[37:03] Do I think you can get to 220?

[37:06] Hellia.

[37:07] But if you were to just look at average

[37:09] which I don't want you to be.

[37:10] But if you were to look at average,

[37:11] you might make a hundred a year or 120 a year.

[37:14] It would still triple what you were making before.

[37:16] And if you don't adjust your living

[37:19] from what you were making at 40, Mr. Smart Cookie,

[37:22] then now you have even at 120, this is 120.

[37:27] You have 80K year extra that you can then invest in more skills

[37:32] to pay down your ignorance debt.

[37:34] A key point here is I said that there was an advantage

[37:36] that I have a warm buffet, which is I got money

[37:40] in time slash effort.

[37:43] If you go spend the money, but you don't put this in

[37:47] then you lose your advantage.

[37:48] And so it's not just about spending the money

[37:51] because here's an interesting fact to it for you.

[37:53] When you sell someone you understand

[37:55] that the moment someone buys,

[37:57] they actually feel like they've solved the problem emotionally.

[38:00] And so you can sell that

[38:01] because you learn how to sell.

[38:03] But the reality is that that just gives them the license

[38:06] to begin solving the problem.

[38:07] Of whatever it is, especially if it's a skill

[38:09] or it's education based.

[38:10] And here's my ask for you guys.

[38:12] One of the beliefs that I think is served me well

[38:13] is that whenever I joined a group or I joined a community

[38:16] or I free or paid or otherwise,

[38:18] I always wanted to become number one.

[38:20] And the way that I thought about that was,

[38:22] and I always wanted to join groups of people who were all

[38:23] ahead of me.

[38:24] Like when I joined that internet group

[38:25] that I was talking about earlier,

[38:26] everybody there was making more money.

[38:27] How do I get status in this group?

[38:29] At the way that I did that was like, be good.

[38:31] You know, I mean, make more money.

[38:32] And so what I did was I talked to every single person

[38:35] in the group and I had only my small skill set

[38:38] and I gave it to them for free.

[38:39] And I want to fucking hit on this

[38:40] because I get DMs every day about this.

[38:44] Guy this morning, even said it.

[38:45] He said, Alex, I want to make you 100 videos for free.

[38:50] If you're willing to employ me.

[38:55] The amount of times that I get this request

[38:57] whether it's I want to make you this website

[38:59] in exchange for a job.

[39:01] The point of imagination, the point of everything

[39:03] that I do act was that I hope to live by example,

[39:06] is that you give first without asking.

[39:08] You're doing it wrong.

[39:10] You think, and the way I was like,

[39:11] hey, in the spirit of my, it's like you're not doing

[39:13] in the spirit of my imagination.

[39:14] You're doing the spirit of John.

[39:15] All right, you're doing the spirit of you.

[39:17] The way that you do it is that you give

[39:19] and then you give and then you give

[39:22] and you keep on giving until that person is like,

[39:24] dude, what can I do for you?

[39:26] And then you make your ask.

[39:27] Like whenever I get frustrated and I think like,

[39:30] why do I even bother doing this?

[39:31] Like I think about giving up.

[39:33] I just think this is where most people stop

[39:37] and this is why they don't win.

[39:39] It transitions into one of my most use things to myself.

[39:42] I don't say a lot out loud, but to myself.

[39:44] I say like, I won't do my best.

[39:46] I'll do what's required.

[39:47] And so right now, what is required for you to win

[39:50] or get a job or get the skill?

[39:51] It might be better than your best.

[39:53] And so it just means that your best

[39:54] just needs to get better.

[39:56] All right, so you might be rolled up

[39:57] and be like, I'm gonna go do this

[39:58] and take over the world and make all the money.

[40:00] So, but you're like, fuck, I got a people's.

[40:02] So how do we take this and then put it into reality?

[40:04] Number one is like, and this is how you transfer

[40:07] any skills in general, by the way,

[40:08] a little sneak peek from the book that's coming up.

[40:10] All right, coming soon.

[40:12] Is it that you have,

[40:15] so the person is teaching you,

[40:17] documents the skill, that's step one.

[40:19] Step two is that they do it in front of you

[40:22] so they demonstrate it.

[40:24] And the third piece is duplicate.

[40:26] You do it in front of them.

[40:28] So document, demonstrate, duplicate.

[40:31] Now, I can do this and I can do this,

[40:35] but you have to do this.

[40:38] I can't duplicate it for you.

[40:39] You have to take the stuff and actually execute on it.

[40:41] And so if you're like, okay, Alex,

[40:44] what does that actually look like in my life?

[40:48] I'm actually a big, big proponent of having jobs

[40:50] and I think that's probably taboo nowadays,

[40:52] but yeah, why not get paid to learn shit?

[40:55] And if you're like, well, the place that I work at

[40:58] doesn't teach me anything,

[40:59] then you should absolutely go apply for other jobs,

[41:02] like change your conditions, all right?

[41:04] So I'm all about get paid to learn.

[41:10] And as an aside, the reason that keeping your living expenses

[41:12] low is so important is because if let's say

[41:15] you make a hundred thousand dollars a year now,

[41:16] and you're like, yeah, it's got a pretty good white

[41:17] college job right now, but I really want to get into this.

[41:19] Then it might mean that you have to go

[41:21] from a hundred thousand dollars a year to 30 thousand dollars a year

[41:24] to learn the skill, because right now you go from earning

[41:27] to learning, all right?

[41:28] And like, I want to tell you, like, I walk this walk.

[41:31] So I was a management consultant at a British Ratatty

[41:34] firm in DC, like I had a top sheet of clearance.

[41:37] I was 20, like I did, I did shit that people could brag about,

[41:40] all right?

[41:40] And then I went and became a personal trainer at a gym

[41:43] for $14 an hour, think about that.

[41:47] I went from a high-rise condo that I owned

[41:50] to renting someone's bedroom for $400 a month in their house, right?

[41:54] And I went from having, you know, Hugo Boss suits

[41:57] to wearing Beast Mode and Gauge T-shirts, all right?

[42:00] And showing up at 4 a.m., like, ready to teach Nancy

[42:03] how to lose the last five.

[42:04] You know what I mean?

[42:05] And so like, I had a swallow my pride on this

[42:09] because I wanted to, I wanted to get learned.

[42:14] All right?

[42:15] And so you have to be willing to relinquish

[42:19] getting paid for getting learned.

[42:22] All right?

[42:22] Once you get yourself an environment where you actually have a business

[42:25] that is investing in you, and it doesn't mean that they actually

[42:28] have to write checks to be clear.

[42:29] Now if you have a company that's willing to do that, awesome.

[42:31] Level one is you communicate to them.

[42:34] This is the skill that I would like to learn upon working for you.

[42:38] And so you're like, these are the skills that I've been to the table.

[42:40] This is what I would like to learn.

[42:42] Is this a place that I can do that?

[42:44] Any business owner loves clear communication.

[42:46] And so if you want to learn that, and if they're a good business

[42:48] owner, they're like, let me help you support.

[42:49] Now if they're like, my job is in the teach you wrong place.

[42:52] And I'm be real.

[42:53] A lot of business owners are like that.

[42:54] And so if you're like, well, man, it's not fair.

[42:57] It's like, well, I mean, getting paid to learn

[43:00] is a pretty good deal.

[43:01] It's just that that's not always what happens.

[43:03] And so I would say switch your conditions.

[43:05] But let's say you finally get into a business

[43:06] that teaches you stuff.

[43:07] And you feel like you're getting better

[43:08] in moving faster.

[43:09] I would say once you feel like, and this is a big caveat.

[43:12] This is like, fucking caveat.

[43:13] Once you have nothing left to learn from the current position,

[43:19] you communicate to them that you feel like you're learning

[43:21] is slow down.

[43:23] And then they may give you another opportunity to learn more.

[43:26] And if they feel like they can't actually teach you internally,

[43:28] they might say, I'll pay $10,000 a year.

[43:31] If you go through these programs or workshops or seminars

[43:34] or whatever, so you can, or certifications,

[43:36] so you can continue to level up your skill.

[43:38] A good employer will do that.

[43:39] And if you look at big corporate America,

[43:41] as much as people should on them,

[43:42] they usually have pretty strong corporate investment programs.

[43:44] Like, they why?

[43:45] Because they want their human capital to appreciate.

[43:49] And so if you can pay $10,000,

[43:50] because they do the same SME 500,

[43:52] except the SNU 500, right?

[43:54] They invest in you $10,000, and they get a three-time

[43:57] for valuable person.

[43:58] Like, one of the biggest arbitrage opportunities

[44:00] side of this when you talk in business owners.

[44:02] That's out there in the marketplace

[44:03] is that you can pay 25% more for an A player versus a B player

[44:07] and you get five times the output.

[44:08] So like, you think about value arbitrage.

[44:10] Like, it's been a pain a hundred a year

[44:11] and that's the market.

[44:12] Pay 125 and get five times the output.

[44:14] Why would you never make that trade?

[44:16] Once you've done this,

[44:17] here are the three steps that you can transition

[44:19] from getting learned back to getting paid.

[44:21] All right, number one is that you live below your means.

[44:25] The less risk you're taking your personal life,

[44:27] the more risk you're taking your business life.

[44:29] Let's say that I own a business

[44:30] that does $10,000 a year in profit, okay?

[44:33] If my living expenses are $800,000 a month,

[44:37] then I'm not leaving much for the business

[44:39] to weather a storm and let's say that it's all fixed.

[44:42] It's like mortgages and cars and jets

[44:45] and all the other stuff that I do.

[44:46] Well, if there's a hiccup, the business might go under.

[44:49] But if I live on 400,000 a year,

[44:51] then I have 9.6 million every year

[44:55] that I can go on the offensive

[44:56] and I can take huge swings.

[44:57] I can be like, I wanna buy this company

[44:59] even though it's risky, but it might 10x.

[45:02] And that offense is what you have to do

[45:03] as an entrepreneur, because you have to take

[45:05] calculated risk.

[45:06] But you don't want to introduce multiple risk

[45:07] if you can control it.

[45:08] And this is controllable risk, okay?

[45:11] So you live below your mean so you can stack cash, okay?

[45:14] Level two is that you take this cash

[45:16] and I wanna be clear,

[45:18] I'm actually kind of against side hustles

[45:20] as a long term thing.

[45:21] I'm pro them as a way to transition.

[45:24] Again, this is how I play the game.

[45:25] I'm a maximize, like I wanna win big.

[45:27] And so I think if you follow my stuff

[45:28] that you probably would have been big too.

[45:30] And so if you're doing a side hustle

[45:32] it's because you wanted to eventually become

[45:33] your main hustle, not because you're just looking

[45:35] for side income.

[45:36] I'm just not that guy.

[45:37] There's other guys who will talk about that.

[45:38] It's just not me.

[45:39] All right?

[45:40] And so you stack the cash, you can start your side hustle.

[45:42] And you keep doing this until you have a match

[45:46] your income.

[45:49] So you start your side hustle

[45:50] and you keep doing it until you match your current income.

[45:53] And if you're like wait a second,

[45:54] for me to match my current income,

[45:56] I'm gonna have to work 40 hours a week in my job

[45:57] and then work another 40 hours a week at this thing.

[46:01] Yep.

[46:02] And the thing is, and this is just one man's caveat,

[46:04] there's me different takes on this.

[46:06] If you're not making more money on 40 hours a week

[46:09] of the new thing, you're still not doing it right.

[46:11] Remember I went from employee to self-employed,

[46:13] you have a level of leverage.

[46:14] So those 40 hours you have more leverage

[46:16] than the 40 hours that you're working for someone else.

[46:18] And if you're not making more there,

[46:20] then you're like you still need to keep doing it

[46:21] until you've matched at least, at least match your income.

[46:25] And then once you've matched the income,

[46:27] I would say sustain it for six months.

[46:28] Two reasons.

[46:29] One is because now you're gonna be making double time.

[46:31] You're gonna be making money on your job,

[46:32] you're gonna be making money on your income.

[46:33] So you're gonna be doubling your actual income,

[46:34] which means you might be like three or four

[46:35] racks in your savings.

[46:36] And the second is so that you don't just quit

[46:38] on the one good month you had

[46:39] because you sent up your clients.

[46:40] Okay, we wanna make sure that it's not seasonal,

[46:42] we wanna make sure that we get,

[46:43] like it's not just normal volatility,

[46:45] because really small businesses super volatile.

[46:47] Right, if you're selling two customers a month,

[46:49] they've all of a sudden you sell zero,

[46:50] your income goes to zero, right?

[46:52] Unless you retain the people, that's that, etc.

[46:53] And then, cut, pay, cut the cord,

[46:57] and go out on your own.

[46:59] Spread those wings.

[47:00] You can be a beautiful butterfly.

[47:01] In a lot of people look at this thing,

[47:03] the side hustle, and they're like,

[47:04] but this isn't Facebook.

[47:06] Like this isn't sure, it's not.

[47:09] But I think a lot of people put undue pressure on themselves

[47:11] by expecting their next thing to be a trillion dollar company.

[47:14] And the likely that it happens,

[47:17] super super super super, super, super small.

[47:19] But again, it's like, what are your goals?

[47:21] If your goals are just like,

[47:22] get out of poverty, get above the middle class,

[47:24] get into the upper class,

[47:26] like a lot of businesses can get you there.

[47:28] If you wanna be a trillionaire, there's only a few.

[47:30] And also what we don't see is the Zillions of Not Zuckerbergs,

[47:34] who put everything into their social media thing,

[47:36] and it didn't work.

[47:37] I'm a big fan of service businesses

[47:39] because it costs you nothing to start.

[47:40] It's just your time.

[47:41] You have no overhead in the beginning.

[47:42] Those ones are harder to scale,

[47:44] but you'll usually learn a lot of other skills

[47:47] during that part.

[47:48] I learned more from running a gym

[47:49] that allowed me to do gymlaunch.

[47:51] Like, if I hadn't run the gym,

[47:52] I don't think I would have been able to do gymlaunch.

[47:54] And so think of whatever this is as the stepping stone.

[47:57] And again, we're still trying to get learned.

[47:59] Like, that doesn't change.

[48:00] We're just gonna also get paid as we do it.

[48:02] And that's one of the beautiful things

[48:03] that entrepreneurs,

[48:03] because that once you get past a certain level,

[48:05] you get paid to learn more.

[48:07] And I think that's for me why I love the game so much

[48:09] is that you just keep getting better

[48:11] and get paid to get better.

[48:12] Don't judge yourself on the side hustle,

[48:13] and especially don't listen to other people's

[48:16] judgment on your side hustle.

[48:17] You know, I was like,

[48:18] Vinterbro, Magical Mali, White Collar Consultant Job,

[48:21] like, had a above-harvard, you know,

[48:24] GMAT score, say like,

[48:26] and you wanna become a trainer?

[48:29] Like, the amount of people that like,

[48:30] I used to compete against friend of me,

[48:31] just whatever you wanna call it,

[48:32] they were like, oh, great, he's out of the race.

[48:34] You know what I mean?

[48:35] He's doing stuff to make himself happy, right?

[48:38] You know, I was younger,

[48:39] and I probably had more fucked up shit in my head

[48:41] than then I do now.

[48:41] But like, I used to just think about them all the time,

[48:44] when I'd be sleeping on the floor,

[48:45] I'd be selling more, I was like,

[48:45] they're not willing to do this.

[48:46] They're not willing to do this.

[48:48] And then you come from behind, right?

[48:50] And you do Kobe, and you work twice a day.

[48:52] And while they're working their job,

[48:53] and they have their three series BMW,

[48:54] and they're, you know, going out to dinner,

[48:56] and they have the football and the weekends

[48:58] and their fantasy league.

[48:59] And you have none of that.

[49:01] Just know that you're doing your two days during the summer,

[49:03] or your three days during the summer,

[49:05] but because your rate of input is so much higher than theirs is,

[49:08] you will catch up and you will surpass them.

[49:10] And that's if you wanna compare.

[49:11] And the main reason I don't think you should judge yourself

[49:14] on whatever you do is because, in my opinion,

[49:17] like, I'm married to the game, right, more than anything.

[49:20] Like, I'm gonna keep playing the game

[49:21] because I love the game.

[49:23] And so if you wanna play the game a long time,

[49:27] then it's the game itself that you wanna stick with

[49:29] rather than the vehicle you're in.

[49:31] Right, most entrepreneurs start more than one business

[49:34] over their career.

[49:35] You are above the business.

[49:36] The problem is that people identify so closely,

[49:38] like their identity is their business,

[49:40] but you have to just think about it.

[49:41] And this is me just trying to give you like a,

[49:43] you know, big brother, what do you wanna call it?

[49:45] Piece of advice, but like, the further you can separate

[49:47] your identity and yourself worth

[49:50] from the worth of the business,

[49:51] the better off you'll be as an entrepreneur.

[49:53] Because you also start to see as an asset,

[49:55] that can be sold, can create value in the asset.

[49:57] You can make hard decisions, whereas if it's you,

[49:59] you're like, what will people think?

[50:01] It's like, I made a decision about a business that I own.

[50:04] That's okay.

[50:05] Simon's a neck is a great piece on this,

[50:06] but when I learned the difference between infinite and finite games,

[50:09] it really changed my perspective.

[50:10] The infinite frame will always beat the finite frame.

[50:13] And there are finite games within every infinite game.

[50:15] And so you have quarters, you have years, you have goals.

[50:17] These are all finite games that we play in an infinite game.

[50:20] And so when the US invaded Vietnam, we lost.

[50:25] Why did we lose?

[50:26] We lost a war of attrition, which was that,

[50:28] they were willing to play the game longer than we were.

[50:31] All right, and so the difference in a finite infinite game

[50:33] is that a finite game has known players,

[50:36] agreed upon rules, and an outcome, and an end.

[50:40] That's why it's finite.

[50:41] An infinite game has known and unknown players,

[50:44] has no agreed upon rules, and the point of the game

[50:46] is to keep the game going.

[50:48] And so the problem that most entrepreneurs have

[50:50] is they approach an infinite game with a finite frame.

[50:53] They are the United States trying to invade Vietnam

[50:56] and you will lose every time.

[50:58] Because there will be players who are playing with an infinite frame.

[51:00] And so let me give you two more examples of this.

[51:02] If you want to get healthy, you don't win at health.

[51:06] There's no end goal to being, you're like,

[51:08] okay, I'm done working out.

[51:09] I did it, I've achieved it.

[51:11] Of course not.

[51:12] Same thing with marriage.

[51:14] Like you're not, the point is in two, get married.

[51:16] The point is the stay married.

[51:18] The point is to stay in the game, to keep the game going.

[51:21] Most of the games worth playing are infinite games,

[51:23] not finite games, which means the point is to just play.

[51:27] And so if business, you don't win,

[51:29] the point isn't to finish.

[51:30] Because even if you were trying to say you finished first,

[51:32] it's like by what metric, on what time period.

[51:36] Has there anyone who's been the richest man

[51:37] in the world for all time?

[51:41] No, of course not.

[51:43] Which means that anybody who would try to do that

[51:45] is coming from a finite frame.

[51:46] And so, but there have been people who've won the game of business

[51:49] in my perspective because they played their whole lives.

[51:52] If you want to be a stronger player

[51:55] and be somebody who can succeed as an entrepreneur,

[51:58] then the day you start playing is the day you win

[52:01] and the day you stop playing is the day you lose.

[52:04] And so the goal is to find games that you don't want to quit.

[52:08] That's where learning what you are into from executing

[52:13] is the mega win here.

[52:15] So for me, I found out that I actually like business more

[52:17] than I like to fitness, which is crazy

[52:19] because I love fitness, getting into fitness.

[52:21] But like the day I started my gym was the day,

[52:23] my love for business, outpace, my love for fitness.

[52:25] I was like, this is amazing.

[52:27] This is so cool.

[52:28] And so you have to find whatever that thing is

[52:31] and I'm be clear, like business sucks all the time.

[52:35] But it's just that if you're willing to play

[52:37] and like there's plenty of times merit sucks.

[52:38] There's plenty of times you don't want to work out.

[52:40] But it doesn't mean that I'm going to stop working out.

[52:42] It doesn't mean I'm going to stop being merit.

[52:43] It's going to be going to stop being a business.

[52:45] And so I think if you can unlock that frame

[52:47] that you wouldn't play until the day you die,

[52:50] even if the vehicle changes,

[52:51] even the players that you're playing with

[52:53] on the court change, then you'll be the guy

[52:56] who stays on the court the longest.

[52:57] You might think, oh, I don't like video editing.

[52:59] Or, oh, I don't like dry cleaning.

[53:01] I don't like mowing lawns.

[53:02] I don't like washing cars, whatever it is.

[53:04] But the higher up you get in business,

[53:07] the more all businesses are the same.

[53:09] You're going to have marketing, you're going to have sales,

[53:11] you're going to have product,

[53:12] you're going to have customer success,

[53:13] your customer support, you're going to have IT,

[53:14] you're going to have finance, you're going to have legal.

[53:16] Like all these departments are going to,

[53:18] these functions will more or less exist in every business.

[53:21] And so my advice is, a lot of people quit industries

[53:26] when they really actually just quit a function of a job.

[53:29] And so they're like, oh, entertainment wasn't for me.

[53:31] It's like, do you know how many jobs there are in entertainment?

[53:33] Like you might love sales in entertainment.

[53:35] Sales in entertainment.

[53:36] And you were in the actual product side, right?

[53:40] Or the production side, or the support side.

[53:42] And so again, remember I said earlier that if you stay

[53:45] in the same game longer, you'll be likely to get more reps

[53:47] in and you'll do better.

[53:48] Well, then maybe stay in the same industry,

[53:50] but switch roles.

[53:52] Now, in a micro business, like your side hustle,

[53:54] you'll get to taste all the roles,

[53:55] and you'll find out the things that you like more.

[53:57] And that's where you can shift some of your attention there.

[54:00] And then you backfill people who are,

[54:01] because you have a little bit of context, good enough

[54:04] to do what you do better.

[54:05] You demonstrate, sorry, you document,

[54:07] you demonstrate, you duplicate, they duplicate,

[54:08] and then they run with it, right?

[54:11] And so today, for example, my, what I do

[54:15] looks very different than when I did 10 years ago.

[54:17] Like what I did 10 years ago is the highest value scale I had,

[54:20] which is just closing.

[54:21] Like, it's all I did, I consults all day,

[54:22] because I got trainers to train for me.

[54:24] I knew how to run the ads,

[54:25] and that didn't take me that long,

[54:26] took me two, three hours a week,

[54:27] to run the ads, make them an manager.

[54:30] The rest of my time was sitting in appointments

[54:33] and closing.

[54:34] And I had somebody else make the phone calls and text for me.

[54:36] So I would just sit there and close,

[54:37] because that was the highest value thing I could do at the time.

[54:40] But the thing is, is that your baseline skill

[54:42] will continue to love a lot.

[54:43] If I lost everything then, like if I lost everything,

[54:46] I knew that I would sell car star in the day,

[54:47] and I would strip at night.

[54:49] Once I had that skill,

[54:50] before I had the skill of sales,

[54:51] I would drive Uber during the day and strip at night,

[54:52] because I had the skill been a japed, right?

[54:54] And so your baseline continues to grow.

[54:57] Like being the best car sales,

[54:58] being like 400, 500, maybe even a million here,

[55:00] at some of the best dealerships,

[55:01] like if you're an absolute savage,

[55:02] and I would consider myself an absolute savage.

[55:04] If I was gonna do that, right?

[55:05] If I lost it all, I'd be there 12 hours a day for sure.

[55:08] And then, once I learned how to market,

[55:10] marketing and sales together, my new minimum,

[55:12] was a million bucks here,

[55:13] because I knew that I could sit in front of any brick and mortar business,

[55:16] and I could get him leads and I could close.

[55:17] Once you have that, you can make a million,

[55:19] two million, three million, three million,

[55:19] like I can't go below that,

[55:20] because I have skills that are above that, right?

[55:23] You keep learning these skills

[55:25] as you keep doing your business,

[55:26] and you might, you'll start ping-ponging

[55:29] in different directions,

[55:30] until you hone in on the things that you're best at.

[55:32] And so I think if you can find that game,

[55:33] make it the meta skill of continuing to learn,

[55:36] then you won't stop.

[55:38] And then at that point, it means you went by default.

[55:41] So we talked about a lot of stuff, right?

[55:43] But the question is, what's the next thing you're gonna do?

[55:45] And so I'm just gonna give you advice that I followed,

[55:47] which is like, what was the first thing I did

[55:48] to get myself out of this million dollar,

[55:50] or below million dollar category,

[55:52] to the above million dollar category?

[55:53] And then to eventually the point 4%

[55:55] 10 million dollar category,

[55:56] and it was actually just learning how to sell.

[55:58] Because if you can't sell anything, you can't make money.

[56:01] It's the first part of the equation.

[56:02] Number of sales times.

[56:04] If you have no sales,

[56:05] it doesn't matter how good the left advice

[56:06] if no one buys it, zero.

[56:07] So I have what we call the best sales training

[56:10] on the internet, it's a long keynote

[56:12] that I did that people really dig,

[56:14] and I think you'll hopefully like it

[56:16] and get as much from it as it took me years

[56:19] to consolidate it for you.

[56:20] It's a good bargain on your time to get

[56:22] 10 years of sales training into an hour.

[56:24] So enjoy.

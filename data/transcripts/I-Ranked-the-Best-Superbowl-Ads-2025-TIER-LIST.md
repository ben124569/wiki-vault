[00:00] So Superlads are eight million bucks each now,

[00:02] and the big question is, is it worth it?

[00:03] And what can you learn from them as a business

[00:05] to improve your advertising?

[00:06] I'm Alex Ramosi, I'm an actresses.

[00:08] Not com, I've earned millions of dollars of ads.

[00:09] And today I'm going to tear up the ads

[00:11] at the Superlacross Six You Factor

[00:13] to determine whether it was a touchdown

[00:15] where fumble isn't a cute,

[00:17] cute little analogy, touchdown or from them.

[00:19] First up, Google, take it away.

[00:21] So at my last job, I was working across several different groups.

[00:27] You know what, let me practice that one again.

[00:29] Okay, when you're ready, tell me about the job

[00:31] that taught you the most.

[00:35] Okay.

[00:38] Well, it was a role where I learned to take constructive criticism.

[00:42] I think you look out, no, doesn't like it.

[00:44] Okay, I got pretty used to, you know,

[00:46] working long hours with the small teeth.

[00:50] I got very comfortable, multitasked, yeah.

[00:53] And I had to become really organized.

[00:56] Not bad, but try rephrasing your answer

[00:58] to sound more confident.

[00:59] Right, right, okay.

[01:02] I was asked to make a lot of quick decisions

[01:04] and do a lot of negotiating one more book.

[01:07] Three.

[01:08] Talk about your experiences working with others.

[01:11] Oh, well, I'm not my best one.

[01:13] I'm collaborating.

[01:14] If it's for the team, well, do whatever it takes.

[01:17] This job description you shared mentions on the job training.

[01:20] Well, I am a fast learner.

[01:25] I don't always have all the answers.

[01:28] But I get the job done, look at us.

[01:31] No matter how long it takes.

[01:34] And I'm not afraid to admit when I'm wrong.

[01:39] But most importantly, I show up every day, no matter what.

[01:45] All right, last question, when it comes to work,

[01:47] what motivates you?

[01:53] I guess knowing that people can depend on me.

[01:58] I know what you're doing.

[02:00] I know what you're doing.

[02:01] I know what you're doing.

[02:03] I know what you're doing.

[02:04] I know what you're doing.

[02:05] I know what you're doing.

[02:06] I know what you're doing.

[02:07] I know what you're doing.

[02:08] I know what you're doing.

[02:09] I know what you're doing.

[02:10] I know what you're doing.

[02:11] I know what you're doing.

[02:12] I know what you're doing.

[02:13] I know what you're doing.

[02:14] I know what you're doing.

[02:15] I know what you're doing.

[02:16] I know what you're doing.

[02:17] I know what you're doing.

[02:18] I know what you're doing.

[02:19] I know what you're doing.

[02:20] I know what you're doing.

[02:21] I know what you're doing.

[02:22] I know what you're doing.

[02:23] I know what you're doing.

[02:25] So real quick, what we're going to be ranking these on is,

[02:28] did it grab attention?

[02:29] Did it make you care?

[02:30] Did it sell the dream?

[02:31] Did it create urgency?

[02:32] Did it show social proof?

[02:33] And most importantly, did it tell you what to do next?

[02:35] This ad, I think, was exceptional, honestly.

[02:37] I think it's set for a number of reasons.

[02:39] The first is that they draw this really, you know,

[02:41] very sentimental story arc.

[02:43] It was almost like the up movie where you get the whole love story

[02:45] in two minutes in the movie.

[02:47] This was basically that just done in like 30 seconds.

[02:50] But they were able to weave in product demonstration

[02:54] and usage throughout the entire thing,

[02:56] which I think made it incredibly compelling.

[02:57] In terms of what to do next at the end,

[02:59] I mean, they tell you about the product,

[03:00] but I think what they really drive is sentiment with this ad,

[03:04] which is that I think a lot of people would be like,

[03:06] I resonate with any one or many of those slides,

[03:09] because either you've been the kid, you've been the adult,

[03:11] you've been the one for the job.

[03:13] They actually cut a lot of different audiences

[03:14] by showing all these very human experiences,

[03:16] and they've done it.

[03:17] They did it super well.

[03:18] In terms of proof, they're literally demonstrating

[03:20] in terms of urgency.

[03:21] I don't think it would be on brand for them

[03:22] to create urgency.

[03:23] So I would knock them for that,

[03:24] such as very direct responsey.

[03:26] And so big picture, the Google Genome, Gemini, I add,

[03:28] I think I moved to Est here.

[03:29] I think it was exceptional.

[03:30] I haven't seen the rest of the ads,

[03:31] but I'm bullish on the start, I know.

[03:33] So add number two is ramp.com.

[03:35] Hey, should we pull Sake one off the field right now

[03:38] to submit his expenses?

[03:39] You better not say yes.

[03:41] So this was a short ad, obviously, what is this?

[03:43] 15 seconds.

[03:44] So they probably spent four or five million for this ad,

[03:46] instead of the full eight for 30.

[03:48] Unless it was eight for 15.

[03:49] Somebody can fact check me.

[03:50] Anyways, I think the hook was contextual to the audience

[03:52] that was watching, which was a football player, right?

[03:55] And so that made sense.

[03:55] Question based hook around pain, fundamentals.

[03:58] And I'm a big fan of this, and I think I'm not

[04:00] at a lot of business owners do this,

[04:02] but it's a big deal.

[04:03] I think the hook was contextual to the audience

[04:05] that was watching, which was a football player, right?

[04:07] And so that made sense.

[04:08] Question based hook around pain, fundamentals.

[04:10] But it's demonstration.

[04:11] They start with a pain based hook of what it's like

[04:13] to not have the product.

[04:15] And then they just immediately solve it

[04:17] with having the product or demonstration.

[04:19] I mean, if you're talking about 15 seconds

[04:21] to get a pointer cross, I think it was a pretty effective ad.

[04:24] I probably would have done more with the end screen

[04:27] personally, and I probably would have said switch your business

[04:29] too rather than have it just be audio.

[04:31] Main reason is a lot of people are watching TV from afar.

[04:35] They don't have subtitles on.

[04:37] So I tend to be over-indexed on text personally,

[04:41] but that's just my own opinion.

[04:42] I would put that as an A, and then it was a good ad.

[04:45] So ad3 is booking.com.

[04:46] That's right.

[04:47] With hotels and vacation rentals,

[04:48] booking.com has something for everyone.

[04:51] Yeah?

[04:51] Yeah, she's so!

[04:53] You can only say your book.

[04:54] We really write this way.

[04:56] Yeah, we're talking about what about something more family

[04:59] friendly.

[05:01] Maybe a resort with a water park?

[05:05] Or somewhere less family friendly?

[05:07] Yep, one Vegas hotel for the bride to be.

[05:09] What if we hate everything?

[05:10] We have for cancellation.

[05:12] Find exactly what you're booking for.

[05:14] Booking.com, booking.com.

[05:16] Personally, not a huge fan of it.

[05:19] It felt super TV-ish.

[05:21] Now, you might be like, well, this was Ron on TV,

[05:23] but it felt like an old ad.

[05:26] Like it was a new, it's obviously it's a new ad,

[05:28] but obviously the muppets are an old brand.

[05:30] But it just felt like 2005 television.

[05:34] That's just, that was my initial impression.

[05:36] They tried to demonstrate the use cases.

[05:38] I think the humor wasn't like super funny.

[05:40] And so I think I had a more difficult time

[05:41] of being like, oh, I'm this avatar personally.

[05:44] And so I probably would have done this ad

[05:45] to completely differently if it were me.

[05:47] I probably would put this,

[05:50] I don't know if I want to use up a D all the way.

[05:52] I'll probably, I'm going to put this as C.

[05:54] I'll put this as C.

[05:55] I didn't like starting with booking.com.

[05:58] That's what the first thing you see is booking.com.

[06:00] I don't know what that is yet.

[06:01] They hint at some pain.

[06:02] I had a harder time because the cuts were fast,

[06:05] but weren't explainatory.

[06:07] Like I didn't know where we were going.

[06:09] It just felt super mid.

[06:10] Like compare that to the Google ad.

[06:11] It's like, what do we even talk about?

[06:13] Like I feel like it's leaving close.

[06:14] So add number four from Doritos

[06:16] is made from a fan content.

[06:17] So I'm actually really pumped to watch this one.

[06:19] My onions.

[06:20] You're a phoge detective.

[06:21] You're a phoge detective.

[06:22] You're a phoge detective.

[06:23] Go.

[06:24] You're a phoge detective.

[06:26] You're a phoge detective.

[06:27] Come on, man.

[06:37] There we go.

[06:42] Dorito.

[06:45] Dorito.

[06:46] Dorito.

[06:47] Yeah.

[06:48] I like this ad.

[06:50] What's really interesting is that there's basically no words,

[06:52] which I find great.

[06:53] So this is all creative if you want to think about

[06:55] from that perspective.

[06:56] If you think about psychological triggers here though,

[06:58] what they're showing is that it's something super desired.

[07:00] Not only that, it's that somebody would literally risk their life in order to keep it.

[07:04] But then they've closed the loop at the end and showed that it's actually like peace.

[07:07] One person sharing with another.

[07:08] So as much as it's, I don't know if it was deliberate or not.

[07:11] But there's actually a lot of, kind of like, humans, psychology stuff that's kind of built into this.

[07:14] I'm a fan.

[07:15] I wouldn't, I mean, this is very on brand for Doritos, which is just like crazy.

[07:18] Bold.

[07:19] Right.

[07:19] Like it's almost like they have a red bull brand, but for chips.

[07:22] So kind of interesting there.

[07:23] The way the Doritos did this is the way that I would do this,

[07:25] which is at the end of the day like I'm going to,

[07:27] I'm going to, we're going to spice up these ads and I'll break down some of the things that I would have considered doing.

[07:31] You can't beat data.

[07:32] And so like you might have an opinion somebody else might have an opinion, but at the end of the day, the best ad that's on here is the one that drove the most sales.

[07:38] Now obviously a big part of that happens with past history of brand.

[07:42] And so some advertisements have different objectives.

[07:45] Right.

[07:46] A lot of, some ads might just be purely branding.

[07:48] They want to build positive sentiment of positive association between their product or their company.

[07:52] And the, you know, the Target demographic audience.

[07:54] Some of the just reinforcing the existing position like Doritos is some of them are a pre-direct response ad.

[07:58] So I think it really depends on the objective, but for here from a data perspective,

[08:02] if Zillion to people already submitted different ads, and this one got uploaded the most or shared the most,

[08:07] then you already know you have almost like a pre-baked winner.

[08:09] And so like when I wrote the,

[08:11] Leads book, which is all about advertising.

[08:14] One of the, one of the things that I break down in here is if you see this on page 37 and all the way through,

[08:20] I did headline tests for the headline in this book.

[08:23] And so I could have talked to five people and said, hey, do you like $100,000 advertising?

[08:26] Or do you like $100,000 leads?

[08:28] Or do you like $100,000 promotions?

[08:29] Or you like $100,000 marketing, right?

[08:31] I could have gone through all of these different, different relations.

[08:33] But instead I just let the data talk.

[08:34] What they did is they let the data talk and fundamentally who am I to say,

[08:37] one thing is better than another.

[08:39] But this is obviously the most viral ad that they, they were able to source.

[08:42] And here's the even more brilliant part.

[08:43] It costs them basically nothing.

[08:45] They just let the audience make it for them,

[08:47] which is basically crowdsourcing your advertising, which is a big fan of,

[08:50] and one of the great things about building communities, which you can check out at school.com.

[08:54] So they gave a million bucks for winning, but for most of these big ad agencies,

[08:57] it would cost them more than a million dollars to make the ad,

[08:59] and not even be sure if it's going to be good or not.

[09:01] Here they got this $5 million dollars to crowdsource from the best creators out there

[09:04] that obviously love their product.

[09:06] And if a customer makes an ad for your product,

[09:09] they're going to know more intimately that anyone will at some ad agency,

[09:12] where there's a bunch of, you know, tweens trying to figure out like whatever the hell they figure out.

[09:16] This is people actually use the product.

[09:18] And so also as another quick side note, you might not be the demo.

[09:21] So if you, when I say demo, I mean, demographic.

[09:24] So like, you might not be the target.

[09:25] So if some of these ad you're like, I don't know if this really,

[09:27] like, ramp might not have, like, if you're a business owner, ramp makes sense.

[09:30] If you don't own a business, you probably don't care at all about ramp, right?

[09:34] And so making sure that we're judging appropriately based on whether we are the avatar for the ad,

[09:37] also carries weight.

[09:39] So I'm going to give this a, I'm going to give this an a.

[09:41] So the next ad is Jeep.

[09:44] Longest thing we ever do is live our lives.

[09:49] But life doesn't come with an owner's manual.

[09:52] Might have been nice, huh?

[09:54] But that means we get to write our own stories.

[09:59] Freedom is, yes, or no, or maybe.

[10:13] Freedom is for everybody, but it isn't free.

[10:16] It's a bond.

[10:18] There are real heroes in the world, but not the ones in the movies.

[10:26] Real heroes are humble.

[10:28] They're not driven by pride.

[10:31] Pride is a terrible driver.

[10:34] Freedom is a war.

[10:36] One man's inch.

[10:39] And the silence of another's.

[10:42] Freedom is the ability to inspire.

[10:50] The most sacred thing in life isn't the path.

[10:56] It's the freedom to choose him.

[10:59] You don't have to be friends with someone to wave at him.

[11:04] We won't always agree on which way to go.

[11:10] But our differences can be our strength.

[11:13] So choose, but choose wisely.

[11:16] Choose what makes you happy.

[11:18] My friends, my family.

[11:21] My work, make me happy.

[11:23] This Jeep makes me happy, given the my name is.

[11:28] That's my honor, it's magical.

[11:33] How is it?

[11:35] It's good out there.

[11:36] Right, you're home.

[11:37] Is that whole thing?

[11:38] It's like that was true.

[11:39] Did they run that whole thing?

[11:42] So if Jeep ran a two minute ad or two and a half minute ad,

[11:46] then they spent whatever eight times five, which is a lot of eight times five.

[11:50] Right.

[11:51] When you're counting millions, okay, what I want to do is actually show you what happened in this ad

[11:55] because this is branding.

[11:57] And I was such a clear equation that they used that I want to break it down for you.

[12:01] So they said Jeep equals freedom.

[12:05] This is literally as clear as day association as you can make.

[12:09] Then they said freedom is stuff, our demo likes.

[12:14] If you like these things, you like Jeep.

[12:16] And then they just hit thing after thing after thing after thing after thing.

[12:19] To be purposeful to curate the associations that they wanted to make with Jeep.

[12:24] Notice they didn't say Jeep starting at 13 finance for 68 months and zero percent APR.

[12:29] Whatever.

[12:30] They didn't do any of that.

[12:31] This was a pure brand-based ad.

[12:33] There's obviously product placement inside of it, which is fine.

[12:35] We're trying to reinforce the brand.

[12:37] I would say that they're being very specific about the advertisers that they're trying to attract.

[12:41] And so I would bet you that the things that they chose in terms of the stuff they liked are things that they know

[12:46] from customer research because if you can drop 40 million on an ad or whatever they spent.

[12:50] If you're not sure about the actual research they did, I'll bet you they picked the words and things they knew their demo like.

[12:55] Now if you watch this, I can tell you that this is probably not targeted at women.

[12:59] I can probably also tell you that this is going to lean to a more conservative crowd.

[13:02] I can tell you this is probably going to be more and more promulitary.

[13:04] We were thinking about this like he said freedom is in free.

[13:06] That's more commonly a right leaning narrative.

[13:09] They probably know their avatar is more right leaning.

[13:12] They know their avatar.

[13:13] And so they made it clear, equal sign in terms of what they're about.

[13:17] If you like freedom you'll like cheap and freedom is all of these things that you like.

[13:21] So like cheap basically.

[13:22] And I do think the little quip at the end with Harrison Ford was nice about it being his last name a little bit of a shot across the bow.

[13:28] But fundamentally, he's just pure brand.

[13:30] I think this is a good ad.

[13:31] I wouldn't say it's the Google ad.

[13:32] I would say it's an eight year.

[13:33] It was a good ad.

[13:34] All right, next ad is Hins and Hers.

[13:36] Obesity is America's deadliest epidemic.

[13:39] This is America.

[13:40] 74% of us are overweight.

[13:43] An obesity leads to half a million deaths each year.

[13:46] Why is just stuff to stop eating, Jimmy?

[13:48] This is America.

[13:49] Something's broken.

[13:50] It's not our bodies.

[13:51] It's the system.

[13:52] Welcome to late-law's in America.

[13:54] Like it's a skyd.

[13:55] A $160 billion industry that feeds on our failure.

[13:59] There are medications that work.

[14:01] But the price for profits is not patients.

[14:04] This is America.

[14:05] This system wasn't built to help us.

[14:07] It was built to keep us sick and stuck.

[14:10] But not anymore.

[14:12] Hins and Hers offers life-changing, late-law's medications.

[14:15] They are affordable, doctor-tested, and formulated in the US that you get a treatment plan designed by a doctor to fit your body,

[14:23] goals, and lifestyle.

[14:25] You deserve to feel great in your body.

[14:28] This is the future of healthcare.

[14:30] This is Hins and Hers.

[14:32] Join us in the fight for a healthier America.

[14:35] Initial impression is simply visually jarring.

[14:37] Obviously because you've got a big stomach that just flaps and you've got weight.

[14:40] It's basically a very fear-based hook.

[14:42] What was interesting to me is that I've never seen Hins and Hers as healthcare, which is what they said.

[14:48] So I don't know if they're trying to shift their brand, and that was kind of the goal they had with this particular ad.

[14:53] It did feel a little bit, I don't know if they disingenuous.

[14:56] But basically they were like all these medications are meant for profit, and then they were like take our medication.

[15:01] And so that felt very like pandering.

[15:04] It just probably wouldn't have been that strategy.

[15:06] So, by and large, this is a branding-based ad.

[15:08] But I think this serves as a perfect juxtaposition between the G-Bad, which I think was a really excellent ad from a branding perspective.

[15:14] And this ad, which I don't think hit the mark for me.

[15:18] Also, I didn't see any dream outcome.

[15:21] The G-Bad talks about what people want.

[15:23] They want freedom, and they demonstrate freedom visually and a lot of freedom-based occasions.

[15:27] Here, I see a lot of overweight people.

[15:29] Now, maybe if you're an overweight person, you would say, oh, this ad is for me.

[15:32] But I don't know how many like their thin and all of the people were taking their stuff or not.

[15:36] There's a lot of little things that I wasn't the biggest fan of, but I think they would want to also demonstrate that like it works for people who are not overweight.

[15:42] But because they also do like hair replacement, I think they do a bunch of other things besides weight loss, but maybe G-B-1 products are just crushing it for them.

[15:50] That being said, to me, this was the worst ad.

[15:53] I think what was the one that we had at C-tier booking?

[15:56] Yeah, I think this one's worse than that.

[15:58] I'll put that as a day.

[15:59] Because the question we have to ask ourselves is, does an overweight person,

[16:02] let's just say that they're trying to make themselves more accessible for overweight people?

[16:06] So then we asked the question, okay, would it overweight people like?

[16:09] Well, they had a lot of stuff they didn't like, but they didn't show a lot of stuff that they did.

[16:13] And then they also bring to themselves as healthcare, which maybe there's a strategy around that.

[16:17] But I think most of the weight people heat thinking about how they have healthcare and like their sick and fat and all the stuff.

[16:24] I will say, I'm limited because I've never been overweight, and so I don't know.

[16:27] But yeah, my initial impression was not like, yeah, this looks really compelling.

[16:31] All right, ad seven is on.

[16:33] That's a slice.

[16:34] Oh, Mr. Roger Federer, why does it say Q and C on your shoulders?

[16:39] That's an O and N for on.

[16:42] Um, huh.

[16:44] Well, you know, how my nose is alphabet and does definitely appear at a C.

[16:48] Trust me, hello, it's on.

[16:50] Okay, but you know, how my loves you, Mr. Roger Federer,

[16:54] even if you don't know your alphabet, you look like on, right?

[16:58] Yeah, Roger.

[17:02] I'm going to tell you where my score is on this one to me to see.

[17:04] I'll tell you why I think it's a C.

[17:06] Like I would say the the one before this was I had a bad after taste from the last ad.

[17:11] This one is just like, it has nothing to do with anything besides you have a celebrity endorsement.

[17:16] And they're just talking about the letters of the name of the company.

[17:20] Is this a branding ad, right?

[17:21] So does it make associations that are target audience like now they might like Federer,

[17:26] but the subject matter they're talking about is just like the name of the company.

[17:30] And I think they made this ad all about them rather than making all about the customer.

[17:34] And I think that's where they missed.

[17:35] So I think they just forgot like rule number one is that like no one cares about you.

[17:38] They just care about themselves.

[17:39] And so I think they missed the mark there.

[17:40] I would say that it wasn't distasteful, but I put it as a C.

[17:42] Addy, go to Addy, let's rip it.

[17:44] Actors, we have the power to convince the world we know what we're doing.

[17:48] When in fact, we do not.

[17:52] I can make you believe I'm an detective without ever stepping foot in an actual crime scene.

[17:58] I see.

[18:01] These symbols probably symbolize something.

[18:06] Namino's don't with Addy, what a damn deal with my planet.

[18:10] I had an idea!

[18:12] As for not, no.

[18:14] Houston, I'm observing some debris coming from Uranus.

[18:20] Oh my heart's show yet.

[18:23] Small business owner.

[18:26] Because I have no idea what I'm doing.

[18:28] Let's go, Addy Arrow does.

[18:29] Using AI to build a logo, website, and social content.

[18:33] So I can start Walton Goggins, Gaga Blast.

[18:36] Because if you goggles ain't Goggins, they don't belong in Naggins.

[18:41] With GoDaddy Arrow, it's like you know what you're doing.

[18:44] So this one, I first thought I didn't really enjoy the call out because it actors as like almost the call out.

[18:49] So to me that like, I'm like, well, this immediately I'm like this doesn't apply to me.

[18:53] And then it takes like two thirds of the ad of just kind of like demonstrating not knowing what you're doing.

[18:58] But really not knowing where it's going at all.

[19:01] And then at the very end it's like, oh, it's GoDaddy, which is a hosting site, but can help you build your website with AI.

[19:07] I would have just liked real world business owners not knowing how to do many other things.

[19:12] And then having this be the one thing that they had figured out how to do right.

[19:16] I would have loved to see like a before after with this being like three, four, five things in a row that a business owner doesn't know how to do.

[19:22] Insert new amazing thing the GoDaddy hosting and then now they revisit the old things and they can do one, two, three, four, five and then recap CTA.

[19:31] I think that would have been a far more effective ad and I think the more emotive those five things were the more compelling the ad would have been.

[19:37] Right, so it's like how do I pay payroll like that would be like an interesting thing right now.

[19:41] Of course, you're not going to build a paper website, but this is me thinking off the top of a head.

[19:46] But like there are elements there that you could probably take of business owners like it probably be like answer my phone.

[19:52] The email because they do all of these things on the site.

[19:55] So I probably think through each of those elements and just drove before and after.

[19:59] I'm going to put this in the C category.

[20:02] I was in a huge fan as a as a business owner.

[20:04] I wasn't like super compelled also random, but like I don't know if small business owners at all care about how actors pretend to know what they're doing.

[20:12] And I don't know if you think about this from a pairing perspective what they did was they compared actors and small business owners and they equated the two.

[20:19] And I think most small business owners probably wouldn't want to call themselves actors.

[20:24] Now they might have done some research to figure out like look like you know what you're doing and I'll bet you that phrase might convert.

[20:31] But I think they might have taken like a creative team might have taken like who else acts like they know what they're doing.

[20:37] Actors and I just think that was probably the miss personally.

[20:41] Yeah and I'll be clear.

[20:42] I think there were a couple elements of humor.

[20:43] I think that Nogans and Gogans thing was funny.

[20:45] I think I think the second frame where he did something I thought was kind of cute.

[20:48] But it was like what are we talking about here?

[20:50] And so the thing is it has to keep your attention and it didn't really keep my attention because I didn't know what this is about.

[20:56] And this was the only ad we've watched so far that I had to rewatch to try and understand.

[21:00] And if that's what a lot of people had to do then they're just never going to rewatch it and like the moment's gone.

[21:06] All right.

[21:07] Add nine.

[21:08] Release the house.

[21:12] Rubbing monkey baby.

[21:14] Oh, no.

[21:15] Oh, no.

[21:16] Oh, no.

[21:17] Oh, no.

[21:18] Oh, no.

[21:19] Oh, no.

[21:20] Oh, no.

[21:21] Oh, no.

[21:22] Oh, no.

[21:23] Oh, no.

[21:24] Oh, no.

[21:25] Oh, no.

[21:26] Oh, no.

[21:27] I'm on the porch.

[21:29] It's like the way we take the house.

[21:31] Grossories are here.

[21:33] Thanks, babe.

[21:34] Get the milk.

[21:35] Get the milk.

[21:36] Get the milk.

[21:38] I think we're going to have our first B.

[21:39] I'll tell you what I think they did well.

[21:41] I'll tell you things I didn't like.

[21:43] So I think them showing the actual end result of using the product, which is groceries delivered immediately.

[21:50] And then her having to go get the cow.

[21:52] I think that was the most compelling part of the ad the last like four or five seconds, which is good because at least it's close to the CTA.

[21:57] Well, at least the CTA is at least telling you what the company's about.

[22:00] In terms of the actual ad itself.

[22:02] Now, they probably they might have been able to do some sort of co-op with a lot of these brands because they're getting, you know,

[22:06] add so they might have all chipped in to do this because thinking about like this, if they help

[22:10] Instagram is a distributor of their products.

[22:14] And so if they help advertise Instagram, then increase likely that people use the

[22:17] CTA to purchase these things.

[22:19] So I'll bet you that these specific products will probably see an uptick among

[22:22] Instagram users.

[22:24] That being said, it took me a little bit more than a half second to figure out what this is about.

[22:28] And I also try to think about this from the perspective of someone who doesn't know what

[22:31] Instagram is.

[22:32] I know what Instagram is, but if you don't know what Instagram is, you're like, what the hell is this thing?

[22:35] I like a more tactical experience for a customer or a prospect to understand what problem this solves.

[22:42] I think that's why I think the last five seconds was compelling like, oh, you forgot milk.

[22:46] Then, you know, rush ordering the milk.

[22:48] That was probably the most salient use case in the ad.

[22:52] And so if you have the opportunity to demonstrate that within your own advertising, the problem and then the immediate solution being your product.

[22:57] I see that as a good thing.

[22:58] But I think the first, you know, 70% 80% of the ad could have been better.

[23:04] I like the last five or six seconds.

[23:06] So I'll put it as a beat.

[23:07] All right, add 10 Novartis breast cancer screening.

[23:10] Wow.

[23:11] I see you looking at me.

[23:15] I see you looking.

[23:18] Look at that, look at that, look at that.

[23:19] Look at that, look at that.

[23:20] You get lift.

[23:21] You get height.

[23:22] You get power.

[23:23] I don't know.

[23:24] You're 10, don't know.

[23:25] You're 10, don't know.

[23:26] I still don't show.

[23:27] I wanna show you.

[23:28] I know.

[23:29] I'm gonna keep on dancing.

[23:31] I'm so you can keep on dancing.

[23:33] I'm gonna keep on dancing.

[23:34] I'm gonna keep on dancing.

[23:35] I'm gonna keep on dancing.

[23:36] I'm gonna keep on dancing.

[23:37] I'm gonna keep on dancing.

[23:38] I'm gonna keep on dancing.

[23:39] I'm gonna keep on dancing.

[23:40] I'm gonna keep on dancing.

[23:41] I'm gonna keep on dancing.

[23:42] I'm gonna keep on dancing.

[23:43] I'm gonna keep on dancing.

[23:44] I'm gonna keep on dancing.

[23:45] I'm gonna keep on dancing.

[23:46] I'm gonna keep on dancing.

[23:47] I'm gonna keep on dancing.

[23:48] I'm gonna keep on dancing.

[23:49] I'm gonna keep on dancing.

[23:56] Let's start paying attention to breast when it matters the most.

[23:59] Early detection for breast cancer is a game changer.

[24:02] The y-mate would be here today.

[24:04] So let's give more women's spring than ever before.

[24:07] Go to yourtitchenplease.com and take the first step.

[24:11] Big picture obviously grabbed attention.

[24:13] I mean, I would say 10 at 10 on the attention grabbing, right?

[24:16] That's evolutionary.

[24:17] And so the opposite demonstrate that the whole way through.

[24:19] I think that's good.

[24:20] They show some pop culture references.

[24:22] They show some influencers in there.

[24:24] They show some actors.

[24:25] All that stuff gains attention.

[24:26] I bet you people were watching this whole thing.

[24:28] All the way through.

[24:29] Like I was glued.

[24:31] Calm down.

[24:32] But the tone shifted at the end.

[24:34] I think basically you have a testimonial,

[24:36] which is fundamentally what that is.

[24:37] And I do think there's a decent juxtaposition with the text there.

[24:40] I wanna give this a B plus.

[24:42] I don't think it's an A, but I think it's a B plus.

[24:44] I think it was an above average ad.

[24:46] So they had, you know, their main point.

[24:48] And then they had a CTA at the end.

[24:50] I would say the urgency is implied with the fact

[24:52] that like you could have something over six million people

[24:54] have this bad thing happen.

[24:55] Don't be one of them is kind of the implied messaging.

[24:57] You know, I think that's good.

[24:58] I mean, you could model that ad structure for just about any business.

[25:01] Basically tons of attention.

[25:02] Fact that makes someone uncomfortable.

[25:04] Testimony of somebody who avoided it using the service.

[25:06] CTA.

[25:07] Like that's fundamentally what we just went through.

[25:09] The only lingering question that I have is like,

[25:11] it was so fun.

[25:12] I wonder if it leaves you feeling good.

[25:14] Not feeling like I should go and get my breast screening.

[25:18] And so I think that it's like this is something that may get positive

[25:21] accolades.

[25:22] Obviously, because who's going to shit on a breast cancer ad.

[25:23] But from a purely advertising perspective,

[25:25] the point of advertising is obviously left people know about your stuff.

[25:28] But the point of persuasion is to change behavior.

[25:31] Right?

[25:32] And so I think my larger question is like,

[25:34] how many people actually go through with it as a result of this ad

[25:38] compared to maybe an ad that could have been?

[25:41] Like, I think if they had done like the Google Gemini version ad of this,

[25:45] where it was like all the moments you're going to miss out on life,

[25:47] like probably would have been more compelling.

[25:49] Seconds maybe like the Jeep version of like,

[25:51] you know, boobs are freedom, like free the Tata's,

[25:53] but then all of a sudden it, you know, it transitions.

[25:55] Here's all the things that boobs are great for,

[25:57] but then it's just like somebody on a ventilator.

[25:59] I think that would have been more compelling to get people to like,

[26:02] change behavior.

[26:03] So I will put it as a as a big.

[26:05] Next one, Nike, let's hit it.

[26:09] You can't be demanding.

[26:11] You can't be relentless.

[26:13] You can't put yourself first.

[26:15] So, put yourself first.

[26:18] You can't be confident.

[26:20] So be confident.

[26:22] You can't challenge.

[26:24] So challenge.

[26:25] You can't dominate.

[26:27] So dominate.

[26:28] You can't flex.

[26:30] So flex.

[26:31] You can't feel a stadium.

[26:34] So feel that stadium.

[26:36] You can't be emotional.

[26:38] So be emotional.

[26:40] You can't take credit.

[26:42] You can't speak up.

[26:43] You can't be so ambitious.

[26:44] You can't break credit.

[26:45] You can't have any fun.

[26:46] You can't make the hands.

[26:47] You can't keep scoring.

[26:48] You can't stand out.

[26:49] Whatever you do, you can't win.

[26:51] So win.

[26:54] So win.

[26:59] So win.

[27:07] Well, you know I'm going to be a fan of anything that has just win.

[27:11] So that's Alex's life motto.

[27:14] More so that all the difficulties you go through can be rewritten with a W.

[27:18] You know, I'm a big fan of winners right history including your own.

[27:21] If you live your entire life suffering and then at the very end you accomplish what you wanted.

[27:26] I think that it would change the entire narrative.

[27:28] There's a great story that I heard of a guy who was objectively a failure and they just name all the failures the sky had.

[27:33] And the one thing he had is he wrote this little song called Jingle Bells.

[27:37] And so like failed musician failed and everything, but it's like he won.

[27:43] You know what I mean?

[27:44] I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean

[28:14] they're associating their brand with these people whom you like and they're wearing the product and demonstrating what it looks like to win.

[28:21] I would say this is a really solid ad.

[28:22] Obviously targeted at women since it's all female.

[28:25] I'll say this. This isn't my favorite Nike ad. I'm also not a woman.

[28:29] I'll give this an A. You got to put your hat on for associations. They're saying Nike equals winning and Nike equals doing what people told you you can't do.

[28:39] And I think that they would probably want those two associations.

[28:41] And Nike equals all of these great ladies that you like and that you admire and look up to.

[28:47] Therefore, to approximate your proximity to them, you then buy their product to feel that way when you put it on.

[28:54] So I think I think it was a successful, you know, branding marketing.

[28:58] And there's some of the best marketers. I mean, if you think about it as a brand perspective, I think Nike is one of the premier in terms of their understanding of building brand.

[29:06] But I'm very happy that they have come back and talked about winning again because I think they were touched with a touch of the the woe kism for a minute there.

[29:15] And I'm just glad that came back to reality. Nike is the, I think it's the Roman word for the goddess of victory.

[29:20] If you're going to be a brand built on winning, it means there has to be losers.

[29:24] You can't say that everybody's a winner and then also have a brand that's about winning because if everybody's a winner, no one is.

[29:30] That is a quote from Flash from the Incredibles, the cartoon.

[29:34] All right, next up, Rocket Mortgage. This should be interesting.

[30:04] Let's make a very special word. Yeah, I think we could do it.

[30:34] Super good ad. So they have basically, I would say a combination of like three quarters, Google Gemini, 25% Jeep and just made it.

[30:47] And so fundamentally, let's let's walk through the associations here, right?

[30:51] I would say this is an A plus, but not S tier and I'll explain why.

[30:55] So let's just walk through the associations really quickly. So they have what I would call humanity human moments that many people associate with.

[31:03] And slash Americana, all right, which is just basically the American ethos.

[31:08] And so they basically have this big, they basically build this huge storyboard of of the American ethos, right? American dream.

[31:15] They talk with the military, going home, different parts of the US, different sub segments.

[31:20] They clearly lean a little bit more in the direction of first time homeowners, at least that's what I read, you know, when I, when I look at this ad, I think mostly first time at home homeowners.

[31:29] Now, they may find out that getting them, getting for some homeowners, then creates the lifetime value of the customers.

[31:34] So that might have been deliberate. I don't know. The only knock I have on this ad is that the CTA was so short at the end that I didn't know who's at it was.

[31:43] So basically, it's like, they basically spent the whole time listing all the things that were amazing.

[31:49] That I'm like, I agree with all of this. In the last like one second, just it says rocket.com on the screen.

[31:55] And I have to be paying attention to know rocket.com and to know it's a mortgage company.

[32:00] So that's, that's why this isn't S tier.

[32:03] In my opinion, like Google, like what separates this from Google's?

[32:06] Google, I think, had the exact same level of narrative, emotionality, sentiment, except they were demonstrating the product throughout the entire ad.

[32:13] You knew as a Google product, they showed them using it. Whereas here, it was much more morphism, more difficult to figure out what it was about.

[32:21] I do think the ad overall though would win the awards over the fields and only after the fact that we were like, oh, I love that ad.

[32:27] But they might have now positive sentiment towards rocket. It's possible.

[32:31] I just don't know how many people watched yours like, oh, I like this ad, but didn't know who the ad was kind of attributed to.

[32:36] So by and large, really strong ad, very, and obviously this will only resonate with people who resonate with the American dream.

[32:43] But if they're advertising and hearing during the Super Bowl, Super Bowl is almost as American as Apple Pie, right?

[32:47] It's the right time to have an American on a message.

[32:50] And I will say that part that I probably liked the most was they had a very strong link to the American dream.

[32:57] So they said, oh, the American dream.

[32:59] And so that was the only, like, I would say, Thai, like, if we had words, own owning a home, I would say that was the word that would link all of that to, you know, mortgages.

[33:09] But otherwise, I would say that it was in a plus, not ester.

[33:12] Yeah, if you like this kind of like breakdown of some of the brand, I have a whole keynote on how to reverse engineer and create your own brand and understand the elements that create association, how to strengthen them, how to broaden them, how to gain influence, reach, and ultimately directionality, which is the three elements of brand. If you're like, I don't know what that is, you definitely need to watch the video. Enjoy.

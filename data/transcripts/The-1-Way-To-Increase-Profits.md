[00:00] What's going on everyone?

[00:00] I'm going to be talking to you about one of my favorite topics,

[00:04] arbitrage.

[00:05] And so the first time I heard this word was actually

[00:09] in a fancy dinner I was sitting in.

[00:11] I don't know what's going on.

[00:13] And these dudes and finance were talking about derivatives

[00:15] and crazy stuff, right?

[00:16] They just kept saying arbitrage.

[00:18] I was like, what does it, you know?

[00:19] Like, finally, I was like, what does that mean?

[00:22] And they were like, oh, it's like,

[00:23] when you just take advantage of an inefficiency

[00:25] in a marketplace.

[00:26] And I was like, how?

[00:29] And so then they explained it to me.

[00:31] And they're like, well, it's sort of like when you go on eBay, right?

[00:34] And you can buy something for $5.

[00:37] And then you can take the same thing

[00:38] and then just go into Amazon and sell it for $50.

[00:42] What would be a big example?

[00:43] But you get the idea.

[00:44] Where you buy for $5 and you sell for $50.

[00:46] And it's because there's an inefficiency in a marketplace

[00:50] where there's, that's where the arbitrage happens.

[00:53] And so the definition of arbitrage is where you buy

[00:56] in one market, right?

[00:59] At one cost and then you sell in another market

[01:03] at another cost.

[01:04] So you sell high and you buy low.

[01:07] Pretty simple, right?

[01:08] Everyone understands that.

[01:09] I'm going to make sure that should make sense.

[01:10] And here's you in the middle making all your money being happy.

[01:13] Yeah, there's you.

[01:14] All right.

[01:14] So that is basically what arbitrage means.

[01:17] But the more I thought about this concept,

[01:20] the more I realized that all business is arbitrage.

[01:24] And how much you want to you make

[01:26] in the extent to which you crush it,

[01:29] will be dictated by how big the arbitrage is.

[01:32] Even if you think about basic business,

[01:33] a service business, you're buying labor in the labor market.

[01:38] This is market one.

[01:39] This is why this is important

[01:40] is that you're buying and selling

[01:41] between different markets.

[01:43] This was a point of nuance that I didn't understand

[01:45] when they first told me how this worked.

[01:46] And I also didn't want to ask because I was embarrassed

[01:49] that I didn't know that I made.

[01:51] So hopefully you can watch this and not be embarrassed

[01:52] if someone says it.

[01:54] So a market one in market two.

[01:55] So there's an inefficiency.

[01:56] This little line here is the inefficiency

[01:59] between the market place.

[02:00] What you're buying at what you're selling at, right?

[02:02] And so market one can be a labor market.

[02:05] You're buying labor at X price.

[02:06] And you know that you can sell the labor

[02:08] at another price to market two.

[02:10] And then that's how you make a profit.

[02:12] But every business fundamentally works this way.

[02:15] I can buy from a manufacturer for a dollar

[02:17] and sell it over and market over market number two

[02:19] for $5.

[02:21] Now, and even the manufacturer buys from raw ingredient

[02:24] producers who buy it from farmers at $1

[02:28] and sell it for $5.

[02:29] And so that's the game that continues

[02:31] it's played between market one and market two.

[02:33] And a supply chain is literally a series of markets

[02:38] in a row of markets buying and selling, buying and selling.

[02:42] And then the person in the middle of the business owner

[02:44] is technically arbitraging all of these things, right?

[02:47] Right.

[02:47] Okay.

[02:48] Now, here's where I think this is interesting.

[02:52] So take this concept, pocket it,

[02:54] and your mind for a second.

[02:56] And so one of the concepts that I've tried to explain

[02:58] and I'm partially making this video

[03:00] so that I know that I learn things better when I teach them.

[03:03] So it's the difference between economic profits

[03:06] and accounting profits.

[03:07] If anyone took economics, if you did, right?

[03:10] Then they would talk about this.

[03:12] And the difference, I'll start with accounting profits

[03:14] because it's the easier one understand.

[03:16] They're not hard to understand, but it's the easier.

[03:19] So economic profits for accounting.

[03:21] Accounting profits are revenues minus all costs, right?

[03:25] That is an accounting profit, right?

[03:27] That's what most of us do when we do our tax returns,

[03:29] that is an accounting profit.

[03:32] Simple, I've wish it understood though.

[03:34] And an economic profit is where you take the revenue,

[03:38] minus the explicit cost of doing business,

[03:42] and then you also subtract out the opportunity cost,

[03:45] which is the implicit cost of using the resources

[03:48] that you have in that particular market

[03:51] or path versus another opportunity.

[03:54] So let me give you an example.

[03:55] So let's say you own a paper mill, right?

[04:00] And your company owned a forest,

[04:02] and that's where they cut the trees down,

[04:03] and then they turned it into paper, right?

[04:04] Simple.

[04:06] Now the economic profits of that business,

[04:09] the opportunity cost that would be factored

[04:11] into that economic profit, is whether or not

[04:14] you could make more money just selling timber, right?

[04:16] We're selling sawdust or selling wood.

[04:19] Those would be different examples of things

[04:21] that you could do with the existing resources you have,

[04:24] which is this guy in the middle here,

[04:26] he's got resources, he's got people,

[04:27] he's got maybe equipment, skill sets talent, et cetera,

[04:32] that if you were to apply those skills to a different market,

[04:37] he could then make more money.

[04:39] And that is the difference between economic profits

[04:41] and accounting profits.

[04:42] And the reason this is important to me,

[04:44] as a no-ch printer, is that when I'm looking at

[04:46] what I want to get into, right,

[04:48] with things that are interesting to me,

[04:49] or for investing, because I'm investing in business now,

[04:52] which is kind of wild to me.

[04:54] But anyways, is that I'm looking,

[04:56] is this given these resources of humans and skills

[05:00] and equipment and software and everything,

[05:02] we're currently pursuing arbitrage opportunity A, right?

[05:07] But what if, with these same skills,

[05:12] I could have arbitrage opportunity B,

[05:16] where I'm buying in this market for rock bottom prices,

[05:19] and there's another market over here

[05:21] that is paying top dollar, right?

[05:24] So between the first example,

[05:26] I have where it's a normal amount of money that's being made,

[05:29] compared to this arbitrage opportunity,

[05:32] I would want to be in this one, right?

[05:35] Now, what's going to dictate

[05:37] whether or not it's going to be one of these markets,

[05:38] versus one of these markets?

[05:40] Well, the growth of the marketplace, overall,

[05:43] there are growing markets, like online fitness,

[05:45] is a growing market, right?

[05:47] And so that means that there's likely,

[05:50] going to be arbitrage, a greater degree of arbitrage

[05:55] because there's going to be more demand.

[05:57] And so if I can find a market where I feel like there's more

[06:00] to man, for the same things that I can buy cheaply,

[06:03] then I want to go to those things.

[06:05] And so when I'm thinking about all opportunities,

[06:07] because I think that that's one of the biggest superpowers

[06:09] that we have to have is entrepreneurs,

[06:10] is not sure.

[06:12] Like right now, I could go and run a gym and make money.

[06:14] I could also run a massage part, learn make money.

[06:16] I could also run a sub-encombity make money.

[06:19] I do that too, right?

[06:20] I could run a lot of different businesses to make money.

[06:22] But of all the opportunities under the sun

[06:24] of all the different ways I could make money,

[06:25] which is the best given my resource

[06:29] to skills, talent, team, et cetera.

[06:32] And then if I look at all of those things on board,

[06:34] these are the things that were absolutely amazing, right?

[06:36] And these are the different arbitrage opportunities

[06:39] that exist, which of these arbitrage opportunities

[06:42] will be best fit for the skills, talents, traits, team, et cetera,

[06:46] that I have.

[06:48] And then by answering that question,

[06:49] will inherently answer the very important question,

[06:51] which is, what can we be the best in the world at?

[06:54] And so I think for me, this has been a really valuable concept

[06:57] to understand, is that all businesses arbitrage,

[06:59] it all functions off of an information advantage

[07:02] between the buyer and the seller.

[07:05] The seller always has the information advantage,

[07:08] or many times, has the information advantage.

[07:11] And so fundamentally, when you find out

[07:14] that an iPhone cost $17 to make, people are shocked by this.

[07:17] But that's because there's obviously other cost

[07:20] besides the manufacturing, obviously.

[07:22] But all big businesses run off

[07:24] of extraordinary degrees of arbitrage, right?

[07:27] Facebook is able to have eyeballs and sell eyeballs

[07:31] at a significant amount cheaper than it cost them to manufacture them,

[07:34] right?

[07:35] Right.

[07:36] And Verizon, it costs them pennies to add another user

[07:39] to their base.

[07:40] And so the reason this is important for me

[07:42] to at least express is that for a very long time,

[07:44] when I was earlier on in my career,

[07:47] I had these weird morals and ethics around

[07:49] how much more I could charge for something.

[07:51] And the reality is, there is no limit.

[07:52] It is simply based on the market demand.

[07:54] And so whether it cost you a penny

[07:56] to make something that's worth $1,000,

[07:58] or it cost you a penny to make something worth two pennies,

[08:00] that price that you charge should never be

[08:03] in any way relation to what it cost you.

[08:04] And only related to what the market will allow.

[08:08] And then it's up to us as entrepreneurs

[08:09] to look at which arbitrage opportunities

[08:11] exist between marketplaces that best fit our skill sets.

[08:15] And by doing that, we will then find ourselves

[08:17] in the best opportunity vehicle for us

[08:19] to grow in a long term and probably make the most money.

[08:22] So anyways, I hope that was all I before you.

[08:25] I hope this made sense for me.

[08:25] This is a topic that I love talking about.

[08:28] And I hope that you find value in that.

[08:31] And otherwise, have an amazing day.

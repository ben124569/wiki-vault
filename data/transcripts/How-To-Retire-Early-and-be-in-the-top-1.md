[00:00] What's going on everyone I've got a special presentation for you guys today?

[00:02] This has been on my mind for probably about half a week now and it's gonna be about money

[00:08] All right everybody's favorite topic and it's probably not gonna be what you think it's gonna be but it's gonna be really good promise

[00:14] So one of the things of this top of mind is that I get a lot of conversations from entrepreneurs who are like I just want to be the top 1%

[00:20] And I want to and the thing is is

[00:24] The people who are in the top 1% live a different way and they also don't live now the way they did

[00:30] To get here all right and so I'll tell you quick story and then I'm gonna show you what I mean with this beautiful pyramid

[00:35] And if you're listening then I'll try and explain it visually or audio wise

[00:39] So when I was very early on in my career

[00:43] Earlier to the now right I was

[00:48] Showing up to a mastermind event that I had it was the first mastermind event

[00:51] I think we had 28 people who were showing up and all these people were paying

[00:55] 40,000 dollars a year and I remember pulling up to our event. It was an Albuquerque

[01:00] New Mexico and

[01:03] They were walking into the hotel as I was pulling up right and I was like nervous and excited and all that stuff and

[01:09] One of the one of the girls moniker guitar

[01:14] Was like as we're getting out of the car. She was like I thought you guys were supposed to be rich

[01:19] And she literally said that and I've still remember to this day because it was like such a moment for me

[01:24] I don't even know if she remembers it but

[01:26] We were pulling up in a preest that had a crack across the windshield and a dent in the side door

[01:32] All right, and this car was probably a 6,000 dollar car tops, right and the thing is is at that moment

[01:38] I was a millionaire like I had a million dollars in cash, right?

[01:42] Sitting my big account after taxes and yet I was driving a 6,000 dollar car and so one of the things that I consistently see

[01:49] Is people outliving their means and this is that's not a new message

[01:53] But for some reason it still doesn't resonate with people and so I'm gonna level up this conversation a little bit

[01:59] Because you're like the way deluxe. I thought you now have a Bentley which I totally regret by the way

[02:03] But I do have a Bentley and we have a very nice home the thing is is

[02:08] A Bentley for me relative to my income is less than one week's income for me

[02:13] income

[02:15] And so one of the important things to understand is the relative cost of any of anything that you have and so I

[02:23] Have always used this back of napkin math to justify

[02:27] Expenses all right, and so as a result of that I always have lived on less than 5% once I started making money less than 5% of

[02:35] What I made which pretty much meant that until I was making a million dollars a year more

[02:39] I lived on 30,000 dollars a year

[02:41] All right, which is if you've heard my other story about once Leyland I made our first 100,000 dollars

[02:45] I told her this is awesome that means that we have three years of living if we make no more money

[02:51] All right because we knew that on on

[02:54] $1,500 a month we could live right decently comfortably and

[02:59] I'll tell you this comfort's nice, but there's not that much more enjoyment

[03:03] You get out of like driving a Bentley versus a normal car and I'm sure there's car people who are like whatever

[03:06] But I'll tell you that the incremental gain that I have in my life is not worth the money

[03:09] It's probably the last expense of Carl Agra have is also the first really expensive car that we ever got

[03:15] But

[03:16] What I wanted to do though and kind of shift the conversation is not just talk about you know making

[03:21] Spending a lot less than you make because I saw somebody recently who is one of our clients

[03:25] They graduated from the program and then they went on to start an online business. They were Jim owner

[03:29] and I saw the expenses that they were incurring and I was like man

[03:34] Like

[03:36] That worries me you know what I mean it just it worries me because I see a lack of judgment

[03:43] Because you don't know how things are gonna change I mean I think of the last year for anyone

[03:46] You can say that things can change quickly and I want to have tons of dry powder tons of reserves to pull on if I need them

[03:52] And so for me I get more anxiety by having expenses and so for me to actually lower by

[03:58] Exieties I lower how much I spend and so if that's something that you can associate for yourself as in the less money

[04:03] I spend the more relaxed I am

[04:05] Then I would encourage you do it because for me it's been one of my kind of secret sauces

[04:09] Of successes just like just don't spend a ton of money

[04:12] Especially relative to what you make and so what I want to do for the rest of this is kind of first

[04:17] Talk about what it looks like to get in the top one percent and then how to get there all right

[04:22] So right here you've got a pyramid and if you're listening

[04:25] Then you can listen along but there's four layers to this pyramid all right

[04:29] And this is kind of the top one percent pyramid the bottom layer of this is people who have these are considered high net worth individuals

[04:36] All right, that means you have one to five million dollars in assets

[04:40] All right now this may surprise you but the people at this level and I've got my notes here

[04:46] So I'm going along with this in the United States it's one in 69

[04:52] So one in 69 people is

[04:55] Is between one in five million dollars so being over a million is not even top one percent anymore

[05:00] I mean it sort of is but like

[05:03] It technically it's a little like if you actually had one million dollars you wouldn't be in the one percent

[05:07] But I find that but that's in assets not income

[05:11] Right that's an assets not income

[05:14] You don't need to make a million dollars a year to be in the top one percent

[05:17] Right and what's crazy to me is that the top one percent income is

[05:21] 400,000 year but the top one percent in assets is only a million or a million and half bucks

[05:28] How nuts is that it means people spend all their money?

[05:33] That's what that means so if you have a top one percent income

[05:36] You should be way above the top one percent in assets

[05:40] But it doesn't work that way because people always want to show off and people can't think long term and the only thing that I've been

[05:46] Continually reading about because of it's really pouring a lot into it really reading a lot about munger and

[05:52] And buff it so Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger who

[05:56] Founders and one of Berkshire, halfway

[05:59] Is how they live and how they think in terms of long term and so I'm gonna transition to talking about how to get there

[06:05] But I'm gonna finish this little chart for you

[06:06] So this is the top one point five percent roughly of the US is one to five million in assets and that's one in 69

[06:14] So if I for me, I like the one in personally and make some more real for me

[06:17] So one in 69 people all right now in the US the next level is

[06:22] Very high networks you go high net worth to very high net worth individual for this it's point three percent

[06:30] All right of people

[06:31] That's crazy now here's what it is in math that's one in

[06:36] 338 so one in

[06:38] 338 people is which worth between five and 30 million dollars. That's what they have in investable assets five and 30 million dollars

[06:49] I'm purposely putting this out there to hopefully counter the Instagram culture of flexing in front of a Lamborghini or

[06:56] Bentley right whatever because most people are broke

[07:00] Like most people are poor and I think that I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna lay out a

[07:06] A plan for you that's very simple to get you above this to really just be in the top one percent and the thing is is like I said

[07:13] The top one percent income earners are over 420,000 or 440,000 year depending on where you're looking

[07:20] That's per year so for you to get over five million

[07:24] Like you just need to live on a lot less than you make if you were in the top one percent income earners

[07:29] You should be in this five to 30 million dollars within not a ton of time

[07:34] Right and then the the level above that is ultra high net worth individuals

[07:40] Which is one in 13

[07:44] 83 and that's what is that that's

[07:49] 0.07 percent all right points 0.7 percent right and then finally I'll just finish this little chart out

[07:57] billionaires is a one in

[08:00] 468000

[08:02] All right and and the percentage there is point

[08:06] 0 0 0

[08:08] 4 0s

[08:10] 3 zeros 3 zeros 2 percent all right now the reason that the jump between the the third stage and the fourth stage is so large

[08:17] That the range is between 30 and a billion so everyone that's good to be got between 30 and a billion is in the next level

[08:24] And then billionaires that is the fourth category

[08:26] So these are the kind of like the the four layers above the one percent the very first layer kind of gets you into the top

[08:32] One percent more or less right and then a above that you have the very categories

[08:38] The thing is is that in order for you to get to a above five million dollars

[08:43] And not even top one percent the top point three percent

[08:46] All right one in 338 so you walk in term the student 30 people you're probably the richest person in the room

[08:54] For you to do that you got to save like 15 grand a year

[08:59] For 30 years

[09:01] That's it and that's assuming just 9 percent returns which is just the stock market

[09:06] Right just put in the S&P 500 and don't do anything with it right that's not doing crypto that's not that's not that's not learning how to like it's literally just

[09:16] Save up you know 1200 dollars a month and put it into the S&P and do it every month

[09:22] That's it if you make 400 thousand dollars a year

[09:25] She making 35 thousand dollars month right if you live on five you can put ten thousand dollars and you'll be

[09:31] It you'll be at the top end of this right but everyone just spend so much money and so I

[09:40] Just when I see this it's both incredibly encouraging to me and it also incredibly saddening

[09:46] It's encouraging to me because I feel like genuinely everyone can get to the top one percent which doesn't make math mathematical sense

[09:52] But it makes it makes realistic sense and you feel like put Alex

[09:56] How do I how do I save 1200 dollars a month right so it's two things it's income and time

[10:02] Right net income being like minus your expenses so it means it's make more money spend less money

[10:07] The easiest thing most people do is they just spend too much money right and I know that sometimes you can like it's sometimes

[10:14] A parent depending if you like all my Instagram or whatever, but like

[10:16] Laylen I think I was asking for her to give me the numbers from last year, but we live on less than five percent of what we make

[10:24] All right, and you're like, well, sure, that's because you make a lot. Yeah, but I lived on that when I made nothing

[10:28] Right and so I think most people like you should live on 30 grand 40 grand a year and the thing is is that you already know

[10:35] In your heart that meant spent making that spending more of the money is not going to make you happier

[10:40] I'll tell you right now. It's not and if the point of spending money is to make you happier

[10:45] I'm telling you it's not sure like I have this studio

[10:49] I can justify this business expense

[10:52] But I did this mostly because I enjoyed and to me from a from a percentage of income

[10:57] It's negligible right and so I got this fancy setup only after I had already crossed three of these levels

[11:05] Right I'm saying this because it just frustrates me because I really believe anyone can do it

[11:13] I really do you just have to live on a lot less than you make and so anyways to to finish this out

[11:19] Right, what do you do most times you're going to have to sell something right either you're selling someone else's product or you're selling your own product

[11:26] Either way, and by I say product I mean product service whatever, right, but either one of those categories and if you make a hundred thousand dollars a year

[11:33] 100 thousand dollars a year and you live on 30 you can do this

[11:36] Not only can you get into this bought a cool bottom level the top one percent but you can in the top point three percent

[11:42] Right now a part of you's like well

[11:45] You know that then what's what's the point of living it really depends on on what you value

[11:52] If like and this is kind of backwards because it's like the type of person who wants to have more money wants to spend the money

[11:56] They have then I can understand it but then at that point just don't yearn for more

[12:02] That makes sense so like don't be dissatisfied that you haven't achieved your role for me

[12:06] What I'm looking at is like how can I get into this category by the time I die

[12:10] And use that to impact humanity like in a way that's that's meaningful

[12:15] That's what I'm that's what I'm trying to do right and so

[12:19] Anyways, I told you the prehistory to illustrate a point which is I was a millionaire and living a less than three thousand dollars a month

[12:25] Right I own to my car our rent was 1200 bucks and Lailin I lived on

[12:31] We we bought food of the grocery store you know what I mean like we did we went out once a week like it wasn't it like you can do that in live a normal life

[12:38] Like a comfortable life and

[12:40] That was when we were making a lot of money and that's because I always have a fear or had a fear that

[12:45] I would it I was like what happens if we stop making money

[12:47] I don't I just don't want to lose everything and so I think if you can be satisfied and decrease your anxiety or make the amount that you spend

[12:55] Decreation anxiety you will be happier so I'm gonna leave you with this one piece as a final note on this

[13:02] Which is the simple retirement calculator all right world simplest retirement calculator

[13:07] so

[13:10] If you live let's say let's say that you are currently 30 years old all right, so you're currently 30

[13:18] And you want to retire all right, so let's say you want to retire soon

[13:24] Let's say you want to retire by the time you're 40 all right crazy shit

[13:27] You're gonna try and retire by 40 okay cool. I dig it

[13:30] So if you're gonna retire by I'm safer tired, but realistically you're gonna work because you like working

[13:34] But let's just say that you won't you don't want to have to work you don't work on this stuff you like working on after your 40 cool no problem

[13:42] The percentage of your income that you spend is going to be the thing that dictates how quickly you can retire

[13:49] Not how much you make so for example if you make $400,000 a year like I said right and

[13:57] You save 10% right

[14:02] Versus making a hundred thousand dollars a year

[14:05] And you saving let's say 80% is what you save

[14:11] Then what's your what you every year you're adding four years of retirement because it means that you're spending 20 and

[14:20] Saving 80 K

[14:22] Woo, that's great. Let me say for every year you're getting four years back

[14:26] Which means if in 10 years at this point you have 40 more years

[14:31] Right once you hit 40 because you had 10 years of stockpiling four each year right you'd have 40 years of living now

[14:38] Mind you that's assuming it's your current level and that the money that you now have saved up at this point because you should have 800,000 right

[14:44] And that's assuming that none of the money you had made any money

[14:47] So it'd probably be closer to like 1.2 right million by the end of that decade

[14:51] That's really conservative though. Maybe even two million right at that point that this money isn't even making you money

[14:56] That's just literally assuming a straight decrease in how much you spend right that every year

[15:02] It would just go down which isn't even realistic right but if you did that then you'd get there and that's 100 grand a year

[15:08] Right, that's it

[15:10] On the flip side if you're at this 10% guy then every year he gets one tenth of a year

[15:15] Right because you saving 40 and cost him 400 to do a year

[15:18] Which means that this guy is never really gonna be able to retire right and he's always gonna be stressed

[15:22] Where she's always gonna be stressed and so I say that only to illustrate one point which is you have to spend less than you make

[15:31] It's sometimes this is simple shit people don't want to do and it means that you can either have your ego and how you look to everyone

[15:37] Or you can have your ego based on the freedom that you feel and I know that the vast majority people will never do that

[15:42] I get messages every day from people who are like

[15:45] You know they've been trying for 10 years to make a million dollars a year rather than maybe trying to make

[15:50] 100 thousand dollars first right and the thing is is to be in this top one percent

[15:55] You don't need to make a million dollars a year not even close

[15:58] You're not even close anymore you don't even need to make close to a million dollars a year to be in the top one percent

[16:03] Right if you just add a little bit of time

[16:06] You can get in the top one percent just being reasonable

[16:08] Right you can get in the top point three percent by also being a you know unreestable be compared to everyone else

[16:15] Right just because the thing is is most people are insane

[16:20] In terms of their irrational with their behavior and their expenditures they are stressed about the amount of money

[16:25] They spend and yet they are the complete control of how much they spend just spend less and you'll be less stressed

[16:32] So anyways

[16:33] That is my money money message for everyone today

[16:37] We still continue to less on live on you know 5% maybe 10% of what we make

[16:42] I don't think we live on 10% we live on 5% of what we make and thing is is like at that point

[16:47] If you live on if you live in 5% or 10% of what you make then it means that literally one year if you like walk walk with me for a second

[16:55] If you live on 10% of what you make and your money grows at 10% then in one year you could retire

[17:03] Assuming you have a stable income from the the savings that you had on the other 90 right

[17:07] Figurably one year 15 months whatever, but you get the idea right

[17:11] Does that make sense to everybody like if you live on 10% of what you make or you live on like you're like

[17:16] But man that's like poverty levels. It's like

[17:18] Yes, but

[17:20] It's poverty levels in your mind based on your perception

[17:23] Not based on reality of the fact that you're gonna be stockpiling money that will continue to feed you forever along you want

[17:30] Right, and so the more of the story is

[17:34] Spend less than you make though the greater you can create that disparity the faster you can retire or get to a point where you choose to work on the things that only you want to work on

[17:43] Right

[17:45] And getting into the top one percent is literally a matter of saving a

[17:49] 1,500 bucks a month and putting in the S&P 500

[17:53] It's about it

[17:54] It's all or I mean like that's that's it. It's all there is to it and the thing is is it's so simple

[18:01] No, and we'll do it

[18:03] That's okay, but you're smart cookie and you're gonna do it because

[18:06] You think that simple things are usually the keys to the universe which I agree with you

[18:11] So keeping awesome lots of love and I'll catch you guys on the flip side

[18:15] Bye

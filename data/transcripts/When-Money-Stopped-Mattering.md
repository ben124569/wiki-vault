[00:00] Welcome to the call today.

[00:01] I want to open the floor up to ask you guys,

[00:06] because I'm sure because it's been 30 days since last time we spoke.

[00:09] So if you guys have questions in the chat,

[00:11] burning things, decisions that are impending,

[00:14] things you're unsure about, strategies that you need to validate,

[00:17] or even just a verbal high five, please put in the chat.

[00:21] I'll go and go in from top to bottom

[00:23] and then I'll rock and roll from there.

[00:25] Mr. Piment, question that leans on for what's up,

[00:28] who made you go, like, I'm like,

[00:31] sure, let's rock in. Let's do it.

[00:35] So in your podcast, you talk a lot about how happiness is like the equation

[00:43] of like, wants versus needs and like,

[00:46] I have a million cash in the bank,

[00:47] but I was living off of 30 grand or something like that.

[00:51] And so where you, have you always just been predisposed to wanting

[00:56] less or is that like a skill that you learn?

[00:58] Because most people are like, yeah, I want to make millions and millions

[01:02] of dollars for that. I can get more, at least that's kind of like where

[01:06] I was the direction I was going until I like,

[01:08] so I listen to you and now I'm thinking like,

[01:09] I'm like, you know, and so I'm just curious to know,

[01:12] like, if that was just like a natural, like predisposition that you had

[01:16] or you like got to a certain point to where you're like,

[01:20] okay, now that I've experienced more, I want less,

[01:24] but I've had it that all kind of played out because I think it would help me

[01:28] become more happy.

[01:30] Man, that's a loaded question. It has probably been what that question is

[01:33] been the primary thing that's occupied my mind space in the last 18 months.

[01:38] And so for context, I don't talk as much probably about what we do,

[01:41] but like between our all of the companies that we own,

[01:44] we're doing just under two million a week.

[01:46] Like I don't need to take these calls, right?

[01:49] I do these things because like there are a few things that I drive joy from.

[01:53] Like I love, you know, like I like hearing Peter's updates.

[01:55] I like hearing Patrick knowing that he's used to use these moving,

[01:58] you know, forwarding the car practice business.

[01:59] And Jason's finally getting his fucking legion.

[02:02] Find a set up and Mac, you're doing your own days thing,

[02:05] which is sick, you know what I mean?

[02:06] And Michael, I remember your first sale, like that is where I find meaning.

[02:10] And so I think first off, if you redefine the term from happiness,

[02:13] which is, which is based on outside circumstances,

[02:16] you are happy as a reaction.

[02:17] Joy comes from within, which means that I can be sad and

[02:20] sorrowful and filled with joy.

[02:21] You can mourn and be joyful because joyful is how you choose to experience

[02:26] the circumstances.

[02:27] So first I would redefine the word that you're shooting for, right?

[02:31] The second thing is asking like, but why?

[02:35] Right? And so a lot of us want to make money because we're like,

[02:38] I want to, you know, and then when we talk publicly, it's like,

[02:43] I want to leave a legacy, I want to leave an impact, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[02:46] Right? All that stuff. I want to help people.

[02:48] But the reality is that everything that you do, that is external achievement,

[02:53] is a femoral. And what it means is that literally only exists on the physical plane,

[02:57] and that physical plane is temporary, which means it will end, which means that all of the

[03:01] achievements and all the things that you're doing on this plane,

[03:04] literally by definition, will have no lasting impact.

[03:09] And so if it means that nothing that you do, any, all the things that you accomplish,

[03:13] and all the things or rather the wealth that you accumulate will eventually disappear,

[03:17] it changes the perspective somewhat. And so the way that I like to think about it is the

[03:21] analogy of a casino. And so I think all of us are given a token when we're, you know,

[03:26] when we come of age and start to get into the game, and we sit down at a table,

[03:30] and we play, and we play, and we play, and we play, and we play, and the players around the table are

[03:34] bragging about how big their chips are, some players win, some players lose, and more,

[03:38] more chips get stacked, right? But the difference between that casino and the casino of life is that

[03:44] at the end of the day, you leave the table with your chips still on it, and you don't cash out,

[03:48] and then everyone takes the chips that you had there. So you're playing a fake game with fake money.

[03:56] And so I think when you realize that like you can buy a castle, you can buy a house,

[04:03] and there's a person in India who has no shoes who has more joy in their life,

[04:09] real is that none of the things that we do to accomplish serve any real meaning whatsoever.

[04:14] They really just act as the shovel that we use to dig the holes that we're going to fill back

[04:20] up at the end of the day when we die. And so it's like, what shovel do you want to use to dig your hole?

[04:28] And so I like to think of those things as what things do I inherently find joy in?

[04:35] And so for me, I enjoy learning, and I learn through teaching, and so that is how I derive meaning.

[04:44] And the only thing that I can dedicate my life to that easy turnl are things that will last

[04:51] past the physical plane, which are values. And so if you can shift your decision-making process from

[04:58] outcome based decision-making process to value based decision-making process, you'll always feel

[05:02] in alignment with your identity. And so for me, when I experience alignment between what I truly

[05:10] believe, what I say and what I do, I feel like I'm acting in the way that I, that isn't alignment with

[05:16] who I am. And so I think that a lot of us have made decisions or say things that are contrary to what we

[05:21] believe, or we do things that are contrary to what we say, we do things contrary to what we think,

[05:25] and we experience dissonance, and that's most of our lives. And so I think that if you can

[05:29] free yourself into thinking, I can, I believe these things to be true. I say them with certainty,

[05:36] and my life is a reflection of those things, which I believe to be meaningful. And I can dedicate

[05:43] my life to that eternal value, and that value will exist after I die. And so that for me is,

[05:50] is kind of where I drive meaning for work. That was helpful. Yeah, I was a big, how have you

[06:02] defined your values, though? Did you sit on a stone, say, I value integrity and courage? And

[06:09] what does that look like and how does that play? I mean, obviously, if you do business, you're

[06:14] doing it with integrity and courage or whatever your values are, but like how do you innovate?

[06:20] What do you mean, I'm big? If you think about it, there's a lot of times where

[06:26] where we, we sacrifice, we cut a small corner, right? And so where we cut the small corners a lot of

[06:32] times is not anything that anyone else would notice, it's just that we know it. Like you make the

[06:38] email campaign, and you just know you didn't do your best. You just wanted to get it done,

[06:42] right? You made the ad and you didn't really go through the process that you know you should be going through.

[06:47] Right? You made the the VSL and you just tried to knock it out because it was on your to do list,

[06:51] rather than thinking like, I'm going to make this truly excellent. And so every time you do that,

[06:55] you live outside of the values that you have for yourself. And so I think that like you,

[07:01] you feel like you live an alignment when what you say to others about what you believe is actually

[07:07] what you do. And so yes, sure, we all believe in being honest. Sure, we all believe in trying

[07:12] hard. Sure, we all believe in doing your best. But no one fucking does.

[07:21] Man, I work everyone. I was like, good a fucking China where they work six days a week, 12 hours a day,

[07:27] and that is their 40 hour work week and tell me how hard you work. I worked the weekend.

[07:34] You're so hardcore. Right? And then why is working even considered something that's loudable?

[07:42] Right? A lot of them. Why is it? Why has that even anything? Because we're supposed to be doing

[07:46] things that we enjoy that we drive meaning from. So why should we be loud at for doing things that we

[07:50] find joy like that we derived joy? It's just interesting thoughts. But anyways, Michael, that's

[07:56] my, that's my two cents on it.

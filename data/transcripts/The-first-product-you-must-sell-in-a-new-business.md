[00:00] In this video, I'm going to talk to you about one of the questions that I get most frequently

[00:03] and that I want the problems that I have to solve again, most commonly in some of the companies

[00:07] that we take on in our portfolio.

[00:10] One of the goals of any business is to maximize the amount of revenue per customer you

[00:14] generate.

[00:15] A lot of times, you would have what's called a accommodating buying curve.

[00:20] That basically means is at every wrong, if someone is welfare, you want them to buy more

[00:27] money with you and if someone has less money, you want them to still buy from you, but

[00:31] potentially buy for less.

[00:33] This gives way to a lot of these crazy product and service listings where people will have

[00:40] 100 different services and products that they offer because they want to have the ability

[00:45] to serve everyone at the maximum degree.

[00:48] The thing is, is that most times that will create so much operational complexity and create

[00:54] so many little appendages, little sticky things that are stuck onto the side and bolted

[00:59] on and globbed and duct taped onto a business that it becomes incredibly distracting

[01:03] for all of the employees because they're thinking about all these different things.

[01:07] Here's a funny one.

[01:08] Is that most times, if your employees don't understand all the different types of things

[01:12] you sell in the price points you sell the man, your customers for sure don't.

[01:16] One of the things that we will do when we're looking at a company is we will simplify

[01:20] the product offering and instead try and reach the maximum buying threshold per prospect

[01:27] by changing the payment terms.

[01:30] Now, in a perfect world, if everyone had absolute information and everyone was unbelievably

[01:35] well trained and you had a great infrastructure and all that stuff then yes, the more

[01:39] products and services you offer in theory you would make more money.

[01:42] But we don't live in that theoretical world most of the time and most small business

[01:47] centers are not that good at operating.

[01:49] The number one issue they have, they're super disorganized, they feel like they're spinning

[01:52] the reals all day, their team completely has no idea which way they're going, they change

[01:57] things all the time, etc.

[01:58] And so in an effort to combat that we have used this process of when we're going to end

[02:03] it has worked very well.

[02:04] So, it is as follows.

[02:06] We sell two things and I've done this in virtually every business that I've ever owned.

[02:11] We sell two things, two products or two services and this is once we're going from one to

[02:16] 10 million.

[02:17] All right, zero to one million, you sell one product, one service, one avatar.

[02:19] All right, that's it.

[02:21] One channel, one product, one avatar.

[02:23] That's it.

[02:24] All right.

[02:25] But once you're going from one to, you know, one to three ish million and you're trying

[02:29] to go to ten, you introduce the second product line.

[02:33] And so here's how this works.

[02:34] If you have two things that you sell, you'll have a front and thing and you'll have

[02:37] a back and thing.

[02:38] We can still have a massive accommodation in the buying curve based on the payment terms that

[02:45] we introduce.

[02:46] So, for example, people will look at their monthly expense more than the total contract

[02:53] value.

[02:54] That's a huge money hack.

[02:55] Giving you right now, this is a wealth hack.

[02:57] This is something that will make you a fortune in your life if you can properly understand

[03:01] this.

[03:02] People do not look at the length or the total contract they're signing, they will only pay

[03:09] attention to what is it going to cost me every month because no one is good with their

[03:12] money.

[03:13] All right.

[03:14] Cash will spend month over month over month over month and they just think, can I make

[03:18] it happen?

[03:19] Yes, cool all sign.

[03:21] They don't think about the total contract value.

[03:23] For you as a business owner, the contract value matters almost more than anything.

[03:26] So I'll give you a quick hack on this, total side note, tangent for you, life hack.

[03:31] Pro tip, if you want to extend the contract value that you have, I have a saying which is

[03:36] the bigger the head, the longer the tail.

[03:37] All right.

[03:38] And so what that means is, the more you can get someone to pay up front and relative to the

[03:42] upfront cost of signing up or what they paid down, the lower their contractual recurring

[03:49] payment is, the stickier will be.

[03:51] So I'll give you an example.

[03:52] If I had someone signed up for $99 a month for whatever, it doesn't matter.

[03:56] That price point might be medium sticky depend on the value that I have.

[04:00] Now imagine, I had someone pay $5000 down and $99 a month after that.

[04:05] How much more sticky would it be?

[04:08] Significantly more sticky.

[04:09] Now the beauty is if you have one of these upfront type payments, you could also use that

[04:13] to liquidate your ad costs, cover your commissions for the salesperson, cover the upfront

[04:17] fulfillment and onboarding which is going to cost more for a new customer than an existing

[04:21] customer.

[04:22] And so you can build all that in.

[04:23] If you know that the thing that you are selling has very high gross margins, then you

[04:27] can still have a lower cost as long as you know that the person is going to stay for a

[04:31] long time.

[04:32] And so based on how you structure the pricing, you can actually get some, you can use the pricing

[04:35] to actually get people to stick longer.

[04:37] So the tip complete, that is it, moving back to the original thing that I'll talk about.

[04:41] In one of our portfolio companies, we actually had this as a really in-depth discussion

[04:44] that we had to make a decision about.

[04:46] And so they had a different mentor and person, whatever advice, and told them that they should

[04:51] have three products.

[04:53] And they should have a low, a medium and a high product and then based on what the sales

[04:57] would thought, the salesman would sell them, the low, medium or high.

[05:00] In my experience, it is not that effective.

[05:04] And that is because the salesperson can't decide which of these things they are trying

[05:08] to sell most of the time.

[05:10] And so what we have found is more effective is you give the salesperson the one dreamed

[05:14] to sell.

[05:15] This thing is going to solve this person's problem and we make it the most valuable thing

[05:18] that we're trying to sell because at the end of the day, you do want to solve the customer's

[05:22] problem.

[05:23] We do want to actually make sure that we're writing value rather than having a diet, a medium,

[05:27] and a great, simply having one thing that solves all the problems and then based on the

[05:33] customer's budget, we can decrease how they pay.

[05:38] So here we go.

[05:39] So let's say that we want to do a, this is a six month implementation of whatever kind

[05:45] of solution you sell.

[05:46] If you have a six month duration, you can have the person a pay the entire thing up front.

[05:51] So that would be for somebody who has the highest budget.

[05:54] Version two would be a split pay.

[05:57] Version three might be three payments, right, with at 20% higher.

[06:00] And then finally you might have a, have a, you know, a six pay or whatever over that

[06:04] period of time.

[06:05] So one two three six.

[06:07] Now here's the cool thing.

[06:08] The more payment options you provide, the higher conversions are.

[06:12] That's proven.

[06:13] All right.

[06:14] So the more options you give someone to pay, the more people will buy.

[06:18] Period.

[06:19] Now you might not make more cash flow because if you give your sales guy more options, then

[06:23] they might use the, the end of defaulting to the lower ones, right.

[06:26] But if you have one thing to sell, then they only have one thing to convince the

[06:31] person up because it confused mind doesn't buy.

[06:34] If you have too many options, the salesman won't know what to sell and the prospect won't

[06:37] know what to buy.

[06:38] And so I prefer when I'm becoming a top or fully company, I'm thinking, what is this true

[06:44] problem that we are solving with this business for what avatar?

[06:47] And we make that the main thing and we communicate it clearly in the scripting and the sales

[06:52] person has clarity on what they are selling and they're always solving the same thing.

[06:56] So the question becomes no longer which of these things are you going to buy?

[07:02] But once you are buying, how would you like to pay?

[07:05] And so then the discussion is around what payment plan is best for them rather than what

[07:09] product is best for them.

[07:10] And so by doing that, you can get people to go between different payment terms, that is

[07:15] not going to change whether they're going to buy.

[07:16] But if they're unsure about which product is going to best suit their needs and the salesman

[07:20] doesn't know because the end of the day, he's just trying to sell the most expensive

[07:23] thing, then you'll have way more confused people who leave on sold.

[07:27] So this is a single tactic that you can use to execute within your business, which is

[07:30] why I have a big fan of making offers people cannot say no to, is that you can focus all

[07:34] of your sales and all of your persuasion attempts on selling the one thing, which is getting

[07:38] them to say yes.

[07:39] Once they say yes, we can reach, we can accommodate their wealth and their budget based

[07:44] on the payment terms that we provide.

[07:46] And if we have done a wee of structured or offer properly, the offer in and of itself should

[07:50] already be very high gross margins, which means whether or not the person pays a thousand

[07:54] dollars a month or a hundred dollars a month, it's still almost all margin for us because

[07:58] of how we structure the thing that we are selling.

[08:00] And so we are able to capture higher LTVs by getting the people who have more money to

[08:06] prepay the thing upfront.

[08:08] That is how we do it.

[08:10] And with those people, you'll be able to ascend into the second thing faster because

[08:15] they've already prepaid that thing and then you can solve the next natural problem in

[08:19] another sales conversation rather than trying to pick all of the things in one conversation,

[08:24] which makes it incredibly difficult to do.

[08:27] This is just for everyone, again, a broad brush stroke of statements for most entrepreneurs who

[08:31] are not very good at operating their businesses.

[08:34] Her operations is not their strong suit and her below $3 million a year.

[08:38] So anyways, most ination, there's a lot of people who have broke out, I want to be one of them

[08:41] which is why I make these videos, keeping awesome, I love you and I'll see you guys in the

[08:44] next fit.

[08:45] Bye!

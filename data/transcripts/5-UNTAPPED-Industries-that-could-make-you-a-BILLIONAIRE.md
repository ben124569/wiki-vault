[00:00] The number of questions that I get right now on this channel is, hey, I'm thinking about starting a business,

[00:04] what market should I go after? For those you don't know me, my name is Dr. Mozi, I own Acres.com.

[00:08] So when we look at portfolio companies and we're trying to figure out what markets we're going to go after,

[00:12] because we know just like Warren Buffett said, if you have a good entrepreneur and a bad market,

[00:16] the market wins. And if you've got a bad entrepreneur and a good market, the market wins.

[00:20] All right, so the market that you pick a lot of times will have a huge determination on the level of success that you have, right?

[00:25] It is far important to pick the right boat than how hard you rub. Those are Warren Buffett quotes.

[00:29] You can take those to the bank. So top five industry, I would be pursuing in 2021, 2021, 2022,

[00:35] that are coming up. All right, the first one, and believe this is going to be unsurprising to you,

[00:40] is all things that are associated with crypto. So NFTs, DeFi, WhipReplay. Now all the things that

[00:44] are coming is downstream ramifications of this new technology, right? It's booming and there's a lot of

[00:50] really cool applications that are going to come as a result of this. So if you know this industry,

[00:54] then that would be something that I would be looking at because even if you're okay,

[00:57] you will be a player in a massively growing industry. So you'll have a huge tailwind behind you.

[01:02] The second, believe or not, is cannabis, right? It's still trusted. And the reason I also like it is that

[01:08] it's relatively recession proof, right? Actually, it's a pro-recession thing. When a recession's

[01:12] happened, alcohol and drug use goes up. So this is something that's still like the market's so big.

[01:17] It still hasn't been conquered yet. There's still tons of growth to happen there. There's still

[01:20] people. It's just becoming mainstream. It still hasn't been completely, you know,

[01:24] decriminalized in all the states, et cetera. And so cannabis would be something that I would be

[01:28] looking at for types of businesses that I would be looking at building. The next one is E-Learning. So obviously,

[01:34] this is a big favorite of mine. And that's because I believe, and you probably heard,

[01:38] let me say this many times in the channel, I think that formal education has failed many of us.

[01:42] It is an antiquated system that is built on general knowledge rather than specific knowledge.

[01:47] And right now, people want specific skills that they can use in the marketplace to make more money.

[01:51] And so the E-Learning industry has become increasingly fragmented. I don't think that trend will decrease.

[01:55] I think we'll only increase in its fragmentation. It will have more silos and more verticals

[01:59] with excellent teachers at the top of them teaching very niche down skills. And so I think that if you

[02:04] have a niche skill, the E-Learning marketplace in general is something that I would be looking at

[02:11] investing in my time and effort and money, et cetera. And I walk this talk this we do with acquisition.

[02:16] We invest in these types of businesses. The fourth, and this is a huge one, is remote living.

[02:22] All right? So remote living is everything that touches the consequence of the huge push to remote.

[02:28] So more people are moving out of cities. They're moving to have more space. They're having

[02:32] at home offices. This thing that I'm recording on is a mobile studio. Right? Like, if you're

[02:37] for talking for a build mobile studio, tons of people want to be able to travel. They want to have

[02:41] studios from home. Tons and tons of business to be had there. You don't even have to market

[02:44] there so much demand for this type of stuff. And there's so many downsings of that. That's why Zoom

[02:49] blew up. There's so many things with with remote living. The reason that home, home decorations

[02:56] and home improvements has been booming, it's because people are spending more time at home. So that's

[02:59] why people want bigger houses. That's why there's been like all of this stuff is as a consequence

[03:04] of this trend, which I don't think is going to decrease. And then finally, you could consider this

[03:09] maybe a spin off of the one above, but I felt like it was different enough that it deserved

[03:14] its own thing, which is where housing logistics. There's more need for shipping and stuff to

[03:20] be stored now than ever before. And that trend will only increase as people want to stay at home.

[03:25] Right? They want stuff shipped to them. And the demand for people to be lazy is very, very high.

[03:31] Our brains are wired to do as little effort as humanly possible. And so anything that I see that

[03:36] works in a trend of delivering something to someone faster with the least amount of effort.

[03:40] And this is the value equation. Right? High perceived like we had an adream outcome, which is they

[03:44] just click something and it shows up. Those are things that I would be investing in because I believe

[03:48] that they will be the things that outperform the marketplaces all. And so if you can get into a market

[03:53] that has a tailwind, then you're also going to make the most money. And so as a reminder for those

[03:57] of you near to the channel, there are four things that we look at in every market. All right? Number one,

[04:03] is is the market growing? Number two, are the people easy to target? Number three, is there a need

[04:10] for it? Are people in pain? Right? Do they not like the way things are currently? This is my

[04:14] face. Sorry. There you go. Do they not like the way things really are and they have pain to be solved.

[04:20] And finally, do they have purchasing power? And so I would look at one of these as the big buckets

[04:26] that exist and then you find one or two steps down from this bucket, you zero in on your niche

[04:32] that you can capture that is in this growing marketplace and you will have the chips stacked in your

[04:36] favor in terms of getting investment funding in terms of the amount of demand that will that will

[04:43] happen simply based on the fact that more people want this than there are suppliers of it. And this

[04:47] is a simple supply and demand curve and we prefer to be on the things that have more demand than

[04:52] less supply, then more supply and less demand. All right? And that is how I analyze this in terms of

[04:57] the things that I'm looking at that I think are going to be good big trends that you can hop on

[05:01] if you're thinking about investing your time and effort into starting your new business. So

[05:05] anyways, Mosination lots of love keeping awesome and I'll see you guys in the next video. Bye!

[00:00] Productivity is how much money you get out for the time you put in. I know this because I went from

[00:04] $0 at age 23 to $100 plus net worth at age 31. Simply by better investing my time.

[00:11] And I'm going to teach you how I do it so that hopefully you can do it. And I'm even going to show

[00:15] you my calendar at the end of the video and walk you through step by step how I get good returns on my time.

[00:20] If you've ever had someone reach out to you and say, hey, god minute, hey,

[00:25] got 10. Hey, let me introduce you to so and so they're going to be in town. How does 10 a.m. work?

[00:30] And normally it's changed like that. You might say, yeah, I've got five minutes or sure I can meet

[00:34] so and so for coffee. The problem is that for one specific type of worker, that five minute

[00:39] meeting blows their entire morning because they can't do the development work they need. They can't

[00:43] edit the video. They can't write the book chapter because it disrupts their workflow. On the other hand,

[00:49] there's another type of worker where for them it's actually very optimal for them to take that meeting.

[00:54] The question is, which one are you and at what times? Also, special shoutouts of

[00:58] Paul Graham who wrote a tiny blog on this 14 years ago. So if time is what we invest and money is what

[01:03] we make from that investment, then the people who are the best investors of time were the ones who

[01:08] make the most money. And so it turns out there are two specific types of entrepreneurs and you'll

[01:13] switch hats throughout your day or throughout your week. The first and most common investor of time that

[01:20] people are familiar with is the manager's schedule. And these people have a very specific way of investing

[01:26] time and getting returns on it so they can make the most money. So let's talk about that.

[01:31] Managers divide their time into the smallest chunk possible. They often have 20 plus chunks per day

[01:37] from 15 minutes, sometimes five minutes, all the way to an hour or 90 minutes. And for managers,

[01:43] an empty time slot is a lost opportunity. That's time that did not get a return on investment for them.

[01:50] And for that reason, they treat time like currency. And the only real cost for them to fill is just

[01:56] the cost of coordinating with somebody else's calendar to find a mutually empty slot so that they can

[02:01] work together. Now, on paper, since work on meetings is a mutually filled slot, it makes both

[02:07] people more productive. And so when a manager interacts with another manager and they mutually fill

[02:12] a slot, both of them make more money. Now, they talk to lots of different people and do many different

[02:19] kinds of tasks all day long. This is the nature of the manager. They collect data, they report,

[02:24] data to persuade, to lead, to train, and encourage, and make other decisions one on one,

[02:30] and sometimes in groups of people. For them, they have a pretty clear beginning of the day and a

[02:34] pretty clear end of the day. The day begins when they start preparing for their meetings, maybe 30 minutes

[02:40] or an hour beforehand. And it ends at the end of their last meeting. Now, if they prep for the next day,

[02:45] then they could add that on top. But more or less, the duration of their day is directly

[02:48] proportional to the duration of the meetings they have. They basically work until their last calendar

[02:53] slot. And that's how their day works. And this is the key point here. The main objective of the

[02:57] manager is to use up all their chunks in the day so that they maximize their time. A fully book

[03:03] day is a maximally invested manager. They've used up all of their time slots and so they are productive.

[03:10] Now, the second type of time schedule management is something called the maker. And this is one

[03:17] that the vast majority of people do not know. This is where the creators, this is where the entrepreneurs,

[03:23] this is where people who have to make big things who build stuff, get the highest returns on their

[03:30] time. The vast majority of entrepreneurs at some point have some or all of their time that's

[03:35] dedicated to making stuff. This is the deep work. This is the stuff that moved the big ball forward.

[03:40] There are often tasks that are not urgent but incredibly important. And when you look back on

[03:45] your month or your quarter or your year, the few things that you remember that actually move the

[03:49] ball forward that actually move your business forward in the long term were these chunks of work.

[03:56] Now, the problem is most entrepreneurs do not have the time and do not have the system for maximizing

[04:02] that time of important work. Because fundamentally, if those are the footholds that allow you to

[04:08] push yourself forward towards your goal, then you want as many of those as possible. The difficulty

[04:13] is that it's never urgent. This is like if you're a coder and you need to develop software. Obviously,

[04:17] if that software is developed, that's the most valuable thing you can do. If you're an editor and

[04:20] you make videos, then actually adding the video so that it can get out in media is the most

[04:25] important thing that you can do. If you write copy for emails or you're an author and you write books,

[04:30] you actually writing the book and actually doing the work of the book is the most important thing that

[04:33] you can do. All of those things are makeer work. You create something that before this did not

[04:38] exist. Although this work is important, it's incredibly expensive in terms of time. And the

[04:44] problem is the vast majority of the world works on manager time not on maker time. So let me explain

[04:49] the difference. So for the maker, when you get into maker mode, instead of many small slivers like

[04:54] the manager has, you have only a few large chunks. And the reason for that is because if you put a

[05:01] meeting or you interrupt a four hour long block, then you often can't get back to the work that

[05:07] you were doing before. Also, if you know that you have a block that's coming, you can't get into the

[05:13] flow because you know that you're going to have to get out of the flow. And so this is like the

[05:16] end of day meeting that kills you. This is called the Zygrinic effect. It's that we tend to remember

[05:21] open loops and meetings are open loops because you have to set time or see, you don't forget it.

[05:25] You have to start setting a timer before the time to start wrapping up even if you're cruising

[05:29] right now. Then you start thinking about the meeting and what you have to prepare for that meeting.

[05:33] And now you're not thinking about your own work. And this eats up your brain power and

[05:37] saaps your ability to make. Unlike the manager where the decisions, the direction and the

[05:42] coordination is the output of their work. For the maker, the stuff, the things they build, the things

[05:48] they make is the output of their time. Instead of working on meetings, they work off meetings.

[05:56] They work on projects that can't get done in 30 minutes. Sometimes those projects last weeks,

[06:02] months, quarters until they're done. And so the way that that work actually looks is that

[06:07] most makers have a set start time but variable end times. So unlike the manager where they

[06:12] they know when they start and they know when they finish, most makers work open to goal.

[06:16] If you've ever lost yourself in your work and you're like, man, I just want to keep riding this

[06:20] this high. I want to keep riding this flow. That's what it feels like to make. You want to stay

[06:25] in there as long as you possibly can. And that's why having no cap on the day allows you to get

[06:30] lost in the work and produce more than you ever could. So if you have only large time chunks, that

[06:36] means that you only have one or two per day. Sometimes three if you're working 18 hours.

[06:42] And so that means you usually have a morning block and a post lunch block. Now if you're somebody

[06:46] who likes to also work after dinner, then you have a post dinner block. So you basically have

[06:50] three four to six hour chunks per day. That's it. And on a sustainable basis, most people just have

[06:56] two per day. And so if someone takes one meeting in the morning, they blew one of your 10

[07:02] work blocks per week if you only work five days a week. And so someone's taking 10 percent of your

[07:08] total output by having one meeting. The issue is that that manager who's working on manager time

[07:13] puts that thing in. And for them, they're becoming more productive. But they're destroying your

[07:18] productivity. When this happens is when you finish your day, feel like you look back and know that

[07:24] all your time was spent. But you got no return on it. You have nothing to show for it. And if you

[07:29] feel like you have that happen again and again and again, this is how businesses stay small. This is how

[07:34] entrepreneurs fail to grow. This is how they relive the same six months, same 12 months,

[07:39] same two years over and over and over again, because they do not know how to invest their time.

[07:45] For the maker, an empty time slot is not a lost opportunity. The empty time block is the opportunity

[07:53] to get the return. If you're a maker, you understand what I'm about to share with you. If you look

[07:57] at your calendar and see that you have literally nothing on there, you have no meetings, you have

[08:02] no nothing. It's just empty until the end of the day. How much energy are you filled with?

[08:06] Oh my god, I'm going to crush this day. There's all this big project. I want to sink my teeth

[08:10] into it. I'm going to be able to take a huge chunk out of it. That energy that you get is because

[08:14] that is a maximally productive day is an empty calendar rather than a filled calendar. And so for

[08:20] context, when I was writing my book, my days every day were just writing the book. And I told my

[08:26] team that that's all I was going to be doing. Now you're like, but don't you run this portfolio

[08:31] of all these companies and there's all this money and these deals and decisions that I have to

[08:33] happen. And the answer is yes. And when I show you my calendar, it'll all make sense. So literally,

[08:38] diametrically opposed calendars are both maximally allocated to invest time to get the highest

[08:46] returns on it in terms of money. The big problem is when the two need to interact because if you just

[08:51] had makers making and you just had managers managing, everyone would be happy. The problem is

[08:55] when managers manage makers and they have to meet. So when a manager doesn't know how makers work,

[09:02] they kill the productivity of their team. Managers often assume that makers can work like they do on demand.

[09:08] They think it's, hey, it's just 30 minutes and you've got free time. What's the big deal?

[09:12] I looked at your calendar. You have nothing on that. You're barely even working because they're

[09:16] using their measuring stick of work. Their way a calendar looks when they're maximally effective.

[09:21] And then transposing that on top of the makers calendar and thinking these two are the same,

[09:26] when they couldn't be more different. For a manager, a short meeting costs one work unit,

[09:31] which is maybe 15 minutes. And for them, they've got 20 plus per day. So they can easily spare one.

[09:36] Whereas if they take one from a maker, they take one of the two time slots you have per day. And

[09:41] sometimes you take both based on what the topic of the meeting is. If you say, hey, we're going to

[09:45] do your quarterly performance as an employee at two o'clock in the afternoon, the likelihood that

[09:50] the employee leading up to that is going to be able to think about the work that they're going to do.

[09:54] When they're worried about their job or they're worried about their performance all day long.

[09:57] And then afterwards, the thinking about what they said and what they could have said differently,

[10:00] that day shot to make matters worse if a maker is falling behind, the manager's solution is to

[10:05] uninterrupt them more, which creates a vicious cycle. This means managers prevent the work that they

[10:10] check in on. So by checking in on them, they disrupt the maker's work so that they can't actually

[10:15] make during the time slot to check in if they're actually working. Because the manager works while

[10:19] on meetings where the maker works when they're off meetings. And when this happens and it happens

[10:24] often, both parties lose. And this is the main point. The manager loses because the maker is not

[10:29] making what they need to be making and the managers responsible for some level of output. So both people

[10:34] aren't making the best returns on their time. This is why this is important for managers and

[10:38] important for makers. So if you are on a team, share this with your boss, share this with your team

[10:43] mates so that this can become more common in the lexicon. All my companies understand and use this

[10:48] language. If you ask as a manager for a maker to make time for you, they either one offend the

[10:56] manager by saying no, I can't do that because I'm working and the managers like, well, I see that

[11:02] you have an empty time block and I out rank you. Or even if your peers, it's like, what do you mean

[11:07] you're not going to give me that time? I see that it's empty. By refusing them, they offend

[11:11] and they can incur other risks by making that, you know, offense and declining the invitation.

[11:16] This oftentimes damages the relationship and decreases the likelihood of collaboration in the future,

[11:21] which they might need. You as a maker might need the buying of that manager. And so you risk

[11:26] losing that good will by declining the invitation, but by doing so, if you accept the invitation

[11:31] to destroy the morning. Right? And so option one, piss someone off, option two, destroy half your day.

[11:38] A very terrible proposition. And the crazy part is that even if you accept that meeting,

[11:44] oftentimes the yield from that meeting is nothing because the person who had the, do you have five

[11:49] minutes, didn't really have a gen, it didn't really have a plan. And just basically said,

[11:53] I'm just going to steal your morning from you and give you nothing back. By the way, this totally

[11:57] applies to networking stuff too. If you're like, hey, let me introduce you to Johnny's in the area.

[12:01] You guys should meet for coffee. Just 10 a.m. work. I'm like, yeah, let's just destroy everything.

[12:07] Right? Let's just light my whole day on fire so that I can meet John, who you think I have

[12:11] synergies with. Maybe there's potential for collaboration. Let's explore opportunities together.

[12:17] You know what's crazy? I know what I need to do to make more money. And I just need to do that.

[12:21] I get asked all the time about what's the one habit that you have that has been the highest,

[12:28] you know, predictor of your success. And I really genuinely believe that it has been this.

[12:37] Is that I have been ruthless with my time. Everyone who knows me knows that I am a dick with my time.

[12:44] And the thing is is that I've been able to maintain relationships because during that

[12:48] maker time where I say, you know, to everyone else, I keep moving shit forward. Because I have a

[12:54] fundamental belief that as long as I continue to achieve and I continue to make things that are

[12:58] valuable for the world, those meetings, those connections, those synergies, that friend dinner

[13:04] will always be there. And that has proven right in my life. And in the beginning, it was the hardest

[13:09] because I didn't have the accomplishments to show for it. But I truly believe. I was like, I know

[13:14] that if I can get this stuff done. And I do it every single day for a year, two years, three years,

[13:19] five years. If every day I move the ball forward, that's the thing at the end of the month when I look

[13:24] back on what I actually accomplished, 100% of it is stuff that I'm conquering maker time, not manager time.

[13:29] And so once I realized that the maker time was where everything, all the speed of me moving

[13:34] towards my goal was getting accomplished, then I spent the rest of my time trying to optimize my life

[13:39] and create a system around this that allowed me to do as much of that as I possibly could.

[13:44] And to be clear, there are roles in the business. Like, if you're CEO or CEO, or CEO,

[13:50] oh, from an operator perspective, you're going to have more one on one. You're going to have

[13:54] more team trainings. You're going to have more coordination and decision making. That's required.

[13:58] But you just have to be clear that you're not not doing your job by not having maker time. It's just that

[14:03] your job is the manager stuff. And then the maker time you have is to get more leverage on the

[14:08] remainder of your manager time. And so Laila has a different schedule than I do. She still has

[14:14] maker time, but it's probably inverted in terms of her schedule for her. She has probably one maker

[14:19] day per week and four manager days where I have four maker days per week and one manager day.

[14:25] And so you can have an inverted schedule. But the important thing is is that she has to have that

[14:31] maker day because it's what gets her leverage, get her higher returns on the other four days of the week.

[14:36] And then for me, I have to still do that manager day because it gives me leverage on all the

[14:41] or organizational decisions that have to happen throughout the whole portfolio. You have to get out of

[14:45] the either-or thinking and think which of these styles is best for me in this particular moment.

[14:51] But I can promise you that you do have elements of both when most people have elements of

[14:55] neither which is why they never move forward. So I think I've accurately described the problem here.

[15:00] makers and managers work differently. These guys want empty calendars. These guys want

[15:04] filled calendars when they interact. One person destroys the other person time and it's a dis-proportion

[15:08] it trade. And when things get bad, they get even worse because the managers interrupt the makers

[15:13] even more. And the makers trying to be polite because they don't want to turn down invitations.

[15:17] Just make their lives worse and worse. And they have to work longer and longer hours.

[15:20] Lusely, lose family time, lose their weekends so that they can just keep up with their work

[15:24] without pissing anyone off. And so let's talk about a different way to do this.

[15:29] So I use something called a three-pronged approach for the solutions. And that's because you have

[15:35] to address it from all angles. It's not just saying, hey, makers deal with it. Hey,

[15:39] managers do something different. Hey, organizations, you have to attack it from all three directions.

[15:45] You've got the managers. You've got what the makers should do differently. And then you've got the

[15:49] organization overall. So you've got all three of these parties that you have to accommodate.

[15:56] To the managers, step one, understand both the costs that you put on the maker. The first

[16:02] cost is the cost of coordinating times while they work. So they're trying to work right now.

[16:07] Before you coordinate the time that you're also going to disrupt them. So you disrupt them while

[16:12] they're working and then you disrupt them at the meeting that you're trying to plan. So you

[16:16] disrupt them twice. Secondly, and once you have that time set aside, understand that the time itself

[16:22] eats an entire work block itself. And you have to know the difference between your work and the

[16:26] makers work. And when you ask for a meeting, it costs them 10 times more. You use up one of their

[16:32] 10 times slots per week, whereas you use up only one of your hundred or more time slots. So when you

[16:38] choose to make an appointment or choose to make a meeting, be sure that it's worth it. Especially if

[16:44] it's an ad hoc or in prom too. If you have a set cadence of communication, if it can wait

[16:49] until that time and you got to be really real with yourself, can it wait? Is this just a convenience

[16:54] thing for me or a preference? If it is, then don't destroy the poor man or poor woman's time.

[16:59] Step two, understand the value of the makers know. And this is something that I hopefully

[17:04] becomes incorporating your lexicon at your business. Is that this is a makers know? Not a

[17:09] real world know. It's a makers know. Is that if a maker declines a meeting, don't take

[17:14] offence. See it as them actually trying to keep their larger commitment to you, the company,

[17:19] and other people to get the meaningful work they need to get done done. And so this means you don't

[17:24] get offended. This means you don't, you know, hold back the promotion or say that they're not being

[17:29] productive because they keep turning down meetings. If someone turns down the meeting, it's because

[17:33] they're doing something that they can accurately say this is more important than that. Now,

[17:37] if you as a manager say, I know that you have this is going to destroy the morning in terms of

[17:41] your productivity, but I think it is worth your time to be on this because we need your insight,

[17:46] then you can frame it that way and then you can give the maker the time to prep for that meeting

[17:50] if it is literally of that importance. Step three for managers is actually ask your team what an

[17:55] ideal day would look like for them. Like what's a maximum productive day look like and allow them the

[18:00] time to give you the response. And I suggest falling that to the greatest sugar possible so that you can

[18:05] actually help them be the most productive. And so for example, for us, our media team leaders asked

[18:12] the editing team underneath of them, hey, what's the perfect day for you guys? What's a perfect

[18:16] weekly calendar look like? And as a team, they're like, well, if we could just bunch all the meetings

[18:21] here and we could have all the rest of the days free, that would be awesome. And then if we had,

[18:24] there's like, okay, well, how do what about when we coordinate? It's okay. We'll have specific

[18:28] coordination times that we keep for brainstorming sessions and things like that, but beyond that,

[18:32] we keep everyone's calendars empty. And so that way, as a team, you as a manager also can have

[18:39] fewer meetings so that you can fill out with other meetings that aren't makers, right? So you can

[18:42] do more leading, more directing, more encouraging, more persuading, more training, and then let the

[18:46] makers make. And we've also realized, and I think you will break your own belief around this as

[18:51] soon as you start doing this, that a lot of work doesn't have to be done at the same time.

[18:55] Everyone doesn't need to work on the same thing at the same moment to get them most done,

[18:58] as long as everything gets done by this period of time. Now, this video isn't the

[19:03] protect the makers video. This is for all businesses and all business owners. So let's talk to the makers now.

[19:11] Step one, good managers want to help you. So let them tell them how you work. This is you communicating

[19:18] to them. Send this piece of content to them to help them help you. And yes, you will have to take

[19:25] meetings that each your entire day sometimes. It's part of the job. You have to work with other

[19:29] people because your project would never see the light of day without marketing, marketing it,

[19:33] sales, selling it, product delivering it, and everything else that happens in between. It's a team.

[19:38] And so if your manager is going to choose to put a time block in the middle of your morning or the

[19:43] middle of your afternoon, then switch that whole block into a manager schedule, fight fire with fire,

[19:49] and try to knock out as many meetings as you can in that formerly free time. So that means that

[19:54] okay, if I know that I'm going to have this one time slot that's killed my big chunk,

[19:59] well then let's slice that baby into as many chunks as I can and get all the other ad hoc and

[20:03] prompting meetings done that morning so that I now switch to a maxly productive manager. And so the

[20:09] thing is is that you don't want to identify as one of the other. You just want your calendar

[20:13] to reflect the nature of the work. And so the point here isn't to have two camps of makers and

[20:18] managers is to understand what type of productivity system you're installing for that period of time

[20:24] when you're calendar. Because especially if you're an entrepreneur, you've got to wear both.

[20:27] Step two for makers have standard meeting times where you accept meetings. So you say, hey,

[20:33] you know, Monday and Thursday afternoons is when I have all of my meeting times open. So whenever

[20:40] someone requests a meeting, ask them if they can make it in those times. And this is where when

[20:45] you get into the organization, if everyone has those times, then everyone's on makers schedules

[20:48] for those time blocks and then it becomes more efficient at an organizational level, which I'll get to in a second.

[20:52] It's rare that a meeting is truly urgent. So if you can push them off to this designated

[20:57] blocks that you said ahead of time, you will make a lot more money with the time that you have

[21:01] remaining. And you want to make this time available to anyone who meets with you on a regular basis

[21:06] and add some empty time slots or leave some empty time slots in that maker, meetings for the

[21:11] ad hoc meetings that inevitably come up. I would say I've gone through three distinct periods of

[21:15] understanding this maker manager concept and using it to great success. The first one is you basically

[21:22] have to do nights and weekends in early mornings in order to get your maker time in. But you have to

[21:26] do it. And so when I was doing this as a gym owner, so a small business owner, I would wake up

[21:31] and I would like work on ad copy and work on ads, which was like deep work that I have to do.

[21:36] And then I'd step into the gym at 9 a.m. and start taking sales calls or take training sessions

[21:43] or have to have one on ones with my trainers. I worked like a regular person with fires

[21:47] and people interrupting me all day because I was running a small business. And so if

[21:51] you need to make sure that that maker work gets done, then you need to find one block that's usually

[21:56] at the very beginning of the day or the very end of the day if you're the entrepreneur and no

[22:00] one cares about your time in the beginning. If I had not done that, I don't think I ever would have

[22:04] gotten out of one location. I would never have been able to build the systems that it takes like

[22:08] how do you build the training system to get trainers on? You do it in maker time. How do you build

[22:12] the nutrition system that you're going to use for your whole location? You do it during maker time.

[22:16] How you're going to run an advertising system for creating ads and writing copy on a regular basis?

[22:20] You do that during maker time, not during manager time. And so to build the assets that I could

[22:24] build the business on top of to build the enterprise, I had to do that on interrupted time chunks

[22:30] and the problem was everybody went and troubled my time. And to be fair, they could because I

[22:33] didn't have my time wasn't super valuable in the beginning. Over time, you'll begin to have people

[22:38] who can start protecting your time for you. So for a big chunk of my career, as I started to make

[22:43] more and more money, the first half of every day until noon or one pm was always wide open because

[22:49] I do my best work in the morning. And then once I've kind of used up my creative juice,

[22:52] I can do the coordination in meetings and things like that. Now, I'll give you a second pro tip on this,

[22:57] which is if that is the way that you want to play in your calendar, let's call yourself an

[23:01] intermediate entrepreneur, start planning your day back to front. So what I mean by that is,

[23:07] someone wants a meeting, you start at it ends at five and starts at four. If someone else wants a

[23:12] meeting, then you say it ends at four and starts at three thirty. And you work your

[23:16] calendar from back to front. That way, your front of the day is still the most open you

[23:21] possibly can have it. Now, you're still suffer from the quote, Zegernick effect, but you still have

[23:25] a very large chunk of uninterrupted time. And by doing it this way, you avoid those empty dead times

[23:31] really like great. I have 45 minutes between two meetings. Like, what am I going to do now? And you're like,

[23:35] I guess I'll just have a snack. So if you have less means than you work double time, you work on

[23:40] your client's time and then you do your work in off-hours. So like I was saying in my early days,

[23:44] by doing that morning five days a week and then I would work both shifts on the weekends.

[23:50] I would get four on the weekends. I get a morning and an afternoon on Saturday and Sunday that

[23:54] I could put make her time in and then I get five blocks during the week. And so this still

[23:57] gave me nine makers blocks per week to move big stuff forward. That's a full time job. But the key

[24:03] here, if you're noticing is that, yes, you work double because you have to work the job that

[24:08] you're currently doing to make money and then you work the next job to get out of the job you're in.

[24:12] So the V1 of this is you have to make make her time. The V2 of this is I think is the 5050 split.

[24:18] The first half of your day is Maker, the second half of your day is Manager and you work it from

[24:22] back to front. That's the V2 version. The V3 version, which is what I do currently right now, is that I've

[24:27] entire Maker days. So I have two three four days per week that are just Maker days and then I have a

[24:33] manager day where I stack that hot on my meetings, introductions, you know, coordinations, decisions,

[24:39] quarterly meetings with portfolio companies, all of that type of stuff happens on those days back

[24:43] to back. So I don't feel unproductive at the end of the day because I know going into it, I'm not

[24:48] going to do any Maker work. I'm just going to crush as many meetings as I can. Step three,

[24:52] communicate about how you're going to communicate, tell people when you're going to be slow to respond

[24:57] specifically during your Maker's box. So people have an amazing ability to adapt if you tell them

[25:03] ahead of time. People really only get upset when you have unmet expectations. They expect you to respond

[25:08] immediately and then you don't. And then they question if you're working. When the reality is that's

[25:12] why you're working is the fact that you're not responding. So change them. So let everyone know that

[25:17] this is how you work and this is when you're going to be responsive. And if you do have that time

[25:21] period where you're going to be responsive, then be responsive, which leads to step four, actually

[25:26] work when you say you will. If you have the luxury of having people who respect your time and

[25:31] respect your schedule and understand this Maker manager dynamic, then you owe it to them as a Maker

[25:36] to not waste your time. Because if you don't, you will confirm their suspicions this whole time

[25:42] that you've been goofing off all day because you're not actually working. And that's what the

[25:46] vast majority of managers think when they look at your calendar and see that it's empty, is that

[25:49] you're not actually doing anything. And what you don't want to do is prove them right. So I covered

[25:54] what you have to think about as a manager, right? You want to understand this Lingo, you want to understand

[25:58] how Maker's work and you want to try and respect that and empower them to the greatest degree possible.

[26:03] As a Maker, you also want to understand that you work within an organization. There are times

[26:06] that you're going to have to take meetings. If you do take meetings, you want to block that time

[26:10] and then crush as many meetings as you possibly can. Be responsive when you say you're going to be

[26:14] responsive. And then work like a madman during the times that you actually have empty time slots on your

[26:18] calendar. Great. So we have both of those covered. But how do we install this into an organization so

[26:22] that we can make this canon so that we can make this standard? And this is what I'm hoping

[26:26] across many organizations. So if I can use my platform to help businesses make more money and help

[26:32] people actually enjoy their work more than like can't think of a higher return on my time

[26:36] than doing that across thousands and thousands of businesses. So as an organization and this is

[26:42] if you're the entrepreneur who can make those decisions, step one, consider mandated quiet time

[26:48] on the calendar. So during these times, entire teams can't message one another or meet.

[26:54] And so either make this a time of day, every day or make this entire days of the week. So for

[27:00] example for us, Wednesdays are quiet days for the editing team like no-ontox, there are no meetings,

[27:05] they can just crank on one or two big projects they want to work on throughout that day.

[27:10] And I want to be very clear on this caveat. It doesn't need to apply to the entire organization.

[27:14] Only the ones where you have makers. So think engineers, developers, copywriters, editors,

[27:19] builders, writers, presenters, media, whatever. The people who have to work on projects that require

[27:24] intense periods of time without interruption. The reason I think this is more important now than

[27:29] ever is because of remote work. Remote work has removed the transparency between someone working.

[27:35] And so I can walk around my office now and walk past the editing base and see people plugged in,

[27:41] working on their computers editing. So I know they're editing even though their time block

[27:46] is empty if I just check their calendar. But in a remote setting, if I look at someone's calendar

[27:50] and see it's empty, but I have no way to check in on them or see them, then I don't know if they're

[27:54] actually working or if they're just like rock climbing. And so I have no way to know that.

[27:59] Then you think, okay, well, I'll just slack them. But by doing the slack message, you then disrupt

[28:03] them anyways. And if they're super responsive on Slack, you feel like they're working. When the likelihood

[28:08] is that if they're really responsive on Slack, they're not working. Because they're on Slack.

[28:12] And so the real real is that if you're remote or the teams that you have that are doing

[28:16] making a remote, you have to have an element of trust. And you still need to measure on output.

[28:22] So you can give, I would say basically extend longer periods of trust where you say, hey,

[28:26] we have this big project. This is the deadline for that project. And then you want to remove

[28:30] as many obstacles as you possibly can to allow that person to work. And let's also be real.

[28:34] There have been days where I wake up and I'm like, I don't have it in me. Like, wherever the magic

[28:37] is or the muse didn't show up to work today. Sometimes if you're a maker, then maybe see if you

[28:43] can get meetings on that day because you're like, dude, my brain's dead. Like, I don't think I'm

[28:46] going to create anything today. But there are some days where I wake up and I feel like the

[28:49] touch of God is a pod of me and I'm like, oh my God, I think I actually can cure cancer today.

[28:54] And when that happens, then sometimes it's worth changing the meetings and saying, hey, man,

[28:58] I'm in the middle of something right now and I'm crushing it. Is there any way we can just meet later?

[29:02] You know what's crazy? Most people when they get that message are like, sure, no problem. It wasn't

[29:06] urgent anyways. And sometimes they're like, you know what? We don't even need to research

[29:10] with the meeting. I actually handle it already. And so I would strongly encourage you as a

[29:14] maker to kind of keep a pulse on yourself and also managers to extend the time trust where you

[29:20] will allow makers to make. Now, if they do not meet the deadlines and they are not meeting the

[29:25] output, then you need to be very clear about this is the trust that makes standing to you. So what is

[29:29] the reason that you have for not getting this done? And real real a lot of times you actually have

[29:33] to dig into their personal lives because that's usually the most anyways. As an entrepreneur, you're

[29:37] often going to have times where you're a maker and a times where you're a manager and being clear

[29:41] to your team about which hat you're wearing. So I literally say, hey, I'm putting my maker hat on

[29:47] today. Hey, manager hat, before I step into something, and that gives me and them a mental

[29:52] cue to know how I'm operating for that day and kind of the rules of engagement. And by doing it

[29:57] that way, it sets all the expectations with one thing, one change of hat rather than we have to

[30:02] re-explain the rules every time. All right, before the last and most important point for organizations,

[30:08] let me show you my calendar and walk you through it. So this is an actual time block, I think today's

[30:14] the 31st of May as we're actually recording this. And so this is my actual calendar. And so you'll

[30:20] notice that we had a, we had Labor Day weekend, right? So Monday, I actually took off on Monday.

[30:24] So this was a short week. But Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, I have nothing on here except for

[30:30] maker times. I'm e-requording for me is maker time, like I'm making these videos. I can't do this

[30:34] and then take a meeting and then come back and make this video, right? Like I have to stay in it

[30:38] until it's done. And so this whole day, all three of these days are just straight up empty.

[30:43] And you can see I have a gym meeting with myself in the afternoon so I can get swollen.

[30:47] So I was told me that on Wednesdays, we have our quiet day for editors. But it's actually

[30:52] organization wide. And we just separated people into, are you a maker, you a manager? And so if you're a

[30:57] manager, or you deal with lots of time slots, this just doesn't apply to you. But for everyone else

[31:01] in the organization, which everyone else has transparency into, all of Wednesday is an acquisition

[31:05] outcome quiet day. And the reason that we put it on Wednesday was that way, if you think about how

[31:10] the week works out, it's like you have two quiet days on the weekend no matter what. And then you have

[31:14] two days that could potentially get interrupted with another day in between. So basically the longest

[31:18] amount of time that you have to wait as two days before you can have a guaranteed quiet day.

[31:22] Now you'll notice that Tuesday basically functioned as my Monday for this week. I had a team meeting

[31:27] with my whole company. I had a 101 with my head of investment. He's when he runs our deals.

[31:31] I had my executive meeting, which is just all the leaders in my company at Acquisites.com.

[31:37] I had a 101 with my book manager. I had meeting with our workshop manager, which is what we

[31:43] wanted to touch base. And after that meeting, I said let's not have this meeting anymore. Immediately after

[31:47] the meeting. So to be clear, like, I try to always audit like, do I need to do this again? Or is there a

[31:53] processor a person who can do this instead of me? And most times there is a processor person.

[31:57] After that, I had my school games Q&A. So I had once a week I take a call with the school games,

[32:01] and notice I do these calls that I have with customers on my meeting day because it's still an

[32:07] interruption and it to me. It feels the same. It's like, I hop on. I'm asking questions. I'm

[32:10] answering questions. I'm directing. I'm doing whatever. Then I had my marketing meeting for our

[32:14] internal marketing stuff. And that was it. I had a hair trim and then I had my gym. All right.

[32:18] And so you'll be like, wait, that's it. I just saw Alex his whole week. That's all the meetings he takes.

[32:23] In the answer is yes. Now, I think what might be more important than the things that you saw,

[32:28] the things that you didn't see. And so there's meetings that happen all the time with the

[32:34] leadership, with my team and portfolio companies, with my media buy on their media buyer, my

[32:40] portfolio operating partner and the CEOs of the companies that we own. All of those meetings,

[32:46] you'll note none of them were all my calendar. At some point, I see the entrepreneurial journey

[32:51] as a relinquishing of control. And at every level of entrepreneurship, you need to learn a new

[32:55] level of giving up control. And so what's interesting is that when we get into entrepreneurship,

[32:59] we do it because we want freedom. But as soon as we do it to get freedom, we actually have

[33:03] absolute control over everything because you have control of your solar perner now. Like you have

[33:07] no team, it's just you. But when you have control over everything, you actually don't have freedom.

[33:11] So you cannot have both absolute control and absolute freedom at the same time. And so if you want

[33:15] freedom, you have to relinquish control. You have to extend trust to people. Now, those trust can

[33:20] have guard rails and you can still have outputs that you measure people on and then you basically

[33:23] tighten up the reins if things don't go to plan. But as long as people are doing their job

[33:28] and meeting the outputs, then you can continue to extend the leash. I don't really like the terminology,

[33:32] but you get the idea. And so at the end of every one of these meetings, I'm telling you,

[33:37] like if you could just put a little reminder to yourself, does do I need to do this again?

[33:40] Like does this meeting even need to occur again? And secondarily, is there somebody else or a

[33:45] system we can put in place to eliminate this altogether? Layla and I, she's even better about this

[33:50] because she has more meetings as an operator than I do. Every single week, she starts her week

[33:56] by looking at all of her meetings and deletes. She deletes first. And then on a quarterly basis,

[34:01] she looks at all recurring meetings and says, how do I, how can I change the time that's being

[34:06] allocated across all companies? So she sees everyone's calendars and everyone's meeting,

[34:09] she does some reinman stuff where she says, I don't think we need to do this anymore. I think we can

[34:13] combine these two. I think you don't need to attend these. And she tells people, I don't think

[34:17] you need to attend this anymore. I don't think you need to attend this. And I think that's where

[34:19] culture of meetings don't make you productive is a very important subline here for organizations in

[34:26] general. And you'll notice this with Elon Musk and basis and some of these great entrepreneurs

[34:30] they talk about this where they want to standardize like, hey, you can get up in the middle meeting

[34:34] and say, hey, I've just got stuff I need to do and I don't think I'm relevant here. I don't think

[34:37] I'm adding value. That's you returning time to the company because this is the thing that everyone

[34:42] forgets is that let's say you make $50,000 a year. That means that you make around $25 per hour

[34:52] in general. And so if you have and let's say you've got some people making $100,000 a year on the meeting.

[34:56] So that's $50 per hour. That means that if you have 10 people on that on a one hour call,

[35:03] it's like that was a $500 call or a $400 call. Now if we took the whole team out to chillies

[35:11] and we spent $400 on drinks and chips and whatever it would be considered a major expense, right?

[35:17] But every day all the time you're taking the whole team out to chillies 10 times a day. This is why

[35:23] people stay poor because they don't know how to allocate time to get the highest returns.

[35:28] So let's walk through the last step for organizations to make this real to get the most out of

[35:35] everyone. Spread this content to makers and managers alike so that everyone can use the same language

[35:42] to describe this larger source of waste and prevent it because if you are working with a maker

[35:49] manager's schedule or everyone understands where people can get the highest returns in their time.

[35:53] And your competition is not working this way. You will get higher returns on human capital on the

[35:59] time you invest in people because they will be happier. They will stay longer. They will have higher

[36:03] output and the quality of their work will go up. So you will both get higher quantity of work

[36:08] and higher quality of work both by changing how you allocate time and trying actively

[36:13] remove as many makers as possible from meetings and also managers don't need to be there.

[36:18] And my goal with this video is to increase the awareness of these two types of working styles

[36:23] and put words to something that plagued me for a very long time. And so if you're listening to this

[36:28] new like this is music to my ears this is what I've been trying to describe for such a long time

[36:32] and I have been able to put words to it. I made this for you so that I could put words to something

[36:37] that hopefully everyone else can use and distribute at a bargain on time. It's that you don't have

[36:42] to worry about making this thing you can just send it so that people can understand it for you.

[36:46] And hopefully this gives words to the makers who's work moves the world and helps managers

[36:52] understand how expensive God a minute really is.

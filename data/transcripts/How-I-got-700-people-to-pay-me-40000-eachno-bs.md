[00:00] You've just been an hour arm wrestling client to sell a $1,000 package,

[00:04] whereas here people buy $40,000 packages over the phone and less than 15 minutes.

[00:11] So when I was 28 years old, I was five or six years into business or my business career.

[00:16] And I had just gone through a five-day gauntlet, so I had done a two-day client event,

[00:22] which was we had six or seven hundred clients that had come to our high-slope program in person.

[00:28] And then the next day I had my executive meeting in two days after that,

[00:33] I did a meeting with all 135 arm employees who flew out to Austin to do a two-day conference with us,

[00:40] do some trainings, all that kind of stuff.

[00:41] My dad calls me up after this kind of five-day marathon.

[00:45] And he says, hey, Alexander, because that's what he calls me, right?

[00:48] He says, hey, Alexander, but he sounded really way more concerned.

[00:51] And I was like, what's going on?

[00:53] And so I wrote a lot of bed, put a hoodie on, walking in the hallway,

[00:56] so I didn't wake lay up.

[00:58] And he says, I thought you said this was just going to be a meeting of your highest-level clients.

[01:04] And I was like, if it was, it was like, didn't those people pay like $42,000 a year,

[01:09] the highest-level people?

[01:10] And I was like, yeah, but I thought, but you just said you had like seven hundred people there.

[01:14] And I was like, yeah, I know.

[01:16] And I was like, what's the issue?

[01:17] And he was like, you had seven hundred people who paid that much money.

[01:21] And I was like, yeah, what kind of came next was something that I think,

[01:26] probably stung a little bit at the time, but I knew that it wasn't coming from a place of,

[01:30] or I didn't think it was coming from a place of meanness.

[01:34] And he says, do they know that they're paying you that much?

[01:37] I was like, yeah, they're aware.

[01:40] So not like a magically-siphoning money out of their bank accounts.

[01:43] He's like, well, I mean, I hope, I hope what you're giving them is worth it.

[01:47] That could have really stung, and it probably did.

[01:50] But I think I was kind of in such an emotionally exhausted state,

[01:53] because if you've done five days of just pure events,

[01:56] I was like, I had no adrenals to get angry with.

[02:00] And so I said, well, let me walk you through it.

[02:03] So I said, if I made you $239,000, would you pay me $42,000?

[02:09] He was like, well, how long would it take me?

[02:12] And I was like, it would take 11 months.

[02:16] He was like, okay, well, do I know I'm going to make that money?

[02:19] And I was like, yeah, you're pretty sure you're going to make the money.

[02:21] And it was like, okay, it's like, well, what would I have to do?

[02:25] That's like, you wouldn't have to do a ton.

[02:28] You'd have to probably do about 15 hours a week or where.

[02:31] He was like, okay, and what I have to pay that all upfront,

[02:35] or how would I have to pay you?

[02:38] And I was like, you would pay me as you made the money.

[02:41] And it was like, huh, well, then yeah, I would do it.

[02:45] And I was like, and that's why they do too.

[02:47] And so when I walked my father through that kind of mental explanation,

[02:51] and part of that was to make sure that my father, you know,

[02:54] felt like I was legit.

[02:55] But the other part of it, his questions actually denote

[02:59] what the components of value are.

[03:01] And so the purpose of this video is to walk you through the value equation,

[03:04] which I think, you know, might be one of the bigger contributions

[03:07] that I'll have into the marketing world.

[03:10] And there are four components to value.

[03:12] That's why I have my little handy-dandy iPad here so we can do this all visually.

[03:15] All right, so we'll say value.

[03:17] And we have the four components, of course, of value,

[03:20] to do.

[03:21] When I was creating this, it was because I wanted to figure out what this word meant.

[03:25] I think values, one of the hardest things that we have as entrepreneurs to understand,

[03:29] we just say it's used loosely lifetime value,

[03:32] value, you know, provide more value, access to value,

[03:34] blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right?

[03:35] But we don't know what it actually means.

[03:37] And if you ask them, well, what is value?

[03:39] Right? How do you describe value?

[03:41] How do you measure or quantify value?

[03:43] I think this is my one of my better things.

[03:46] And so this is the value equation is Alex from us.

[03:49] He defines it.

[03:50] Okay, so there are four components to this.

[03:52] The first component is what I consider the dream outcome.

[03:56] All right, and when I was thinking about this,

[03:58] it all started because I was really trying to figure out why

[04:03] some people would buy some things and not other things.

[04:06] And at the very beginning of this, it was,

[04:09] if I were selling to men in general, more men value,

[04:12] making money, then losing weight, right?

[04:15] And so in general, the category of things that make people

[04:18] money cost more, for men, than the category of things

[04:23] of losing weight.

[04:23] And that's because the dream outcome of making money,

[04:26] at least for men, increases status more than losing weight does.

[04:29] And so as a result, that is deemed more valuable.

[04:32] And so while I go through each of these components,

[04:34] I'm going to give you two kind of examples of one that

[04:36] exemplifies it and doesn't exemplify it

[04:38] so that you can see it kind of in the real world.

[04:40] The first component is, is the thing that we are selling

[04:43] valuable in terms of, is the dream outcome that we're going to deliver

[04:47] to the prospect, something that they would like.

[04:49] The reason this is probably the first one is because it kind of defines

[04:52] the category.

[04:53] Now, within a category, the remaining three variables are the things

[04:57] that will determine what is expensive and what is not.

[05:00] And to go back to the weight loss scenario, if I have a woman, for example,

[05:05] who wants to lose weight, and I sell, there's probably

[05:07] some things that help people lose weight that are five dollars

[05:09] and some things that help people lose weight that are $50 dollars.

[05:11] So you've got a $5 ebook and you've got

[05:13] life-hosts section.

[05:14] All right.

[05:15] So why is one $5 and $150 dollars when the dream outcome is the same

[05:20] of losing weight?

[05:20] That's where the other three variables of value come into play.

[05:23] Value number two, and obviously the goal here is to increase the dream outcome.

[05:26] The more, the more appealing we can make it seem,

[05:29] the more viscerally we can describe what the dream outcome is going to be like

[05:32] when the, when the prospect experiences it,

[05:34] then they're going to deem it more valuable.

[05:36] And then by extension, be willing to pay us more for it.

[05:38] The second component of value is perceived

[05:42] likelihood of achievement.

[05:43] And believe it or not, this was actually the last of the four

[05:47] because I was still trying to figure out, because I felt like something was missing.

[05:50] And so this is the easiest example that I can give you mentally for two things

[05:54] where one is more valuable than the other based on the perceived likelihood of achievement.

[05:58] And so for example, if you were going to get,

[06:00] now we'll use life-hosts section as an example.

[06:02] If you're going to get surgery, right, from a, from a, from a doctor.

[06:04] And one doctor, this is their first surgery coming out of medical school.

[06:08] And the other doctor is their 10,000th surgery of this specific type of surgery.

[06:12] Which guy would you be willing to pay more for?

[06:15] Well, obviously the 10,000th surgery guy, right?

[06:18] I mean, if anything, you probably have the first time surgery guy.

[06:20] You'd want to do it for free or have him pay you, right?

[06:23] And so, and what's funny about this just as an added tangent,

[06:26] is that the guy who, it's their first time would probably end up taking longer.

[06:31] So you're actually getting less time with the guy who's done it 10,000 times

[06:34] and the guy who's done it once or never, right?

[06:36] And so even though you're actually getting less time,

[06:39] you're willing to pay more for it,

[06:40] which is just another interesting thing, which is why values,

[06:43] time in terms of how long it takes you to fulfill something,

[06:46] should never be in the value of patient for yourself, all right?

[06:50] So first, is dream outcome?

[06:51] Is the thing that we're, that we're going to sell this,

[06:53] the experience that they're going to have,

[06:55] would they imagine themselves experiencing going to be out of them?

[06:58] Second, is how likely do they perceive the achievement of that dream outcome?

[07:02] If I buy something, right, like that ebook example.

[07:05] If I'm buying an ebook for a simple life,

[07:06] the intersection, the likelihood that I think that I'm actually going to get the

[07:09] stomach that I want is probably significantly lower with an ebook than with life

[07:13] or such, right?

[07:14] So the perceived likelihood of achievement is lower and by extension,

[07:17] I will now get less value.

[07:19] I will perceive less value and be willing to pay less for it.

[07:22] And so for us, as business owners and promoters for our businesses,

[07:26] the goal is that in this equation and the reasons of fraction

[07:29] is that we want to increase both of these things, right?

[07:32] We want to increase the perceived likelihood of achievement,

[07:34] and we want to increase the dream outcome.

[07:36] This is why a lot of marketers start promising bigger and bigger things.

[07:39] I also believe that it's the most amateur, it's the most beginner,

[07:42] but it's where everyone starts.

[07:44] All right, this is where I started my career where all I would do is dream is to

[07:47] bigger and bigger dream outcomes.

[07:48] I promise more and more, and the perceived likelihood of achievement,

[07:51] what I did is I put more and more and more more to testimonials.

[07:53] So the more testimonials I had, the higher the certainty that the person or the

[07:56] prospect would experience what I was selling.

[07:58] They believed me that if I'd have found a thousand testimonials versus one,

[08:02] you believe the person is better at the thing, right?

[08:04] And if they're better at the thing, you're more certain, which actually decreases risk,

[08:08] which becomes more valuable.

[08:09] Third, so this is the bottom side of the equation.

[08:12] Right? So the top side of the equation we're trying to increase,

[08:14] the bottom side of the equation we're trying to decrease.

[08:16] All right? So this is time to lie.

[08:18] So the time to lie is the time between when I pay and what I get, what I want.

[08:24] I have this kind of in two separate pieces here.

[08:26] Well, I'll just talk about the main one and then I'll talk about the fourth one.

[08:29] It'll still hit it.

[08:30] All right?

[08:30] So time to lie, and this is probably one of if not the most powerful thing,

[08:34] so if you want to enter into a marketplace,

[08:36] you can do whatever the best guys doing and do it in half the time,

[08:39] and you will become more valuable.

[08:40] Right? People will pay for speed, right?

[08:44] And if you ever competing in somebody who's free or giving away free stuff,

[08:47] sometimes you compete against government services.

[08:49] I've got a friend of mine who does DMV expedited services in New Mexico,

[08:53] all right? And they have 14 locations of basically expedited DMV services.

[08:58] You can renew your license and all that kind of stuff.

[09:00] And they cost 50 bucks instead of being free from the government.

[09:02] And they murder it, murder it.

[09:05] Even though they're competing in something that's free,

[09:07] they beat them on speed.

[09:09] And so if you ever competing against free, compete with speed, right?

[09:14] Fast beats free.

[09:14] Okay? So time to lie.

[09:16] Can I do the thing faster?

[09:18] Can I get them there faster?

[09:19] Now, the longer it takes, the less valuable my service or product is.

[09:24] Right? The shorter it takes, the more valuable it is.

[09:27] So in theory, if I were to click buy on a digital product for a sick pack,

[09:31] and then look at my abs, and I have a sick pack,

[09:34] that would be an infinitely valuable product, right?

[09:36] And so if we can think about our services,

[09:38] is like how quickly, right, can I make this happen in reality?

[09:41] A different example would be, if I were selling marketing services,

[09:44] right, to a physician.

[09:46] And as soon as they're card ran, they're phone rang, right?

[09:49] On the front desk, with somebody saying, hey,

[09:51] I just heard about your thing, I'm qualified, I'd like to buy your services.

[09:54] That would be unbelievably valuable, right?

[09:57] Immensiably valuable because of the speed, right?

[10:00] And so you can in a very real way increase the value of what you sell

[10:03] without changing the thing, but only delivering the outcome faster.

[10:06] That's the third component of value.

[10:08] So the idea here is that we want to decrease the time to light, right?

[10:11] We want to make it faster for the prospect to experience the outcome that we are promising.

[10:17] Fourth component of value, all right?

[10:19] And there's two components of this.

[10:20] So I'm going to give you some nuances here.

[10:21] It's effort and sacrifice.

[10:24] So effort is what someone must do, that they don't want to do

[10:29] in order to achieve the outcome.

[10:30] Sacrifice is what they have to give up or stop doing that they do enjoy doing

[10:36] in order to achieve the outcome.

[10:37] So I'll give you an example of both.

[10:39] All right, so it's kind of like four, four A and four B, right?

[10:42] But I think they're kind of, I both them in the same thing because I think

[10:45] they are similar enough that they're worth putting in the same bucket.

[10:48] So effort, for example, would be like if I wanted to lose weight, right?

[10:52] Then if I'm, you know, Cindy Luhu, all of a sudden,

[10:55] I'm not doing certain things.

[10:57] I might not be weighing my food.

[10:58] I might not be counting my calories.

[10:59] I might not be eating, you know, shopping at the healthy grocery store.

[11:02] I might not be working out in the morning.

[11:05] I might not be waking up right early in order to get the gym.

[11:10] I might not have an extra hour or two every day that I have to dedicate to this.

[11:13] I might not be sore, right?

[11:15] These are all things that I now have to experience that I don't want to experience

[11:19] that are part of effort, right?

[11:20] These are things that make this less valuable.

[11:22] On the flip side, if I were to sacrifice,

[11:26] I'm sacrificing the foods I love.

[11:27] I'm sacrificing sleeping in.

[11:29] I'm sacrificing walking down this dares without being in pain.

[11:32] And so I think effort and sacrifice oftentimes are flip,

[11:35] kind of both sides of the coin, right?

[11:37] They're either, they're heads of tails of the same concept,

[11:40] which is why.

[11:40] But I think if you can think of that in terms of your own services,

[11:43] is like, what am I making someone give up?

[11:45] And what am I making someone start doing?

[11:47] They weren't doing before that they don't want to do, right?

[11:50] And so again, the goal here is, how can I decrease the effort and

[11:53] sacrifice associated with achieving the outcome when they buy for me?

[11:56] The example would be, if I had the abs thing, right?

[12:00] Now, let's say it was instant, but it was incredibly painful, right?

[12:03] When you clicked the button, then you get the abs, but it was just like,

[12:06] it felt like fire all over your body.

[12:08] That would be a lot of effort and sacrifice.

[12:10] I mean, that's painful, right?

[12:11] That's literally painful.

[12:12] Versus, nothing at all.

[12:13] Well, in each of those examples, the one that isn't painful is going to be more valuable,

[12:17] right?

[12:18] And so, as I think through product lines,

[12:21] service lines, I always attack it from this perspective.

[12:24] All right?

[12:25] Is how can I create more value by increasing the dream outcome?

[12:27] And my expression of it so that they believe what I am saying,

[12:31] and the way I have depicted what they want to be actually what they want.

[12:35] And you would be surprised how many times people get this wrong, right?

[12:39] I was talking to Dr. John Barardi,

[12:42] is the co-founder of Precision Nutrition.

[12:44] They sold for a nine figure plus exit.

[12:47] He was talking about one of the biggest breakthroughs they had in their business

[12:49] when they understood the job to be done.

[12:52] All right?

[12:52] So they sold certifications, right?

[12:54] He said, most people think that selling certifications about selling continued education.

[12:59] He was like, that's not the dream outcome.

[13:01] People are not actually wanting to buy the certification.

[13:04] The dream outcome of the certification and the experience around that

[13:08] is actually being in a community and being meshed with other people who were just like you.

[13:13] Weird, just like you.

[13:14] And so, as soon as they realized that that was actually the job to be done,

[13:18] and people just wanted to socially acceptable,

[13:19] excuse to go do that, right?

[13:21] Certification is socially acceptable, excuse to do that.

[13:23] Then in that instance, now they had to find the dream outcome properly

[13:26] as to what people actually wanted, right?

[13:29] And so, as huge breakthrough in their business and their business

[13:31] to love and all that kind of stuff.

[13:32] And so, getting the dream outcome right may seem simple,

[13:34] but a lot of times being able to depict it accurately

[13:36] back to the prospect as they desire it is extremely valuable.

[13:40] So, the goal is to increase the top side and decrease the bottom side.

[13:44] And one of the things that, and the reason this is a fraction

[13:46] and not an addition and then subtraction equation is that,

[13:49] if you can get these bottom things down to zero, right,

[13:51] getting the bottom to zero, you have an infinitely valuable product.

[13:54] So, no matter what your promise is on the top,

[13:56] even it's tiny, the tiny and convenient to help people avoid.

[13:59] If it's immediate and it requires no effort on their part,

[14:02] you have an infinitely valuable product.

[14:03] And when I look at the biggest businesses, when I look at my own businesses

[14:06] and how I've changed this knowledge for no over time,

[14:08] I used to focus only on the top side.

[14:11] And now, when I look at the Amazon's, I look at the Netflix, I look at

[14:13] Uber, all of that stuff is stuff that decreased the downside.

[14:17] Uber made it immediate.

[14:19] And now, if you've seen on Lyft, you can get first in line.

[14:23] So, it's like boom, you can hit it for an extra $5,

[14:25] you can get picked up in extra, like, in a minute.

[14:27] Right, it's crazy.

[14:28] But they were smart about it.

[14:29] They realized they could increase the value by decreasing the time to Netflix.

[14:32] Made decreased all the effort and sacrifice that went along with Washington Television

[14:36] and seeing and running movies, all that stuff, it was immediate for them.

[14:40] Right, there's no effort, no sacrifice.

[14:42] It's all right there.

[14:42] You don't have any picking and just boom.

[14:44] They're like, make suggestions, et cetera.

[14:46] This theme, Amazon, right?

[14:47] You buy it and then they've got drones delivering it to you in two hours.

[14:50] They consistently, the biggest companies decrease the downside of the equation,

[14:53] which is where more of the work happens.

[14:55] But in my opinion, it's also where the biggest,

[14:58] motorized from a competitive advantage standpoint.

[15:00] And so this, as I look at my companies, this is what I'm focusing on with our

[15:04] products, our services.

[15:05] How can we decrease the time to Ly?

[15:07] How can we decrease the effort and sacrifice that are associated with achieving the

[15:10] outcome that we want?

[15:11] And then, instead of doing, increase the perceived likelihood of achieving the prospect.

[15:15] So what I want to do is give you one side by side example of this concept.

[15:19] So you've got personal training and you've got Lypa.

[15:22] All right?

[15:23] So you've got both kind of versions of the same dream outcome.

[15:27] All right?

[15:27] So both dream outcomes are you going to look good, you're going to feel good, all that kind of stuff.

[15:30] Right?

[15:31] So I would say this is a one out of one.

[15:34] If we were to rate this on a binary scale,

[15:36] of does it achieve the dream outcome?

[15:37] Yes, personal training will help you look good, feel good, et cetera.

[15:40] Life, perception, up your look, good feel, et cetera.

[15:42] All right?

[15:42] Now look at, let's look at the second thing here, right?

[15:45] Proceed likely to have achievement.

[15:46] If you're buying personal training, the perceived likely to have achievement,

[15:49] probably kind of low, right?

[15:51] Because you're like, am I really going to do this?

[15:53] Am I really going to fall the new, new trisplant?

[15:54] Am I really going to wake up?

[15:56] Am I going to do all this stuff?

[15:57] Do I really think it's going to happen for me?

[15:59] Probably put it zero.

[16:00] Most people don't actually think they're going to be successful when they buy the thing.

[16:03] Now, on the contrary, life perception, do you think that you're going to have less

[16:05] fat on your stomach when you buy life, perception?

[16:07] The answer is yes.

[16:08] You do think that you're going to have less.

[16:10] So the perceived likely it, that you're going to do it, very high, which is one.

[16:13] Let's go to number three.

[16:14] So time to light.

[16:15] All right?

[16:15] So personal training, am I going to have it immediately?

[16:18] No, personal training might take 12 months or 18 months or 24 months,

[16:21] before I get to my ideal weight.

[16:22] And even then, I still might not be my body might not the way I want it.

[16:25] The look or my stomach might have extra skin.

[16:27] All that kind of stuff, right?

[16:28] So it's going to take a long time for me to get to where I want to get to.

[16:32] Right?

[16:32] It's not going to happen soon.

[16:33] Boom, we've got another zero here.

[16:36] Now, life perception, if they just suck all the stuff out of my stomach and they cut the

[16:40] skin off, right?

[16:41] And it's nice and tight, right?

[16:42] What's the like?

[16:43] What's the time to lay on that?

[16:44] I know, maybe a month, maybe two months, right?

[16:47] Before it, it's already in sucked in, right?

[16:50] So it's a short, unmot shorter time to lay for the dream outcome to occur.

[16:54] And then finally, effort and sacrifice for personal training, all the things I gave earlier.

[16:59] Right?

[17:00] I got to go, I got to change the way I shop.

[17:02] I got to change the way I eat.

[17:03] I got to wake up early.

[17:03] I got to be sore three days a week.

[17:05] Right?

[17:06] I might not be able to eat with my kids.

[17:07] Like, there's all these other pains that go with that.

[17:08] I got to learn how to cook healthy, all these things, right?

[17:11] Like, oh, I don't change anything.

[17:13] Right?

[17:14] The effort and sacrifices, I fall asleep and instantly I'm woken back up from my medical

[17:17] coma.

[17:18] I am sore in my stomach, for sure, you know, for three or four weeks, but then after that,

[17:22] it's done.

[17:23] Right?

[17:24] We're a shear on this personal training side, right?

[17:26] I'm going to be sore for years, right?

[17:29] Now, my goal here is not to debate whether, you know, I think people should do fitness

[17:33] or do life perception.

[17:34] I'm obviously just doing whatever you want, right?

[17:37] But for the context of us as business owners to understand the difference in value, this

[17:42] is a one out of four, and this is a four out of four, which is why you have to spend an hour

[17:48] arm wrestling a client to sell a $1,000 package, whereas here people buy $40,000 packages

[17:53] over the phone and less than 15 minutes.

[17:56] And that is the difference of value.

[17:58] And that is why the value equation is how I think that this is how I see business, the

[18:03] statistic, me along time to figure out, and so I wanted to share it with you guys.

[18:06] So anyways, lots of love, keeping amazing.

[18:08] And if this was interesting for you FYI, my book just released, it's 99 cents, you can get

[18:13] it, I made it 99 cents, and the goal of all the things that I have here is, you know,

[18:17] we're trying to build a portfolio of companies that does a billion dollars a year in revenue,

[18:21] we're currently at about 85 million.

[18:23] I know there are a lot of people in the world, and my point here is to make sure that

[18:27] you are not one of them.

[18:28] And to a good bunch of winners with the stuff that they need to succeed without having to buy

[18:32] any courses only internet.

[18:34] So keeping awesome awesome love and see you in the next vid.

[18:36] Bye!

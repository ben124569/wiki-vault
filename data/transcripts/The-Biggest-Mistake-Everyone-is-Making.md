[00:00] Literally everyone listen to this. This is the number one mistake that I see entrepreneurs make that I made

[00:05] Growing up, so please do not do this because it is incredibly painful and it takes so long to get out of so please do not do this

[00:13] So it's talking such winner and I said

[00:15] You have three businesses and you've got three different product lines in each of those businesses and I'll bet you right now

[00:20] The 80% of your revenue comes from just 20% of that stuff

[00:24] Predispensable nothing nothing crazy here and he looked at all of his numbers used like yeah

[00:28] I guess this is really the main thing and I was like why did you do all these other things?

[00:31] He said well seem like a good idea at the time and they just felt like there was just extra money sitting there on the table that we should just grab here

[00:36] It's crazy the extra money that's sitting there on the table is the money that distracts you from the main game

[00:43] I like to use this principle called the women in the red dress

[00:45] So if you've seen the matrix right, which is my favorite movie all time a more fierce is explaining neo that

[00:52] Anybody in the matrix could be an agent right, so there's women in the red dress who walks by and then all of a sudden he turns background

[00:57] It's an agent right and I like to use that analogy because the woman in the red dress is the distractions that we use the easy money that's sitting there on the sideline

[01:05] So I had a conversation with an entrepreneur

[01:08] in the digital marketing space doing about five four five millennia and

[01:13] He said I think I want to do general business coaching because I've got all these people were asking me for general business coaching

[01:18] And I was like why on earth would you do that?

[01:20] He's like well, I mean they're just they're asking them just turning money down and I was like

[01:25] That's the point that is the point of a strategy a strategy is learning one to say no

[01:30] And so I said hold on for a second before you do this right you have your business right now

[01:35] And because it's hard for you to grow it

[01:38] You're gonna choose to distract yourself from something that's gonna give you an easy win which gives you that nice dope

[01:43] Literally everyone listen to this. This is the number one mistake that I see entrepreneurs make that I made

[01:49] Growing up so please do not do this because it is incredibly painful and it takes so long to get out of so please do not do this

[01:56] All right

[01:57] What they do is that the thing they have becomes hard because they reach a limitation either on their beliefs

[02:03] Their skills or their character traits and so as a result of that limitation on the ladder that they've built for themselves with beliefs on one side

[02:09] Character chunks any other and skills is the middle runs that they after guys

[02:12] You have to have all three in order to grab the next wrong right?

[02:15] They have those those those aspects in the hit a level and what they do is they see another ladder next to them

[02:20] They have some runs already built because they have those things and they just jump on to that ladder

[02:24] But then they climb and then they reach another pinnacle that's still not above their first ladders

[02:29] Limit right of skills character traits and beliefs and so what happens is they make this jump?

[02:34] And so I was going back to this entrepreneur and I was like hey man

[02:37] So could you imagine a world how easy would it be for you if you just eliminated everything in your business and all you to do is grow this one thing

[02:47] I say how easy would that be and he was like do that be easiest

[02:50] I was like you know 80% of my time is dealing with all these other things in the operational drag and complex here on that you know these other teams

[02:56] And blah blah blah blah I was like right

[02:58] So I don't need to do that

[03:01] And so when I come into most businesses most of times I get the entrepreneur to do less

[03:06] I get the business to do fewer things because simple you can write this down right this down

[03:11] Simple scales fancy fails

[03:13] You can use that you can take it at the bank on core mozi all right

[03:16] Mozi nation that's one of our one of our one of our 10 it all right simple scales

[03:21] Fancy fails and if you got a fancy business

[03:24] I'll tell you the richest guys in the world have simple ass

[03:28] Businesses and they have the character traits to see that woman in the red dress walk by and say not today Nancy not today

[03:34] I'm good you're not gonna you're not gonna seduce me today into into some quick money

[03:39] That's gonna take me away from the long-term goal that's what strategy is it's learning to say no

[03:44] It's learning to say no because you know that your marriage in the long-term is gonna get you higher returns

[03:50] Then the short term quick fix right and that's a character trait that you have to develop and here's what's crazy

[03:56] The higher up in business you go the higher up that ladder that you climb

[04:00] The sexier the woman in the red dress looks like the sexier the seduction appears the sexier the temptation appears because right now

[04:08] somewhere to come to me and say

[04:10] Let's say

[04:11] Or let's just say that you're making a million dollars here all right in your business. Let's see your netting 200 billion pounds

[04:16] What up all right just as a hypothetical example if someone came to you right now and said dude

[04:21] I can help you make a next thousand dollars a month you'd be like I'm good no thanks

[04:24] Right, but if someone came to you and said hey man

[04:26] I can help you make an extra 50 thousand more some month you might be tempted by that right?

[04:31] Or maybe an extra an extra 100 thousand one they might be tempted by that right?

[04:36] But the reality is that it's just a woman in the red dress

[04:40] It's agent Smith is hiding pretending to be this this thing that's gonna give you the short term win

[04:46] When in reality all it's gonna do is distract you from the long-term success that you're trying to have because if you just

[04:52] Match the market and you just do the one thing over and over again if you just repeat successful actions

[04:56] If you have aggressive patients if you do the boring work and you let it compound and you let compounding happen for you and with you

[05:02] Instead of against you and you use time as an asset instead of a liability instead of being in a rush all the time

[05:07] You actually use patience as a as a lever on your success

[05:11] Use time as an asset that works for you instead of against you and if you if you can do those things

[05:17] You'll be unreasonably successful, but it's because you took decisions you made decisions you had character traits that were unreasonable and

[05:25] Uncommit

[05:26] Right uncommon success is not because it's complex. It's because it's hard and it's hard not because it's complicated

[05:32] It's hard because it's so simple no one does it

[05:35] We let our humanity in our irrationality and our need for immediate short term wins get in the way of what our long-term strategies

[05:42] And I'll say this again strategies know what you say no to

[05:45] Not we say yes to if you think about who you serve who your avatar is what you help them do

[05:51] You get a lot more strength than knowing what you don't do you have to turn money down

[05:55] You know as money I turned on every day like I literally get a DM I probably get 2 DM today

[05:59] Say hey man, I'll pay you 10 grand for an hour of time. I'm just like dude. I just don't

[06:04] It's just not I can't like I can't say yes that it's just distracting to me to to do what I'm trying to do and the thing is is that

[06:10] That woman in the red dress the higher up you become the more sexy she becomes and one of the biggest I mean in the mistakes

[06:16] I've made many of these mistakes. I think I started my second business too early

[06:19] I start with Jesus loves our subman company too early and I think I suffered for that

[06:22] It took I think it'd basically flatline our growth for two years because of that and it took me to

[06:27] To develop all these other character traits that I had to do instead to learn how to actually I went from running one business to running two businesses

[06:33] And I'll just give you this quick tidbit if you're listening to this you might be thinking well Alex

[06:38] How do you have these women in the red dress because you know have you know six seven whatever

[06:41] We have a lot in our portfolio now. How do you reconcile it? Well now for me the portfolio is the one thing my portfolio is the one thing

[06:50] And that is the that's kind of the overarching thing for me now is that I

[06:57] Did this out of sequence and so don't make please don't make them say you can do it if you want but like for me

[07:01] This is mistake. I made is that if you were running a business and here's how you define running a business if the business

[07:07] Does not grow without you spending less than five hours a week on it for six straight months and you never have to jump back in

[07:15] That is when you are you have transitioned from CEO to owner

[07:18] All right, and right now if why if it means if you have if you don't have to do anything you're not part of the fulfillment right

[07:26] But you're still CEO

[07:28] If you're still CEO

[07:30] Every business needs a CEO right every business needs somebody who's driving the business if you're just not involved in the quote

[07:36] Day-to-day you still want a hundred percent have a job. It's just not time oriented

[07:39] But you still a hundred percent have a job

[07:41] But what you need is to make sure that you get your attention back and the only to get your attention back

[07:45] So let someone else have the attention of running the business which is

[07:49] Making sure that you can then move up and then you can make your network your portfolio your assets the one thing

[07:56] Right, and so any who all of us have a woman in the red dress

[07:59] Right that five million dollar your entrepreneur all of us had that quick win that we want to have because we have some level of demand that's there

[08:07] But you have to say now at least that's my my two cents. That's my my experiences

[08:11] You have to see no until you get to the point where even when you start that new thing right starting anything

[08:16] You're not starting new thing you are assembling the team that's going to pursue this opportunity on your behalf

[08:21] Think about like to think about the language on that you're not gonna go start another business

[08:25] You're going to go assemble a team that's going to pursue that opportunity because you think it's worth pursuing

[08:31] Think about that way right or you acquire a business or a percentage of a business and then you help assist that team

[08:37] Grow and pursue that opportunity that is how owner speak versus CEOs

[08:42] Right that is how you go from self employed to owner and most of us

[08:47] Especially you know younger entrepreneurs and I'm not saying there I say younger nine in terms of age

[08:51] I just say in terms of experience there are still self employed. You're seeing yeah, but you're still self employed

[08:55] Right, and I think that if you can make that and you can swallow your pride about saying like oh, I have this business

[09:00] And you just realize that

[09:02] Then you'll you'll be much more successful

[09:05] So let's go back to the very beginning to wrap this puppy up

[09:07] If you have lots of little things in your business and you have one big thing that's really the majority of your your income

[09:13] If you cut out all of these other things and make your business so simple it would be unreasonable or you've

[09:18] Unreasonable for you not to be successful if you do that then you probably will be successful because you would be on reason for you not to but the thing is is it's hard

[09:26] Not because it's complicated

[09:29] But because it forces us to go against our human nature and I think if you can think about things like that like Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett

[09:35] Like they don't spend that much time working

[09:38] Right they spend their time making good decisions which doesn't take that much time

[09:42] Which takes a lot of intelligent or sorry a lot of good displearning character traits, right?

[09:46] And so if you look at what they do if I think about that like just because something is simple doesn't mean it's not the right call

[09:53] Simple scales fancy fails and I'll leave you with that I can tell you right now. We make more money

[09:58] Like we make a lot of money right now and we really don't do a ton and it's because I had to change my beliefs about like

[10:06] We we we do these things because we have these interpersonal needs we have these character traits

[10:10] We have these deficiencies that we we choose to fill with our business and our activities because we don't want to be alone with our thoughts

[10:16] But if you can

[10:17] Let your business just continue to run and not go in and mess things up because you've gotten that point

[10:22] You've put you know a CEO in place you will be best served and so anyways

[10:26] Stop being so fancy simple scales fancy fails and if you're not at that point then be okay with not being at that point

[10:32] Don't be too good to run your own business

[10:34] Don't feel like oh I have to do what I'm just doing because everything has to be done in sequence until you until you know

[10:39] How to get to owner you shouldn't try and do that yet to be successful

[10:43] So anyways, I'll be you enjoy this

[10:45] confront the hard work and the hard work a lot of times is simple work it's simple decisions that we have to make don't take the quick wins

[10:52] Think long aggressive patience

[10:54] Mac rule perspective and I think that I think that we'll all ultimately be the better for it at least these journals

[11:01] These little vlogs are for me to write down the principles that that I made

[11:05] Given us disproportionate returns and I hope to share them with you. Most of your nation keeping awesome kitchen next video

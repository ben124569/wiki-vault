[00:00] Conner Regregor came off proper 12th.

[00:01] Boom, it was a $600 million deal.

[00:03] The rock had terror monoticula,

[00:05] which is now worth like 4 billion.

[00:06] Kylie made the front of Forbes as a billionaire

[00:10] and she was 20.

[00:11] Mr. Beast, he will be a sense of billionaire.

[00:12] Right now, the entire economy has shifted.

[00:15] The last century was a century about the power.

[00:17] And when I say power, I mean like energy.

[00:19] The wealthiest individuals of the last century

[00:21] were built on oil.

[00:22] The biggest companies were all energy companies.

[00:25] Fast forward today.

[00:26] 4 out of the top five biggest companies in the world

[00:30] are not built on the old oil, but the new oil.

[00:33] And the oil of today is attention.

[00:35] The rise in teens on TikToks,

[00:37] the thing that is being pumped and drilled every day

[00:40] is the attention of the masses.

[00:43] You have 24 hours a day that your ears are open.

[00:45] You have 24 hours a day that your eyes are open.

[00:47] And so the idea is, how can we capture

[00:49] as many of those hours from as many people

[00:52] as possible and the war for our minds?

[00:55] For me, the stuff is all about helping people connect.

[00:59] The total amount of attention that exists

[01:01] is every human's eyes and ears collectively 24 hours a day.

[01:04] That is the pie and they're fighting for it.

[01:06] People who are creating the platforms

[01:08] that other companies can come and drill,

[01:10] they're basically the digital landscape.

[01:12] They envelope the world.

[01:14] They're literally buying up the real estate

[01:15] of the collective attention that exists.

[01:18] The oil type who intended to go and buy a state,

[01:21] negotiate, haggle with the farmer to get his things,

[01:24] the new world today, they don't need to haggle with anyone.

[01:26] They just take it.

[01:27] The scarce resources are the things that are the most valuable.

[01:30] And so oil was the scarce resource.

[01:32] And now, attention is the scarce resource.

[01:35] And so that's why attention is the new oil.

[01:38] A friend of mine, Ryan Fisher,

[01:40] just should be a clip on his phone,

[01:42] a podcast that I did with him.

[01:43] This is when I wasn't really, actually,

[01:45] I didn't do any podcast.

[01:46] I wasn't doing any speaking stuff.

[01:48] Like all I was doing is building gym lunch prestige labs.

[01:50] I was like screw content, just run ads.

[01:53] I don't want to be known.

[01:55] I want to be rich and unknown.

[01:57] It's funny because he was like,

[01:58] and now you're not doing that,

[01:59] I was very against it.

[02:01] And then what happened?

[02:02] Kylie made the front of Forbes as a billionaire

[02:05] and she was 20.

[02:07] And at the time, I was 27.

[02:08] And I think I had taken home 17 million

[02:10] and income near before.

[02:12] I was on pace to do like 13 to 15

[02:13] that next year in terms of take home.

[02:15] And I thought like I was hot shit.

[02:16] And then this girl, seven years younger than me,

[02:19] fucking crushes me in net worth.

[02:22] And I was like, wow.

[02:24] And so it was just this huge belief shift for me.

[02:26] I was like, what am I doing wrong?

[02:28] My ego felt hurt.

[02:30] So I started protecting myself.

[02:31] And I was like, oh no, Chris Jenner's her mom.

[02:33] She's an absolute gangster.

[02:35] She was born into this royalty.

[02:36] It's not that she did it.

[02:37] It was someone else and Bob Obama.

[02:38] ego protected.

[02:39] I feel okay now.

[02:40] And then, who did beauty?

[02:42] So a percentage of her think for 600 million

[02:44] at the time is worth over billion today.

[02:46] Conner Gregor came off proper 12 when 12 months later.

[02:49] Boom, it was a $600 million deal.

[02:51] Robots Whale.

[02:52] And then the rock had terror monoticula,

[02:54] which is now worth like $4 billion.

[02:55] It's kept seeing this again.

[02:56] And again and again, to the point where I was like,

[02:59] I believe something that's not true.

[03:02] And so I talk about how skills, beliefs,

[03:04] character traits are the three things

[03:05] that hold back entrepreneurs.

[03:06] And this one for me was something

[03:08] that I believed about the world.

[03:09] And I was functioning as though.

[03:11] And it was not.

[03:12] I always try and find those things

[03:13] because they construct our reality.

[03:14] And we make our decision space

[03:16] and the things that we believe to be true.

[03:17] And so I basically was walking through reality

[03:19] that was not real.

[03:20] I then read a bookmind of all robocowaches

[03:22] is Almanac.

[03:23] I was just really good, really quick read.

[03:25] And you talked about the four types of leverage

[03:26] in the book, leveraged the difference

[03:27] in what you put in and what you get out

[03:29] the people who make the most money

[03:30] or the ones who have the most leverage

[03:31] because everybody has same amount of time.

[03:32] It's just who gets the most back for their time.

[03:33] And compounding is that now that you've made that trade

[03:35] with your leverage, is it going to compound

[03:37] unto itself and get you even more back?

[03:39] Because compounding is a form of leverage.

[03:41] And you've got a laborer.

[03:42] You get other people to do stuff for it.

[03:44] Which means you give more of your time back

[03:45] and you get output above that.

[03:47] You've got capital.

[03:48] So people give you money.

[03:49] You invest the money that other people give you

[03:51] and you get leverage by extension.

[03:52] The last two levels are code.

[03:54] So you got software and media.

[03:56] So if you think about this,

[03:57] you make a piece of code and then 10 million people can use it.

[03:59] That's leverage.

[04:00] You put one time investment.

[04:01] You get infinite on the other side.

[04:03] With media it's the same way.

[04:04] If I take how much time it takes me to make this video,

[04:06] one person, a million people, 100 million people

[04:09] can see this video, which is what gives it leverage.

[04:11] And when I saw that, that was what made everything click for me

[04:14] as to why these people were given

[04:16] these crazy crazy numbers when they had like I had

[04:19] her Kylie had a team of seven.

[04:20] And she was doing 200 million a year.

[04:22] I was like team of seven.

[04:24] And it was because she had a compounding leverage

[04:27] vehicle built within her business.

[04:29] And that was when I looked at my own businesses at the time

[04:31] and realized I had nothing that compounded.

[04:33] Nothing.

[04:34] I almost became dissatisfied with the business that I had

[04:36] because I realized that whatever I wanted to do next,

[04:38] I wanted to have a compounding vehicle,

[04:40] something that multiplies unto itself over and over again.

[04:44] So Warren Buffett could build Berkshire Hathaway

[04:46] because the money itself compounds and compounds

[04:49] and all the long enough time rising

[04:50] when you keep rolling the snowball,

[04:52] after you do that for 40, 50 years,

[04:54] you have a big fucking snowball.

[04:55] You have to unlock one of those four types of leverage.

[04:58] And so when I looked at that pyramid,

[05:00] I was like, well, I understand the leverage of labor.

[05:02] So I've got that.

[05:03] I'm now in a position where I have capital that I can deploy.

[05:05] Now, I don't have other people's capital

[05:07] because that's not what I want to do with my life right now.

[05:08] But when I looked at software and media,

[05:10] I was like, given my skills, et cetera,

[05:12] I could be better at the media side

[05:13] than I could at the code side.

[05:15] But I still wasn't there yet.

[05:16] I looked at these people that are ultra-famous

[05:18] and it sounds like, huh, well, I still rather be anonymous

[05:20] because they've got all these stockers and weirdos,

[05:23] a good morning, can I?

[05:24] Jack the fuck up.

[05:25] When you get exposed to 10 million people,

[05:27] if you figure 1% of people are crazy,

[05:28] you've got 100,000 weirdos.

[05:30] Anyways, I go to have dinner with front of mine,

[05:32] Dean Graciosi, who's he gets like weirdos

[05:34] that can do his house on all like that stuff.

[05:35] And I was like, how do you deal with this?

[05:37] I was like, why do you think this,

[05:38] like, how is this worth it?

[05:39] You just have me down, he was like,

[05:41] dude, if a couple weird letters,

[05:44] you know, every day, every week is the price

[05:47] I have to pay for the impact I wanna have,

[05:49] he's like, I pay that price any day

[05:51] that we can twice on Sunday.

[05:53] And there was just like this pause when he said it,

[05:55] between when he said it and we looked at me

[05:57] and I just felt like it hit me

[05:58] because I was like, God, I'm being such a pansy.

[06:00] I wanna make real business education available to everyone.

[06:02] If I say that that's what I actually wanna do,

[06:04] then I need to match my actions to that.

[06:06] Otherwise, they're just empty words.

[06:07] I hate doing something that I don't get credit for later.

[06:10] And so the idea of making a short

[06:13] that is going to float today

[06:15] and then disappear into the ether tomorrow, right?

[06:17] Or make a post on Instagram that's gonna be gone

[06:20] in a week, like no one's ever gonna see it again.

[06:22] To me taking the scarce resources of my time

[06:24] and then having it vanish, I couldn't make that work for me.

[06:27] It was a huge belief that I realized

[06:30] the content is not the output, is the input.

[06:34] The output is the audience.

[06:37] And the audience is what compounds,

[06:39] the audience is what sticks.

[06:41] You're gathering the scarce resource

[06:43] and the audience is the thing that pumps attention

[06:46] over and over again.

[06:47] You've got Mr. Beast.

[06:48] I think he opened up a restaurant in a local area

[06:50] at 10,000 people show up at a local restaurant.

[06:54] I don't think people realize that he's 24 and media compounds.

[06:57] I will make prediction that he will be a sense of billionaire.

[07:00] Not just the billionaire, but a sense of billionaire.

[07:02] And so becoming a master of media is a huge way

[07:06] of creating leverage because if Kylie can just point

[07:09] and then you have 100 million people who buy anything,

[07:14] you have a billion dollar plus company.

[07:15] But once that shifted in me,

[07:17] I'd stop seeing it as a waste because I thought,

[07:19] if I got one more person who's gonna see this short

[07:22] or see this long or see this poster, see this tweeter,

[07:25] see this whatever, that was the point.

[07:27] The reason Puda, the rock,

[07:29] Conner McGregor, Kylie were able to translate their attention

[07:33] into money, one, they spent a long time building it.

[07:36] And amassing that attention because they knew

[07:38] that the moment they did decide to monetize it,

[07:41] it was right there.

[07:42] Think about how long the rock has been building the brand

[07:45] of the rock before he signed his deal with Under Arm before.

[07:47] He made term on it before he made Zoa.

[07:49] 20 years, he'd been building this brand.

[07:51] People piss and moan about the fact that,

[07:53] they post it content for four weeks and they're not famous yet.

[07:56] One is they waited a really, really, really long time

[07:58] and they didn't ask, they just, they gave,

[08:00] they give to their particular audience.

[08:01] The longer you can wait, the bigger they ask can be at the end.

[08:04] The longer the runway, the bigger the plane

[08:06] that can take off from it.

[08:07] The next thing is that the thing they chose to monetize

[08:09] from was on brand.

[08:11] This is something that their audience already dug.

[08:13] The rock signing the deal with Under Armmer

[08:16] makes complete sense because fitness is a core part

[08:18] of his brand.

[08:19] It's about drive, it's about power, we stay hungry, we devour.

[08:22] Like all of that is something that Under Armmer

[08:24] wanted to tap into to associate their brand with.

[08:27] The biggest brands that exist come from the endorsements

[08:30] of celebrities.

[08:31] We can't be Kim Kardashian, a girl can't be Kim.

[08:34] So Kim is the ultimate status.

[08:36] Then, Dolchinkobana signs Kim and says, where are she?

[08:40] People then see the status that Kim has

[08:42] and associate it with Dolchinkobana.

[08:44] And then little lady who's got money

[08:46] and doesn't have status trades her money

[08:48] for the bag that she can associate with Kim

[08:50] to get the status.

[08:51] That's the game.

[08:52] Let's look at LeBron and Nike.

[08:54] They wanted to sign him because they figured

[08:56] he is going to be iconic.

[08:57] He is iconic, right?

[08:58] And they wanted to associate Nike victory

[09:01] with somebody who's victorious.

[09:02] Because the brands can't be victorious

[09:04] and it's not a person.

[09:05] So they got to find the people who embody

[09:07] the spirit and the values of their brand.

[09:09] They make the endorsement.

[09:10] People make the association their mind

[09:12] and then they buy the brand to get the association

[09:14] of the thing they could never do but always aspire to.

[09:17] The people who are the most famous

[09:18] do you look at Rogan?

[09:20] He's got UFC.

[09:21] He's also a really amazing comedian

[09:23] and loves the comedy community.

[09:25] Fitness and biohacking and supplements

[09:27] and like brain stuff.

[09:28] He loves all that stuff.

[09:29] Aliens and UFOs.

[09:30] And these are all totally different

[09:32] but the more dimensions that someone can go deep on.

[09:34] The more they'll get an audience from comedy

[09:36] and then they'll cross-pondate them with fighting.

[09:38] But it's this total combination

[09:40] which ultimately compounds the audience even faster.

[09:43] And so these mega stars go deep on many things

[09:45] and capture bigger and bigger audiences

[09:47] that compound on themselves.

[09:48] And they wait because they stay loyal to their brand

[09:51] and then they appeal to a segment of their audience

[09:53] or they try to cut across the one

[09:55] that appeals to the most of them.

[09:57] It took me way too long to realize

[09:59] that the game had changed fundamentally

[10:01] if the Rockefeller's were built on oil.

[10:03] The new generation of people

[10:04] are going to build on attention.

[10:06] Media will only become more expensive over time.

[10:08] The advertising becomes more expensive.

[10:09] Content creation becomes more expensive.

[10:11] It becomes increasingly fragmented

[10:12] to have cost more to do it across different platforms.

[10:14] The audience becomes more valuable.

[10:15] The cost of getting the audience becomes more valuable

[10:17] which means the best time to start is now.

[10:19] The people who will become the new sense of billionaires

[10:22] etc is going to be people who are going to do three things.

[10:24] They will be able to capture,

[10:25] if they will hold, they have to be able to multiply attention.

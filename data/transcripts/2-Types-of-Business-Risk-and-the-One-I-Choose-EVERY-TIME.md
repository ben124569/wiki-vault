[00:00] There are two big risks that exist in business.

[00:02] The first is the execution risk.

[00:04] The second is the idea risk.

[00:06] Now you can maybe make an argument for a third being

[00:09] environmental risk regulatory risk things like that.

[00:11] But I would say big picture is,

[00:13] does the idea fundamentally work?

[00:15] Is having strangers drive kids around in cars

[00:17] going to be a really good idea over, right?

[00:19] Or creating lockers for cats?

[00:21] Is that going to be a good idea?

[00:22] I don't know, right?

[00:23] Or am I going to be able to execute the idea itself?

[00:26] And if you don't know why I am,

[00:27] my name is Alex Mozi, I am an acquisition.com.

[00:29] I'm going to put full-life companies to deliver $100 a year.

[00:31] I like talking about business stuff,

[00:32] and hopefully making fewer people broke in the world,

[00:35] makes me die happy.

[00:36] OK, so I was having a really good conversation

[00:38] with a friend of mine who's a software entrepreneur.

[00:41] He's had three or four software companies.

[00:42] None of them have really hit.

[00:44] And he's about the same age as me.

[00:45] And he and I sit in very different financial positions

[00:47] at this point in our life.

[00:48] And we were having a really in-depth conversation

[00:50] around this topic, which is appropriately measuring risk.

[00:54] And so one of the issues that I see with a lot of new

[00:56] raw entrepreneurs is that they overestimate the payoff

[00:59] for a risk and underestimate the cost number one.

[01:02] And second, is they overestimate the likelihood

[01:05] of success they're going to have,

[01:06] and they underestimate the risk

[01:08] in terms of the likelihood that they fail.

[01:09] And I think this is really interesting, because he and I

[01:11] were discussing the first quote that I have.

[01:13] It's kind of, it's in the intro of my book by Jeff Basis.

[01:16] I'll read it to you right now.

[01:17] Outside's returns often come from betting against conventional

[01:20] wisdom and conventional wisdom is usually right.

[01:22] Given 10% chance of a hundred times payoff,

[01:24] you should take that bet every time.

[01:25] So you're still going to be wrong nine times out of 10.

[01:27] We all know that if you swing for the fences,

[01:29] you're going to strike out a lot.

[01:30] But if you're also going to hit some home runs,

[01:32] the difference between baseball and business, however,

[01:33] is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution.

[01:36] When you swing, no matter how well you can act with the ball,

[01:38] the most runs you can get is four.

[01:39] In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate,

[01:42] you can score 1,000 runs.

[01:43] This long-tailed distribution of returns,

[01:45] it's why it's important to be bold.

[01:46] Big winners pay for so many experiments.

[01:48] Jeff Basis.

[01:49] And so the thing is is that there are two big costs

[01:52] when you're making these risks.

[01:53] One is you've got the money and things like that.

[01:55] But I think the biggest cost is time.

[01:56] And so if you think about portfolio theory,

[01:58] which is, for example, like venture capital,

[02:00] VCs, though, let's say they take 50 companies on.

[02:03] And they're betting the fact that one of those 50 companies

[02:05] is going to, you know, 100x.

[02:07] And pretty much carry the return to the entire portfolio.

[02:09] And for the vast majority of the other ones,

[02:11] they either go out of business or basically not really do

[02:13] anything spectacular.

[02:14] And so for the VC for the venture capital investor,

[02:17] it makes sense to take this approach

[02:19] because they're going to get very good returns

[02:21] using, you know, using this method.

[02:23] Whereas if you are one of the 49, you know, founders

[02:27] who has pretty much all of the net worth investing this thing

[02:29] and it takes five years of your life away to only fail,

[02:32] it can be harder to swallow.

[02:34] And so he and I've had very different careers and lives.

[02:37] And it's because we value risk differently.

[02:39] Now, he would say that he is not interested in making money

[02:42] and he just wants to do something really big and really cool.

[02:44] I tend to be more money focused or money driven

[02:47] whatever you want to say.

[02:48] Because I think that the accumulation of money will

[02:50] allow me to do really cool things later on in my life

[02:52] and when I say later, I mean, like, you know, give me 20, 30 years

[02:56] of doing this and I think we can do that.

[02:57] Now, the reason that I want to bring up this topic

[02:59] is because picking the business that you're going to go after

[03:01] I think is a very important question.

[03:02] You're going to ask yourself.

[03:03] And you have to understand that you're probably going to fail

[03:05] many times before you are successful.

[03:07] And one of the hardest questions in entrepreneurship

[03:09] and this is also one of the things

[03:10] that come up in the conversation is,

[03:11] when do I push or when do I pivot?

[03:13] Right, when do I keep pushing, when do I keep persevering

[03:15] on this idea that's not quite working?

[03:17] And when do I pivot?

[03:17] And it's one of the hardest questions in entrepreneurship

[03:19] because you don't know whether it's you or the idea.

[03:23] And that's what's hard.

[03:24] Because sometimes it's like, how many great business ideas

[03:26] have the founders have abandoned six inches from gold

[03:29] where they just needed to push a little bit harder

[03:31] and they were going to have the breakthrough.

[03:32] And I hesitate to talk about the subjects.

[03:33] I think most people just don't know how to push it all.

[03:35] And so, you know, I put that as a big caveat.

[03:37] Now, when we're talking about business in general,

[03:39] I, and this is my difference from my friend,

[03:41] I prefer to only go after ideas

[03:43] that I think have virtually no risk of not being ideas

[03:46] that people want, which then leaves only me as the variable,

[03:49] the execution risk that it can be done well.

[03:51] It can be well business.

[03:53] Right?

[03:54] And so, I think in a lot of ways,

[03:55] this is just Alex's two cents.

[03:56] Most newer entrepreneurs, I think, would be better served

[03:59] going after boring businesses that have established needs.

[04:03] So people want to have businesses want more customers.

[04:06] People want to make more money.

[04:07] People want higher paying jobs.

[04:09] People want to have skills that are valuable.

[04:11] People want to lose weight.

[04:12] People want entertainment.

[04:14] Like these are all things that are not going to change

[04:15] in real time.

[04:16] And so what that allows you to do is hone your skills

[04:19] at business because you know if it doesn't work,

[04:21] it's only you.

[04:22] It's only your fault if it doesn't work.

[04:23] Right? And so, because the problem is

[04:24] that having the perspective

[04:25] for much to make a judgment on whether you have product market

[04:28] that can be, I think, a much harder decision

[04:30] of when to push and when to pivot.

[04:31] Right? And as a total side note,

[04:33] because I think this is really interesting,

[04:34] I think there's three big questions that are really

[04:35] dichotomies that you have to manage as an entrepreneur.

[04:38] Right? One is when to push and when to pivot.

[04:40] The second is how much do I consume versus how much do I invest?

[04:42] Right? Because you're going to be living your whole life.

[04:44] If you always forego the immediate satisfaction,

[04:47] you may reach the end of your life

[04:48] and never have enjoyed anything.

[04:49] Right? So there's a little bit of a balance there

[04:51] that you have to strike. Right?

[04:52] And it probably shifts over time,

[04:54] but there's still means that there's some level of consumption

[04:56] even early on in your life.

[04:57] And at the same time, you also don't know if you're going to live

[04:58] tomorrow. Right? And that's where it gets really interesting.

[05:00] And it's a personal question. Right?

[05:02] And the third is kind of the balance between like how much do I

[05:05] delegate to other people versus how much do I do?

[05:07] Right? Because you got to do something.

[05:09] And you can delegate everything. Right?

[05:10] Like, and so there's balance is here.

[05:11] And so today is just about the push and the pivot

[05:14] and idea risk versus execution risk.

[05:16] And so for the new launch winners,

[05:17] you probably suck at business.

[05:19] And that's okay. And that's because you're new,

[05:20] which is totally reasonable, totally acceptable.

[05:22] And of course you should suck because it's hard.

[05:23] And a lot of people do it. Right?

[05:24] And if you want to be in the top 1%

[05:26] it's 1% of people.

[05:26] That means you have to beat 99 other people out of 100.

[05:28] In order to be the top 1%,

[05:29] which is only 400,000 years. Right?

[05:31] Not only it's a lot of money. Right?

[05:32] And so the thing is is that Instagram makes everyone feel like

[05:34] if you're not making money,

[05:35] don't you? You're poor, which is not true.

[05:36] You can save 400,000 years for not that long

[05:39] and have a lot of money.

[05:41] You don't even mean. And so anyways, back to the point.

[05:43] If you're picking businesses, the difference that he and I had

[05:47] for super big, they wanted to go change the world and whatnot.

[05:50] But what I don't think we see or appropriately

[05:52] that risk or value is the graveyard.

[05:54] Full of people who went big and struck out.

[05:57] And I think is an interesting caveat to this.

[05:59] Jeff Bacos gives this example.

[06:00] And I want to dive into it in a little bit more detail.

[06:02] Let's zoom out for a second.

[06:04] Let's eliminate Jeff Bacos, Elon Musk, Warren Buffett,

[06:06] from the names that you haven't had.

[06:07] If we were to think, what would be required

[06:10] to be number one in the world at a thing?

[06:12] Right? You'd have to have the natural proclivity, right?

[06:14] Because if you're committing it's everybody,

[06:15] the people who are going to have natural advantages,

[06:17] based on genetic code, upbringing, whatever,

[06:20] are going to win more.

[06:21] So that'd be the first thing we'd want

[06:22] if we wanted to create this person who's going to be likely to win.

[06:25] Number two is they'd have to have a tremendous amount of skill.

[06:27] So they'd have the natural proclivity, the nurture that created

[06:30] in environment where they had work ethic to pursue the skill.

[06:33] So they have to be very, very good.

[06:34] And third, they'd have to be lucky.

[06:36] Because if you think about a whole bunch of people,

[06:38] like imagine everybody who's born really,

[06:40] has natural tendencies or proclivities towards these activities.

[06:43] And then does a ton of it in terms of volume.

[06:45] So they get very good.

[06:46] What then separates them?

[06:48] Look, right?

[06:49] The people at the very, very, very top

[06:50] have all of the things aligned, come up and look.

[06:53] And so it's interesting that he has this quote around risk

[06:56] because one of the things that's unique about basos

[06:59] and even Elon, right?

[06:59] And this is probably a further discussion

[07:02] on business strategy overall

[07:03] is that they've had virtually limitless access to capital, right?

[07:06] Like as in they can basically raise money endlessly

[07:10] to fund these risks, right?

[07:12] And so the equation that he said, which is a magic

[07:14] go to Vegas casino and there's a table that has

[07:17] a 10% chance of winning, but you get a hundred times

[07:19] payout when you did, right?

[07:20] If you can play the game on an unlimited time horizon,

[07:23] then you absolutely should just play it

[07:25] play it as many times as easily possible, right?

[07:27] But most of us do not have unlimited spins, right?

[07:29] And that's where this gets more interesting.

[07:31] And so if you were to imagine a dollar as a year of life,

[07:35] okay, that you have in your entrepreneur career.

[07:36] And let's say to build something really epic

[07:39] would take 10 years.

[07:40] And that's like minimum.

[07:41] You know what I mean?

[07:42] Facebook was 20 years old now, right?

[07:43] Which is kind of insane to think about.

[07:45] I think it's 20 years old.

[07:46] Is it 20 years old?

[07:47] I feel like it's 20 years old.

[07:48] It's pretty old.

[07:48] 15 years old?

[07:49] It's pretty old, right?

[07:50] Let's just say 15, right?

[07:51] If you want to build something epic, which means

[07:53] and how long does it take to test the idea before moving on, right?

[07:57] That's another big question.

[07:58] Like how long does it take to really give it your all on a thing?

[08:00] And so we were having the discussion.

[08:02] And he said, I think we should say $35 would be,

[08:05] you know, you have 35 years of life.

[08:07] And you know, how long do we, do we chunk?

[08:09] And we agreed on five years as a midground.

[08:11] Cause it takes 15 to really, you know, see something all the way through.

[08:14] If we said 15 was the chunk, that didn't seem realistic.

[08:17] Cause it doesn't take you 15 years to find out something doesn't work, right?

[08:19] And so it's that bad.

[08:20] So we said five was the number you can come up with your own right?

[08:23] And so a more realistic way to see this, right?

[08:26] Would be, you know, you've got to one at a 10 shot at 100 times pay out.

[08:30] But the minimum bet is five.

[08:31] And you've got 35 bucks.

[08:33] Interesting, right?

[08:34] The conversation changed.

[08:35] Now, let's say that you're now 15 years in.

[08:36] Let's see you bet three times you lost all three times,

[08:38] which would be reasonable.

[08:39] That would be expected that you lose three times.

[08:41] You could even lose all three of the first times.

[08:42] But I have 15 years in and you have still no money.

[08:45] Huh?

[08:45] How do you feel about yourself, right?

[08:47] How do you feel about your skill?

[08:48] What's your reputation?

[08:49] All these things kind of weigh in.

[08:50] You know what I mean?

[08:51] And this is why I think this is really interesting to discuss it.

[08:53] And so I will give you my two cents because he and I disagree on these things.

[08:56] Because I have the perspective that all the people that I know are the wealthies in the world

[08:59] eliminate risk.

[09:00] So that's what they do.

[09:01] They control risk.

[09:01] They, they, they virtually eliminate.

[09:03] They figure out ways to play the game in new ways where they cannot lose.

[09:06] Right?

[09:06] I'll give you an example.

[09:07] If the rock came out with

[09:09] a, I'm trying to think of something you hasn't come out with because you come out with

[09:11] payroll and whatever.

[09:12] Let's see, you came out with, let's see, you came out with a book, right?

[09:15] Let's see, let's see, the rock writes a book.

[09:17] Maybe you already has written a book.

[09:18] I don't know.

[09:19] And he writes a book.

[09:20] What's the likelihood that it's not a best seller?

[09:21] Virtually zero, right?

[09:22] It's virtually zero.

[09:23] So he's basically eliminated the risk because you control some of the variable.

[09:25] She is a massive audience, right?

[09:26] And you can build that deliberately.

[09:28] And so when we think about these things, the richest people that I know control risk and only

[09:31] play games where if they wait, they win.

[09:33] And my friend has not taken that approach and he's like, hey, I just want to go bigger

[09:37] and go home.

[09:38] And the thing is, is that he's gone home or then he's gone big.

[09:40] And so I, I will give you Alex's two cents and you can choose to do what you want with it.

[09:44] And I'll just explain my views on risk.

[09:45] I tend to go with the highest likelihood bet.

[09:49] And I tend to, if I have two bets, let's say one where I have a 10x payoff for a, you know,

[09:55] one out of two shots, right?

[09:57] Which would be a two to one risk adjusted return.

[09:59] All right, if you curious you just multiply the payoff by the, by the likelihood.

[10:02] Or is that a 5x?

[10:03] Sorry, I've messed that up.

[10:04] But you get the idea.

[10:05] You multiply the payoff by the percentage likelihood.

[10:07] And if I had an equivalent risk adjusted return in another one, but I had a higher likelihood

[10:11] of achieving it.

[10:12] So if I had a 5x that I, or a 6x that I thought I had a 4 out of 5 chance of getting versus

[10:16] a 10x that I had on all the math on it, but whatever, or one out of two shot of getting,

[10:20] I would pick the the 4 out of 5 shot that had a lower upside.

[10:23] That's me.

[10:24] And I think part of that is because the games that are set up that way are usually going

[10:28] to be just execution risk businesses.

[10:29] And I feel like I can, I can pay that down in other ways.

[10:32] When I had I can pay down that risk so I can virtually nothing's guaranteed.

[10:35] But I can virtually guarantee the outcome.

[10:37] And so my goal is to string as many of these virtually guaranteed upsides in my favor for

[10:44] a long enough period of time that I let compounding work.

[10:47] Because compounding on a long enough time rise and creates the outsides return.

[10:51] And so the idea is how can I play, how can I get as many w's in a row?

[10:55] And as few else as possible for a long enough time rise in so that I create the outsides

[11:00] return comma and get delivered pretty cool and stress free, you're not stress free.

[11:05] But like a pretty cool life along the way.

[11:07] Right now if we played the game the way that we talked about earlier where you have the

[11:09] 35 years that you can bet and your three bets in, your 15 years in and you don't have anything

[11:14] that can be pretty hard.

[11:15] Harder and you go, hard to reputation, maybe you learn bad habit.

[11:18] Like there's a lot of things because you won't know, especially if there's an idea risk

[11:21] that's at hand like is it me or was it the idea?

[11:24] And so for that reason I'm in favor of the significantly lower risk and he and I were talking

[11:28] back and forth.

[11:29] He's like you know what I've observed from you is that you just you go for the shirt

[11:31] thing.

[11:32] And that's 100% what I do.

[11:33] That is I've always gone for the shirt thing.

[11:34] And then I just continue to try and trade up the upside of my shirt things.

[11:39] Right.

[11:40] So the first shirt thing you can have is a very high paying income job.

[11:43] And then the next shirt thing would be like if I were to quit a job I would make sure

[11:46] that I had more income from my side hustle probably where I believed it would be very

[11:50] reasonable for me to get that you know within a very short period of time.

[11:52] So then I would you know make maybe that switch and then I would look at you know all the

[11:55] opportunities that existed and think okay what of these things on a risk adjusted basis.

[11:59] And this is again where people make you know errors like just assume like you have to

[12:03] take the negative assumptions and I'd say like the the better I get at this at thinking

[12:07] this way the more I continue to make which is I'm going to assume everything goes wrong

[12:12] what then do I make right and so if you can just say like assuming none of the good things

[12:16] that you think are reasonable or going to happen happen can you still win.

[12:20] And I think when you think that way what happens is you give yourself room to be pleasantly

[12:23] surprised and exceed expectations.

[12:26] But what happens is when you set up the game that way where you're like I'm assuming

[12:29] these are the five things that I think will happen and will go right.

[12:32] But I'm assuming none of them are going to go right.

[12:34] Do I still win?

[12:35] And if you could still win then that is an opportunity to worth pursuing in my opinion.

[12:39] And so that's that has been the approach that I have taken which is how can I virtually

[12:44] eliminate downside risk.

[12:45] How can I eliminate idea risk and how can I and when I say virtually eliminate downside

[12:49] I meant to say the execution risk.

[12:50] So how can I eliminate idea risk by only going after things that people already know

[12:54] want and then how can I stack the chips in my favor like the rock where if I want to write

[12:58] a book I want to make sure it's a best seller no matter what right.

[13:01] How do I do that and then think about all the things that can go wrong.

[13:04] Assume they go wrong and then think what would I do in order to still succeed even with all

[13:07] these things to go wrong.

[13:08] And then I think when you take those actions you may not hit the thousand extra turn.

[13:12] But let's paint a different game that you could play.

[13:15] So let's say you could play there's there's the two games one was the one that Jeff

[13:18] based is outlined right which you got you know one out of ten shot at getting a hundred

[13:22] times pay off.

[13:23] The game that I prefer to play is how can I get a three x pay off with a 95% chance

[13:28] of certainty.

[13:29] And I still have the same 35 right minimum bet.

[13:30] Well I'll bet five and get my three and then I'll bet my 15 I'll get it now get 45 and

[13:36] then I'll bet my 45 and I'll be at up there we go.

[13:39] I'm already at 120 whatever.

[13:41] So I got my hundred times pay off by thinking about it from a risk adjusted basis.

[13:44] Now it's not going to be sexy.

[13:46] It's not.

[13:47] But if you double or triple or five x things enough times you get to the hundred x very

[13:51] quickly and you can do it with limited downside knowing that you've controlled for the

[13:55] idea risk and have only focused on the execution risk which is yourself.

[13:58] And so that's how I've thought about risk with opportunity that I thought I would share

[14:02] with you because it was really cool conversation.

[14:04] I hope it gave you some light in terms of at least how I think of things and maybe some

[14:09] of those ideas could serve you.

[00:00] Getting other people to do what you want is

[00:02] are really the most important skill

[00:04] because if you have that one skill, it unlocks every other skill

[00:07] that every other person potentially has.

[00:09] The problem is other people don't always do what you want them to do.

[00:12] So I'm gonna share a five step framework

[00:14] that I call the star system

[00:15] that you can use to influence other people.

[00:17] So let's paint the scene.

[00:18] You say, hey Kyle, I need you to make me that TPS report

[00:23] by Monday.

[00:24] Monday comes, Kyle doesn't have the TPS report.

[00:27] What do you do?

[00:28] I'm gonna make this really simple.

[00:29] Number one, did you know that I wanted you

[00:31] to give me that TPS report?

[00:33] And he might be like, oh, I thought we were just talking.

[00:35] Now, you might hear that, think, what an arrogant ass.

[00:38] No, but let's be real for a second.

[00:39] Like, you probably don't follow up on a lot of stuff

[00:43] that you tell people to do.

[00:44] And what do you think people learn?

[00:46] But if you don't follow up, it's like, oh,

[00:48] it probably wasn't that important to him.

[00:49] And if you mentioned it two, three, four, five times, they're like,

[00:51] okay, this is something I actually have to do.

[00:53] The solution for that problem is you write it.

[00:58] All right, and so one of the things that we have

[01:00] in TurtleLagwester.com is if it isn't written, it never happened.

[01:04] If you just have a verbal conversation that exists,

[01:06] IRL, just in the air, it doesn't ever matter.

[01:10] Because no one has proof of it.

[01:12] You don't have proof of it.

[01:13] They don't remember it.

[01:13] You remember it differently than them.

[01:14] This is why crystallizing those experiences so important

[01:17] because then you can point back to it.

[01:18] That way everyone's on the same page.

[01:19] Hey, I thought you said you want me the Cindy, the KPI's

[01:22] by Monday.

[01:23] I said the TPS report.

[01:24] It's like, oh, well, I hear the KPI's.

[01:26] It's like, best of what I asked for.

[01:28] But how do we know?

[01:28] Maybe you did say KPI.

[01:30] Like how many times have you said something,

[01:31] thought you said something different?

[01:32] How is all time?

[01:33] Number one, set the frame that these are the five reasons.

[01:35] And be like, hey, Kyle, you didn't do it.

[01:37] So did you not know that?

[01:38] I wanted you to do it?

[01:39] I didn't know.

[01:40] Then you're like, great, this problem solved.

[01:41] I'm gonna write it down next time.

[01:42] Here we go.

[01:43] I'm gonna write down for you right now.

[01:44] And if you want, I'm gonna memorialize this with an email.

[01:46] And send it to you that way we have a timestamp

[01:48] and everything.

[01:49] But when if you's like, I knew that you wanted me to do it.

[01:52] It's like, oh, then did you not know what I wanted you to do?

[01:57] Because he did said me something.

[01:59] He just sent me the wrong thing.

[02:01] What's the that versus the what?

[02:03] Let me explain.

[02:03] Two things don't always mean the same things.

[02:06] You want to define what you're asking someone to do

[02:08] in terms of behavior or outcomes.

[02:11] So if I wanted that TPS report, right?

[02:13] Now that's a really simple example.

[02:14] I would probably be like, well, when I say like,

[02:17] give me that, I was like, does that mean it's gonna be printed out?

[02:19] Does that mean I want it printed out on my desk?

[02:21] Does that mean it's an email?

[02:22] Does that mean it's gonna be verbally given to me?

[02:24] Is it gonna mean to presentation in what format?

[02:27] And the thing is, is like, you might hear this

[02:28] and be like, oh, that sounds like such a pain.

[02:30] But it's like, it probably takes like two or three

[02:32] extra minutes for you to be like very clear.

[02:35] And then someone's gonna take that two or three extra minutes

[02:37] and then save themselves like two or three extra hours.

[02:40] Clarity is high leverage work.

[02:42] I would say that if this is something

[02:43] that makes you uncomfortable, you need to break that habit

[02:47] for real, let me explain why.

[02:49] How do you think AI works?

[02:51] Why do you think prompt engineering is such a high leverage

[02:54] skill right now?

[02:55] Because the problem is no one even knows how to communicate.

[02:58] Got this thing of ultimate intelligence that can do.

[03:00] Things incredibly quickly is access to the world's information.

[03:03] And yet, you can't get AI to do stuff for you.

[03:05] It's not because AI's dumb.

[03:09] Because you don't wanna talk to AI.

[03:10] And if you can't talk to AI, you can't talk to a human.

[03:12] AI honestly has more context and more tries to waste

[03:15] to figure out what you're trying to say

[03:16] because we communicate like monkeys.

[03:18] We're communicating with other monkeys.

[03:19] We gotta be as crystal clear as humanly possible.

[03:21] Now what's interesting is that the bigger the organization gets,

[03:24] the more this banana phone, it should become a problem.

[03:26] The little five system, the star system,

[03:28] I run through it in my head all the time.

[03:30] Did they not know that?

[03:31] I wanna do it, didn't that know?

[03:32] What I wanna do, what's I defined

[03:34] in terms of behaviors or outcomes?

[03:36] I need this thing on my desk by Monday,

[03:38] printed out with that nice paper.

[03:40] Or, it's I need you to, when someone says this,

[03:44] say this instead next time.

[03:46] Not be less of a dick or stop harassing Courtney.

[03:49] It's like, well, what does harassing Courtney look like?

[03:51] He obviously isn't trying to harass Courtney.

[03:53] She might describe his behaviors harassing.

[03:55] He might describe his behavior as being cordial.

[03:58] So now what happens?

[03:59] Until you actually break down the behavior

[04:01] that they're both labeling differently,

[04:03] he's saying, hey, I said good morning tour,

[04:05] she's saying, hey, he's hitting on me.

[04:07] And you're like, well, what the hell, like, what's going on?

[04:10] But until you figure out, wait, Courtney,

[04:12] when you see he's hitting on you,

[04:13] what exactly did he do?

[04:15] If she's like, we always like smiles at me and waves

[04:17] when he comes in, it's like,

[04:20] I don't think he's hitting on you, Courtney.

[04:21] I think he's being polite.

[04:22] On the flip side, it's like, what do you think

[04:24] hitting on you is?

[04:25] It's like he always squeezes my ass when he walks by.

[04:27] It's like, well, that's a fucking problem.

[04:28] Let's be clear here, Mike.

[04:30] You shouldn't squeeze anybody's ass.

[04:32] Let alone a girl.

[04:33] If we say he's hitting on me or be less creepy,

[04:37] no one wakes up and says, I want to be creepy today.

[04:39] Creepy people act in ways that they don't think it's creepy.

[04:42] And so by telling them to stop be creepy,

[04:43] they don't know what that means.

[04:45] That might be one of the best explanations I've given of this.

[04:48] This is the problem.

[04:49] And this is why so many people behave in ways

[04:51] that they don't want to, not because they don't

[04:52] want to do a good job, but because they don't know

[04:53] what doing a good job looks like,

[04:55] because there hasn't been talked enough.

[04:56] You just got to tell them.

[04:57] Number one, they didn't know that, they wanted to do it.

[04:59] If they did know that, you're like, hey,

[05:01] be nice to Courtney.

[05:02] He grabbed Courtney's ass rather than saying, hello,

[05:04] didn't know what to do.

[05:06] If you did know those two things,

[05:07] well, what's the third thing that could be the issue?

[05:09] They knew that, I wanted the GPS report

[05:11] and they knew exactly what it was.

[05:13] Well, then why didn't it happen?

[05:15] Well, did they know how to do it?

[05:18] I told you to do that, but honestly, you asked me to,

[05:20] but I don't know how to put a GPS report together.

[05:22] And I'm like, wait, you didn't get that in on-boarding?

[05:24] Honestly, no.

[05:25] Oh, okay.

[05:26] The solution to this is training, by the way,

[05:30] if you're like, man, and I think,

[05:31] like, this drives me absolutely insane.

[05:33] I will hear people say, these things aren't trainable.

[05:36] Everything is trainable.

[05:37] How do you think a baby learns how to do anything?

[05:39] How do you think humans learn things to begin with?

[05:40] It's just that some things take longer to train than others,

[05:43] and it's not even that a specific thing takes longer to train.

[05:45] It's just that that term has more skills

[05:48] than underneath of it, that ladder up to the larger thing.

[05:51] Meaning, if I say, be kind, be kind has like,

[05:55] 500 behaviors underneath of it.

[05:57] Yeah, it's harder to train aptitude than attitude,

[05:59] because attitude is 500 behaviors,

[06:02] aptitude might be 20.

[06:04] Yes, it is easier to train this than that,

[06:07] but it's not that something is intrainable.

[06:08] And this is why specificity is so important.

[06:10] If you don't know how to do it, what part do you not know

[06:13] how to do?

[06:14] Do you not know how to turn on a computer?

[06:14] Do you not know how to turn on the internet?

[06:16] Do you not know how to send an email?

[06:17] Do you not know how to use Excel?

[06:18] Do you know how to use all this stuff?

[06:19] Okay, boom, underneath that,

[06:20] do you not know where the data is?

[06:22] Do you need to extract this from?

[06:23] No, I know where the data is.

[06:24] Okay, got it.

[06:25] Then once you have the data,

[06:26] do you not know how to format it?

[06:28] Yeah, I don't know how to format it.

[06:30] Got it.

[06:31] So now instead of being like, oh, this guy's an idiot.

[06:32] It's just like, he knew how to do eight of the nine steps.

[06:34] He just couldn't do the last step.

[06:36] So now I can say, cool, let me show you how to format it.

[06:38] Done.

[06:39] And from here on out, when I asked you for a TPS report,

[06:41] this one I'm looking for.

[06:42] Makes sense?

[06:43] Yes.

[06:43] Now, let me give you a little process.

[06:46] The higher the general skill and competence of the individual,

[06:50] the greater the expertise of the person in the domain,

[06:52] the more vague you can be with your directions.

[06:55] If someone comes to me and says, hey,

[06:57] I've got this product, this new marker,

[06:58] and it writes ups I down, and it's invisible and it's amazing.

[07:01] Alex, can you build a business around this?

[07:03] I could just say yes.

[07:04] Because I have all the other skills

[07:05] that takes to build a business.

[07:07] Now, if you go to somebody who might be less risk-yield,

[07:09] you might have to just say, hey,

[07:11] can you make a marketing campaign around this?

[07:13] Now, that person probably might not be able to like set up

[07:15] the end of the structure in a tax efficient manner,

[07:17] or be able to source the materials,

[07:18] or be able to set up HR practices and all this other stuff.

[07:21] But like, they could do the marketing campaign,

[07:23] and you might be able to go to a good marketer

[07:24] and say, hey, can you run a good marketing campaign?

[07:25] They say, sure.

[07:26] Now, if you go to a junior marketer,

[07:28] you be like, hey, can you run a marketing campaign?

[07:29] They be like, ah, it's like, okay, can you write some emails

[07:32] about this?

[07:33] Right, we just keep chunking it down.

[07:34] The more skilled the person, the vague or the instructions

[07:38] can be, the less skilled the person,

[07:40] the more specific it has to be.

[07:42] For anything around trading,

[07:43] I talk with this length, but basically document,

[07:45] demonstrate duplicate, which means that I write it down.

[07:48] I do it in front of you.

[07:49] You do it in front of me, and then sign on.

[07:52] That's how it works.

[07:53] So we create the list is me doing it.

[07:54] I observe myself or someone observes me doing it,

[07:56] puts the list down.

[07:57] I then do that list in front of the person.

[07:59] They do that list in front of me,

[08:00] and then we have a great day.

[08:01] With the TPS report, I say, hey, here the steps

[08:04] for formatting, I'm going to write them down,

[08:06] and then I'm going to do those steps in front of them,

[08:08] and then I'm saying, hey, let's do a second TPS report

[08:10] for next week.

[08:11] We can do it together.

[08:12] They do it in front of me, following the exact same steps

[08:14] that wrote down.

[08:15] They did it, skill is transferred.

[08:16] And now next time I ask for the TPS report,

[08:18] it'll be on time.

[08:19] If you want more of this trading stuff,

[08:21] it's out of my lead's book.

[08:22] I have a chapter on employees,

[08:23] because you got to get them to do stuff for you.

[08:26] And inside, I have my very, very sexy,

[08:28] besides how to attract employees, methodology for,

[08:32] on page 207, which I say how to get employees to get you leads,

[08:35] but it's really how to get employees to do anything.

[08:37] So it's step one document, you make a checklist,

[08:39] step two, you demonstrate you doing front of them.

[08:41] Step three, they do locate, they do it in front of you.

[08:43] So I have this in more details on page 207 and 208

[08:46] in the lead's book, enjoy that.

[08:47] Slide recap, first we figure out if they knew even

[08:50] that we wanted them to do it.

[08:51] Second, we made sure that they knew what we wanted them to do.

[08:53] And the third, it's like, okay, if they know those two,

[08:55] then do they not even know how to do it.

[08:57] Now if they do, then did they know,

[09:00] and this is a big point which happens all the time,

[09:02] is did they know when I wanted it done by?

[09:06] And this sounds so silly, but the reality is

[09:09] that the solution for this is deadlines,

[09:13] but it's not just deadlines, I'm gonna give you

[09:15] a little 201 version of this.

[09:16] If I say, hey Kyle, one can you get me the TPS reports

[09:19] by?

[09:20] He might say Monday.

[09:21] Now a boss or leader or whatever who doesn't pay as much

[09:25] attention much as, say, sure, that sounds good.

[09:28] I like to push on this and I say, cool, how long do you

[09:31] think it will take you in order to get the TPS report done?

[09:35] The actual work itself, not from now until you can deliver it,

[09:38] but how long will the work take?

[09:39] And usually someone will say something like,

[09:41] I don't know, probably like two hours, I'm like,

[09:42] okay, well, it's Wednesday and it's two o'clock.

[09:45] What are you doing between now and four o'clock?

[09:47] Now if they have something that's more important,

[09:49] then they can be like, well, I was after finished

[09:51] this thing by tomorrow and then I've got this

[09:53] other thing that I'm gonna do, and then that should take

[09:55] a full day and then after that, I've got this thing,

[09:57] and then after that, I was playing out

[09:59] and working on it over the weekend,

[10:00] so I could get it to my Monday.

[10:01] That I'd be like, okay, that makes sense.

[10:03] Now if I look at all those other things,

[10:04] I might find out a couple of things.

[10:06] Number one is maybe they don't have all these other things,

[10:09] in which case do this now.

[10:10] And maybe they do have all these other things,

[10:12] but this thing is more important, in which case do it now,

[10:15] by consistently asking when they can do it,

[10:17] how long it will take and then what else they have going on,

[10:20] allows you to have a way better idea

[10:23] of everyone else's workload in real time,

[10:25] whatever asking people, and also it just makes you way

[10:28] better boss of my opinion, because if people are like,

[10:30] oh, I've got these, you're like, oh no, finish that.

[10:32] That's more important.

[10:32] Do that first after this, we'll do my thing.

[10:34] Well, this is kind of, I would say a pervasive mindset

[10:37] that I have, but basically end of day is better

[10:42] than end of week.

[10:44] I want end of day to be my default.

[10:46] I want everyone's default in my life to be end of day.

[10:49] Think about how impactful this is.

[10:52] If you just assume whatever you ask for anything,

[10:54] that it should be done by end of day,

[10:56] your organizational move at seven times the speed.

[10:59] Some organizations like their default is end of month,

[11:02] end of week.

[11:03] And end of month, the organization will literally work

[11:05] at one 30th of the pace of an end of day organization.

[11:08] And you might think, oh my God, that's crazy.

[11:10] But do you think that some companies

[11:12] grow 30 times faster than others?

[11:14] Hell yeah, there are.

[11:15] And this is why the rich care richer

[11:17] and the poor get poor.

[11:18] And there's the great divide between the doers

[11:20] and the everyone else.

[11:22] It's because you really can't outwork

[11:24] someone a thousand times.

[11:25] You really can't.

[11:26] I can't put out a thousand times for constantly new.

[11:28] I really can't.

[11:29] I can't do that.

[11:29] We can't work a thousand times faster than you.

[11:31] If it takes you 90 days to get something done,

[11:33] and we get it done in two hours,

[11:34] we work two thousand times faster than you.

[11:36] It's crazy.

[11:36] Then it shouldn't be as big of a surprise

[11:38] that some people outre and other people

[11:39] by thousand times.

[11:40] We're saying this can't turn a trace for this to you

[11:42] so that you can go get a rich and do whatever you want.

[11:44] Because I'm a die and no one's gonna go

[11:45] for any ways long term.

[11:46] The mind is we'll do something useful.

[11:48] And what's interesting about the star system

[11:50] and that it actually creates stars.

[11:52] Because if you tell somebody,

[11:55] because you wrote it down, they know that they should do it.

[11:58] They understand the what that must be done accurately.

[12:02] They understand how to do the thing

[12:04] because you've done it with them before.

[12:05] They know how to do it your way

[12:07] and you've taught them, you've broken it down.

[12:09] And then they'll be able to do it faster

[12:11] because they've absolutely clarity on this point.

[12:13] And this is what starts to really move an organization.

[12:16] And so the other pro tip is that Jeff Baso

[12:18] says an amazing one-pager that I tweeted about,

[12:21] not that long ago.

[12:22] And it was almost like the theme of the month for me.

[12:25] But he basically takes an excerpt from Richard Dawkins

[12:28] talking about biology that basically biology fights

[12:31] against this environment to stand out.

[12:33] On a long-term horizon, once something dies,

[12:35] it basically merges with this environment.

[12:37] Like it becomes inseparable.

[12:38] On a long-term horizon, like you just become dirt.

[12:40] Like literally you become the same thing.

[12:43] And the thing is is that it takes energy,

[12:44] a tremendous amount of energy to stand out to be different.

[12:47] The world will try to pull you down,

[12:49] it will pull you into mediocrity.

[12:50] And the same thing happens within companies.

[12:52] Like the trend line is regression towards the mean.

[12:55] That exists for a reason.

[12:57] You have to basically be willing to be so potent

[13:00] as a person that a drop of you into an ocean of clear water

[13:04] turns the entire clear water the same color as you.

[13:06] And fundamentally, that is what decimiting culture

[13:09] is from a leadership perspective.

[13:11] Like that is how great organizations are built.

[13:13] You have to hold the line.

[13:15] That means that this always happens.

[13:17] That means that every time I'm on a meeting

[13:19] and for driving something, the key word is that we're driving it.

[13:22] Like I was actually talking to one of my leaders

[13:23] in the company, early today, and last week about this.

[13:25] And I was like, I want you to replace the word leader

[13:28] and I want you to switch it with driver in your mind.

[13:30] I was like, because that's what I need.

[13:31] I need people who drive.

[13:33] Like you're a slave driver.

[13:35] The point is that you're driving things to get done.

[13:37] It's like, hey, where is that?

[13:39] How can we do it faster?

[13:40] What else can I pull off your plate?

[13:42] Which I'm already giving you a little bit of pre-framing

[13:45] for the fifth and maybe the most important part of the star,

[13:48] which is if someone knows that, they need to do it.

[13:51] They know what they're supposed to do.

[13:53] They know how to do it.

[13:54] They know what it's do by, what's the last thing

[13:56] that could stop them.

[13:57] And I'm going to take motivation out of this

[13:59] and I'll tell you why.

[14:00] But the last thing that could stop them,

[14:04] is circumstances.

[14:06] Now, what does that mean?

[14:08] It means something else.

[14:09] So if I asked you do all that stuff

[14:10] but you're like, but do you ask me to do 10 other things?

[14:13] So something else got in the way

[14:15] in obstacle.

[14:16] Something is blocking them.

[14:17] Speaking of obstacles, wouldn't it be amazing to know

[14:21] what obstacles are going to arise

[14:23] and by having a map, a magical map dare I say,

[14:27] that could show you where all these obstacles

[14:29] will come up in the road?

[14:30] Well, I think we'd all want that.

[14:32] And I can't promise you that.

[14:33] But what I can do is tell you that we spent 200 plus hours

[14:35] actually analyzing all the companies

[14:37] who are portfolio and basically breaking down

[14:39] the stages of growth and the 10 stages by function.

[14:42] What is advertising look like at five person

[14:45] ahead count versus 50 percent count?

[14:47] What is customer success look like?

[14:48] Or customer service look like

[14:50] when you're at your $1 million year,

[14:51] versus $10 million year.

[14:52] What is sales or sales team look like

[14:54] when you're at 100 employees versus five employees?

[14:57] Right, or even one employee?

[14:58] What does it look like?

[14:59] And so we broke down this entire process.

[15:01] It's absolutely free.

[15:02] You just put in your information.

[15:03] You'll tell you what stage you're at,

[15:05] what you're most likely to be struggling with

[15:06] and what you can do to get through it.

[15:08] Acres of no conference, I should have had.

[15:09] And if you want us to do this with you in person,

[15:12] and it actually be like, okay, not only this is the problem

[15:15] but like these are the solutions that work really, really well.

[15:17] On the Think page book, a call,

[15:19] our team would love to talk to you.

[15:20] If it's a fit for you guys to come out,

[15:22] we'd love to have you out here in Vegas.

[15:23] We run these workshops monthly.

[15:25] And it's a lot of fun.

[15:26] People really like it.

[15:27] And more importantly, I think business owners

[15:28] get a huge amount of value from it.

[15:30] So, I love to meet you and back to the video.

[15:33] If I ask the best chef in the world,

[15:35] hey, can you make me an omelette?

[15:36] What an omelette is, you know, how to make it?

[15:38] And I want you to make it for me right now.

[15:40] That guy might not do it.

[15:41] I'd be like, why didn't you make me an omelette?

[15:42] He might be like, I don't have any eggs.

[15:47] We want me to do it.

[15:48] I don't have any eggs.

[15:48] And to the same degree, in a real business setting,

[15:50] you might be like, I don't have the ram on my laptop

[15:52] to be able to process this size file

[15:54] and edit this thing on time.

[15:56] I have to get this other thing or I have to move

[15:57] to this other place and that's gonna take me time.

[15:59] Like, there's some things that sometimes block people.

[16:01] Now, the reason this is so important.

[16:03] And this is the one I'll tell you right now.

[16:05] We go through the other four first

[16:06] because as soon as you mention this fifth one,

[16:08] everyone blames this one.

[16:09] Good, why?

[16:10] Because then it's not that.

[16:11] People's egos are protected when they say,

[16:12] oh, I've got this other thing.

[16:13] I got this other work.

[16:14] I got this, I don't have eggs.

[16:16] I don't have a Wi-Fi.

[16:17] I don't have a blah, blah, blah.

[16:19] Now, this is where the real leadership start comes in.

[16:23] Because this is where we say, like,

[16:25] well, how hard would it have been for you to go get eggs?

[16:29] It's been three days.

[16:30] Like, how hard was it to get eggs?

[16:34] Well, the Wi-Fi was slow.

[16:37] Was there any way to get faster Wi-Fi?

[16:40] This is where I start to make judgments

[16:42] on someone's agency.

[16:44] Their ability to solve problems on their own.

[16:47] Because the thing that we always want to tease out long-term

[16:52] is this.

[16:54] Why?

[16:55] Because that's the big motivation question.

[16:57] Because you'd assume, why didn't someone do it?

[16:59] Because they weren't motivated.

[17:00] Me asking someone, hey, were you not motivated

[17:03] to do this?

[17:03] No one's gonna say this.

[17:04] I'm just being real.

[17:05] It's not gonna happen.

[17:06] And so we ask these other questions.

[17:08] The first four are what I would consider

[17:10] very standard business practices.

[17:13] But the hears the thing that's really clever with this,

[17:15] is that by asking the first four,

[17:17] you basically give many opportunities

[17:19] for it to not be attacked on the person.

[17:22] When you have the circumstances one,

[17:23] it also has realistic options

[17:26] where it might not be the person's fault.

[17:27] You might actually have too much stuff on their plate.

[17:29] But this is where the nuance comes in.

[17:31] Where you get to judge, are those circumstances

[17:35] really the things that block you?

[17:37] Or are you actually not trying?

[17:38] Now, with the, hey, I just need an omelette

[17:40] by next Monday on my desk.

[17:43] And the person gets to you next Monday

[17:44] and says, I didn't have any eggs.

[17:48] When we talk about here, I mean,

[17:50] you're technically correct.

[17:51] If you have no eggs, you can't make an omelette.

[17:53] But do you lack the other skills of acquiring eggs?

[17:56] If you do, then we ask the larger question is,

[18:00] I know I could train you on how to get eggs.

[18:02] But is it worth the hassle?

[18:04] I got to train you on how to use computer.

[18:06] But is it worth the time?

[18:08] This is why this is my fundamental belief

[18:10] about training in general, which is that everything is

[18:12] tradable.

[18:13] It's just not everything's worth training.

[18:14] Some things you expect to have someone

[18:16] have batteries included.

[18:17] And that's why there are requisites for jobs.

[18:18] That's why when you go to school,

[18:20] you have to take English 101 before you take English 201.

[18:22] You get my point.

[18:23] The reason this is such a powerful frame.

[18:25] If someone comes back and says something like,

[18:27] well, I didn't think that was my job.

[18:29] Well, then they probably shouldn't do anything else

[18:31] in your company either,

[18:32] because fundamentally, like, what creates motivation?

[18:35] Motivation is the opposite deprivation.

[18:38] But somebody who motivates other people

[18:41] is able to temporarily increase the value of an outcome.

[18:47] Fundamentally, that's the motivation is.

[18:49] And if you think about that, that's also a persuasion is.

[18:51] That's also what sales is.

[18:52] And so there's a lot of words that fundamentally mean

[18:53] the same thing.

[18:54] If I motivate you to buy, that's what a salesman does.

[18:56] If I motivate you to move, I motivate you to change your behavior.

[18:59] I, for a short period of time,

[19:01] change the relative value of an outcome,

[19:02] which then changes your behavior.

[19:04] So if I talk to you and talk about your weight,

[19:06] and you haven't done anything about losing weight

[19:07] in a very long time,

[19:08] but in a short period of time, I change the relative value

[19:10] to you about what it might be like to lose weight,

[19:13] or, said differently, the pain associated with losing weight.

[19:16] You might have always wanted to lose weight,

[19:17] but it didn't realize it could be easier, right?

[19:19] Or, you might realize it's hard,

[19:21] but I really, I explain even more value.

[19:24] Like, hey, I don't know if you knew this,

[19:25] but you'll live 10 years longer, statistically,

[19:28] if you lose 50 pounds, then on the sudden,

[19:30] you say your daughter's not to get married,

[19:31] don't you want to see your kids, right?

[19:33] So my mother, sign up,

[19:35] don't leave reason she lost weight,

[19:36] was because the doctor told her

[19:38] that she wasn't gonna see my grandkids,

[19:40] and that was the thing,

[19:41] try to lose weight or whole life,

[19:43] 30, 15 years, try to lose weight, good and do it.

[19:45] That was the line.

[19:46] He was able to motivate her, because that was the one thing for her.

[19:49] And so sometimes we have to dig door ourselves, okay,

[19:50] what other things are we playing with

[19:52] that we can change the relative value

[19:54] of either decreasing the pain or decreasing the stick,

[19:56] or increasing the care to associate with getting the stick?

[19:58] But it still helps us tease out what's really going on.

[20:02] Fundamentally, we're just finding out the things

[20:04] that drive the person and trying to align

[20:06] them doing the thing with them getting what they want.

[20:08] Sometimes a salesperson will get tired of selling,

[20:12] because it's the same conversation over and over again.

[20:14] They all say they'll get bored,

[20:15] but there's a huge amount of time

[20:17] between the first time you get bored and sales,

[20:19] and when you're exceptional in sales.

[20:20] Explaining that in and of itself to a salesperson's that

[20:23] your ability to maintain focus is itself a skill

[20:27] that needs to be developed in order for you

[20:29] to become world-class, which is what you said you wanted.

[20:32] Sometimes just reframing their current struggle,

[20:36] as a skill deficiency on their way to getting what they ultimately want,

[20:40] is one of the most motivating things that you can do.

[20:43] To help someone do the thing that they ultimately

[20:46] probably want to do too, they just haven't been motivated too.

[20:49] We knock out all of the peripheral things.

[20:50] They didn't know what they wanted.

[20:52] They didn't know what it was.

[20:53] They didn't know how to do it.

[20:54] They didn't know when we want to do it.

[20:55] They had something in the block, but not really.

[20:57] And so the main one is that we can get to the motivation.

[21:00] But if some people just fundamentally

[21:02] don't have an motivation on this thing,

[21:03] sometimes they just don't need to work for you.

[21:04] And that's okay.

[21:05] There's tons of other companies that will employ mediocre people.

[21:09] It just doesn't have to be yours.

[21:10] If I give you a fun one, because some of you guys have employed people

[21:13] that you know shouldn't be working for you.

[21:15] It's your sister, it's your sister's husband,

[21:17] it's your cousin, and you think yourself,

[21:20] man, if I finally let them go, no one's going to hire them.

[21:23] It's like, yeah, no one would hire them.

[21:26] And somehow you think it's a good idea

[21:28] that you continue to employ them.

[21:30] That feels max silly, silly, silly game.

[21:33] Silly to your S tier, S tier silly.

[21:35] You're entering your silly arc.

[21:37] You're silly, era.

[21:38] Now, let me give you a little bonus reframe on this.

[21:40] If you're trying to look at your business as a business owner,

[21:42] right, from a strategic perspective,

[21:44] there's a lot of things that you could do.

[21:47] But we have to ask ourselves, what are the things

[21:50] that are the most important for us to do?

[21:53] By when would it be the most meaningful?

[21:55] Now, here's where it gets really interesting.

[21:57] You more often than not are gonna have how issues.

[22:00] You're not gonna know how to do it.

[22:02] And reframing the things that you know you need to do

[22:07] as questions that you don't know the answer to

[22:10] is so much more valuable than there's no to consult like me.

[22:17] I don't know how to get someone to consult like me.

[22:20] No one can market like I can.

[22:21] I don't know how to find somebody to can market like I can.

[22:24] That's solvable.

[22:26] No one can is a statement that you can do anything with.

[22:28] What I would really, really push back on as my kind of like

[22:32] leaving thought that might be the most powerful thing

[22:33] in this video.

[22:34] Be incredibly wary about the statements that you make

[22:37] that you believe are facts,

[22:39] because those statements exist as truth only in your mind.

[22:45] Basically, your reality will be influenced

[22:47] by the laws that you choose to create and live by.

[22:50] If you want to bend your own reality,

[22:52] you have to be able to change the laws that exist

[22:56] in the matrix.

[22:58] It's like every system is built on rules.

[23:00] Some rules you can bend, others you can break.

[23:02] Wouldn't you want to build a business in a world

[23:05] that had the few rules possible?

[23:07] And then what's interesting to me

[23:08] is that the amount of conversations that I have with business owners

[23:11] who tell me rules that limit their business like,

[23:14] oh, we can't charge more than that.

[23:16] Why?

[23:19] Because no one else does.

[23:20] That sounds like a terrible reason.

[23:23] We can't pay people that much.

[23:25] Why?

[23:27] Because it's not industry standard.

[23:30] Okay.

[23:31] Well, everybody in your industry makes no money

[23:32] so why would we do what they're doing?

[23:34] The biggest gift that I can give you

[23:36] is that the vast majority of business owners are broke,

[23:39] vast majority.

[23:40] The average business owner makes like 50,000 dollars a year.

[23:43] I'm not saying this broke, it would be clear.

[23:44] But for many people, the aspirations

[23:46] of being a business owner come with significantly higher goals

[23:49] than that reality.

[23:49] And if that's true, then the vast majority of business owners

[23:52] are wildly underperforming their aspirations.

[23:55] And a big part of that is because they model people like them.

[24:01] Most business owners look around.

[24:03] They see whatever everyone else is doing.

[24:04] They say, oh, I'll do that.

[24:05] And I'll do it a little bit better for a little bit less.

[24:08] But then every other person does that too.

[24:09] Until eventually you can't do anymore for any less.

[24:12] Many of these businesses function as essentially

[24:14] non-profit organizations, where the person's barely above water

[24:18] selling a largely commoditized service

[24:21] at a commoditized price with no differentiation

[24:23] in the marketplace whatsoever.

[24:25] That's a game where if you choose to play like everyone else,

[24:27] you will lose.

[24:28] If everyone's doing something, it's a great reason not to do it.

[24:31] If anything, that alone would be,

[24:33] that would be a reason not to do it.

[24:35] At least it's different.

[24:36] At least you have an angle.

[24:37] You have something that's different.

[24:38] Well, if everyone else is paying this,

[24:39] maybe if I pay more, I'll be able to suck up the top 10%.

[24:42] One of the things that people don't talk about, Henry Ford,

[24:44] is Henry Ford paid people better than his competitors.

[24:47] So that he could scoop up the entirety of the talent

[24:50] at his plans.

[24:51] He's the one who invented the manufacturing line.

[24:54] He's like, yeah, he did.

[24:55] He also paid people better than anyone else,

[24:57] so they could get the top talent.

[24:58] People thought of him as the guy who was just automating humans out.

[25:01] It's like, nah, he just actually ended up paying

[25:02] the best people to work for him.

[25:03] But he did something that people weren't.

[25:04] I would walk through this star system

[25:06] so that you can also think about your own business

[25:08] in that same frame.

[25:09] Why aren't you doing what you know you need to be doing?

[25:11] Do you not know that out at least it be done?

[25:13] Do you don't know what it is?

[25:14] Do you don't know how to do it?

[25:15] You don't know when it would be meaningful

[25:16] that it's been done by or do you have something

[25:18] that is blocking you?

[25:20] And you have something that's blocking you?

[25:21] Is it more important than that thing?

[25:23] And if the answer is no, then stop doing it

[25:25] and do the thing instead.

[25:26] And if you were struggling to be motivated,

[25:28] maybe you need to look at yourself in the mirror

[25:30] and I don't know what you'd say yourself in the mirror,

[25:31] but you could look at yourself

[25:32] and eventually actually just do it

[25:34] because the look of yourself in the mirror

[25:35] is not gonna change anything anyways.

[25:36] But, you know, maybe you look good,

[25:38] maybe that'll get your motivated.

[25:40] Use the star system next time for a hard conversation.

[25:42] Hey, real quick, did you not know that?

[25:45] I wanted you to do it?

[25:46] Did you not know what I wanted you to do?

[25:47] Did you not know how to do it?

[25:48] Did you just do it by Tuesday or was there something blocking you?

[25:51] There was something blocking you.

[25:52] Is it reasonable that it blocked you for that long?

[25:54] No, okay, what's the issue?

[25:56] Or, you know what?

[25:57] You're right, that did block you, do that first,

[25:59] and then do this after.

[26:00] So I wanna read you a real exchange I had with an employee

[26:03] that wasn't performing the way I wanted him to.

[26:06] I said, hey, what are you doing today?

[26:09] And then he gave me his little rundown.

[26:10] And I said, I asked because I have a fault

[26:13] like I've seen a lot of production from you,

[26:16] compared to what I think you're capable of.

[26:19] So I'm curious whether it's not knowing what to do,

[26:21] that I want you to do it, how to do it,

[26:23] or that's something's preventing you,

[26:25] or if you're not motivated to do the above.

[26:31] And by frame with that way,

[26:34] it completely shifts the whole vibe of the conversation.

[26:37] And by adding the piece,

[26:40] and I think this is really key

[26:41] in terms of how it was framed,

[26:42] this is like compared to what I believe you're capable of.

[26:45] So I basically weaving in a compliment saying,

[26:48] I think you're capable of more,

[26:49] I think your potential is significantly higher.

[26:51] Rather than saying, hey, you suck.

[26:53] I'm actually saying, hey, I think you're awesome,

[26:54] and I think you're performance,

[26:56] which is separate from you as you human being,

[26:58] is below what I believe you're capable of.

[27:01] So what do we think the gap is?

[27:02] Is that, you know, that, how, what, when,

[27:05] or something's blocking you, or you're not motivated,

[27:08] help me help you.

[27:10] And from this perspective,

[27:11] both of you are basically attacking the problem

[27:14] on the same side of the table,

[27:16] trying to figure out how to get the person

[27:17] to their potential, which both of you were aligned to have happened.

[27:20] And I'm telling you, it's just,

[27:22] like imagine if I started that being able to like,

[27:23] hey, man, you're subpar right now,

[27:25] you're under expectations.

[27:27] Like, that sounds pretty bad.

[27:29] Everyone's gonna be defensive,

[27:30] they're gonna be thinking it's attacking their character,

[27:32] when it couldn't be further from the truth.

[27:34] And so having little frameworks like this,

[27:36] I've just like made life so much easier

[27:37] for getting people back to where you want to be.

[27:40] With that, I'll leave it there,

[27:41] I'll see you in the next fit.

[00:00] I want to talk about a business myth that needs to die.

[00:02] It's something that's so many business owners believe.

[00:05] Zemin is playing what it is,

[00:07] how it's applied to thousands of businesses

[00:09] that have come to our headquarters here at Acres.com in Vegas.

[00:12] And how it's likely holding you back.

[00:15] And it's one of the most insidious beliefs.

[00:16] And I think it might be the one that ends the most businesses

[00:20] and the crazy part is has nothing to do with the business

[00:22] and everything to do about how you treat it.

[00:24] Now, I've had the same problem come up again

[00:27] and again and again that I felt the need to make this for you.

[00:31] Which is, my business isn't scalable

[00:34] or shouldn't I switch my business something that's more scalable?

[00:37] Again, I might gouge my own eyes out.

[00:40] But the reason that I so annoyed by it is that basically,

[00:44] every business has limits to scalability.

[00:47] And there are different problems that occur at different times.

[00:50] Now, I want to talk about this within two different contexts.

[00:53] One is industry context and seconder

[00:55] is more on the demand and supply side.

[00:58] But I'm going to break this down a lot of ways.

[01:00] So right off the bat, if you have a service business, for example,

[01:03] you hire humans to do things for other humans,

[01:06] then that as a business that's very easy to start,

[01:08] can be very profitable.

[01:10] And then over time can become a little bit more difficult,

[01:12] not impossible, just more difficult to scale quickly

[01:16] because maintaining quality of service

[01:18] when you have other humans doing things

[01:19] and you're bringing them in

[01:20] and they don't know anything and you have to train them

[01:21] become more challenging.

[01:22] If we had to kind of like the middle of the path there,

[01:24] we've got like any commerce business,

[01:26] which you can start relatively quickly.

[01:27] But as you scale up, you can scale up quickly,

[01:30] but some of the issues become supply chain

[01:32] and logistical problems.

[01:33] So I'd say that's kind of like in the middle.

[01:35] It's a little bit slower to start,

[01:37] a cost a little bit more money to start.

[01:38] It does scale faster than traditional service does,

[01:41] but you're still going to run into some problems.

[01:42] Now, all the way on the extreme side,

[01:44] you've got the software digital type businesses.

[01:47] Now, these businesses are typically,

[01:49] when I say digital, I mean, SaaS, software,

[01:51] not digital products like e-books and courses,

[01:55] things like that.

[01:55] These businesses cost the most amount of time to start,

[01:58] the most amount of money to start,

[01:59] but once you achieve scale,

[02:01] they become significantly easier, relative to the others.

[02:04] And so I get this question of like,

[02:06] I don't think my business is that scalable the time

[02:08] when in reality it's just harder to scale.

[02:10] And so the thing is that switching from one service

[02:13] business to another service is in terms of overall category

[02:16] is not likely to dramatically change your growth trajectory at all.

[02:19] You're still likely going to be constrained by humans,

[02:21] which most businesses are.

[02:23] I'm going to say this again,

[02:24] 78% of businesses in the United States

[02:26] are service-based businesses.

[02:28] Like, this is reality.

[02:30] And the reason that this is so annoying to me

[02:32] is that people will come and want to break their businesses,

[02:34] they won't want to abandon their businesses,

[02:37] because they think that the woman in the red dress,

[02:38] they think that this other new thing somehow

[02:40] doesn't have the same characteristics of a people-based

[02:43] business.

[02:44] Now, within that category, let's say we have a service business.

[02:46] You can have demand-controlled service businesses.

[02:48] This is a buy-constrained service business.

[02:50] Each business has problems.

[02:52] And the crazy part is, is that the problems are actually

[02:55] kind of similar.

[02:56] So let me explain.

[02:57] So if you have a demand-constrained service business,

[03:00] so you have a brick-and-mortar fitness business,

[03:03] you're going to be demand-constrained.

[03:04] As in, it's going to be harder to find people

[03:06] when it'll work out than it is to find people

[03:07] who want to teach people to work out.

[03:09] Finding trainers and fitness enthusiasts,

[03:10] not that hard, finding people who actually want to come

[03:13] in the gym and get excited and sign up for a service package

[03:16] or something like that, much more difficult.

[03:18] On the flip side, if you have an accounting firm,

[03:21] getting people to do their accounting,

[03:24] everyone has to do their accounting,

[03:26] but getting competent in high quality accounts

[03:28] becomes the issue.

[03:30] Now, how do you solve each of those problems?

[03:32] You promote, fundamentally.

[03:33] You promote to get new customers.

[03:36] You promote to get new accounts.

[03:37] It's the same problem.

[03:39] You just have it on the back end of the business

[03:41] or the front end of the business.

[03:42] And some businesses have alternate between whether supply

[03:45] or demand-constrained if you kind of growth the same rate.

[03:48] So you alternate back and forth.

[03:49] But fundamentally, and this is why I think this is so important,

[03:52] you're going to struggle in one way or the other.

[03:55] And the way that you solve it in either of the situations

[03:58] is going to be through promotion of some sort.

[04:00] And so the reason that I bring this up is that

[04:02] said differently, my business isn't scalable means it's hard.

[04:07] And I want it to be easy.

[04:08] And can you just tell me that it's going to be easy?

[04:10] And it's not.

[04:11] And so difficulty is a feature, not a bug of scaling a business.

[04:16] It is something that comes with scaling a business.

[04:18] And the reason I think this is so important is that there

[04:21] are periods of time.

[04:22] And sometimes this periods are not weeks,

[04:24] but they are quarters.

[04:25] Many quarters in a row.

[04:26] We have to sit with a problem.

[04:28] As in, you see the fire.

[04:30] And it's in your living room.

[04:31] And you have to just let it burn.

[04:32] So let me explain why I mean by this.

[04:34] There will be problems that occur in the business.

[04:36] Let's say that you're your supply constraint.

[04:38] And you need to bring me people in.

[04:40] So once you decide, OK, I can't handle more customers

[04:43] because I have to hire more accounts.

[04:44] I have to hire more HVAC people.

[04:46] I have to hire more technicians at my auto shop, whatever it is.

[04:48] As soon as you make that decision, you see that clearly.

[04:50] You start the promotional cycle.

[04:52] So you start kicking off ads.

[04:53] You start doing some outreach.

[04:54] You start hitting up your network.

[04:56] And then you start some interview.

[04:57] Start some screening.

[04:58] And then maybe you find one or two people.

[05:01] And then you interview them.

[05:02] And then maybe you give them a job offer.

[05:04] And then once you give them a job offer,

[05:06] you have to get them trained up and be proficient.

[05:08] And you might lose some of them,

[05:09] because they're not as good as you thought they were.

[05:11] It other ones are good, but still takes three or six

[05:13] months for them to scale up.

[05:14] And so all of a sudden, remember this with the feelings

[05:17] going to be like, you decided and you realized

[05:19] that you were supply constraint.

[05:20] You went out and you did something about it.

[05:22] Good for you.

[05:22] But once you start going on and doing something about it,

[05:25] what happens?

[05:25] Nothing.

[05:26] The business is still constraint.

[05:27] And so you just suffer.

[05:29] Day in and day out while you try and solve this problem.

[05:32] And here's the nasty part.

[05:33] Let's say that six months from now.

[05:35] But remember, six months is 180 days of everyday you wake up

[05:38] and you're like, I have this problem.

[05:40] I should do something about it.

[05:41] And then you have to remind yourself,

[05:43] I am doing something about it.

[05:44] But the thing is is that your team is still going to be struggling.

[05:47] They're still going to be complaining.

[05:48] You might still be complaining.

[05:49] And the thing is is your brain, your monkey brain,

[05:52] is going to be like, we should do something about this.

[05:54] But you are doing something about it.

[05:56] It's just that the thing you're doing about it

[05:57] isn't going to solve it today.

[05:58] And the likelihood is that, and this is where it gets nasty.

[06:01] This is where the real problem's happened.

[06:03] This is why this is such an important video.

[06:05] During that waiting period is when the vast majority

[06:07] of entrepreneurs fuck with shit.

[06:09] So they change their model, they change their price,

[06:11] they train, they try and change their like, you know,

[06:13] what if we change our deliverable to, you know,

[06:16] it's 20 people per account instead of 10 or 5.

[06:19] And that way, we can keep selling.

[06:21] But then all of a sudden, your service delivery drops.

[06:23] And your turn goes up.

[06:24] And now you have a structural issue within the business.

[06:26] Whereas when you had to business that you had before this,

[06:28] without changing it, you had good margins and good revenue retention,

[06:31] meaning like you can't make him money and people can pay good.

[06:34] And so you take something that's really good.

[06:36] And because you have a constraint on the system,

[06:38] you break the business.

[06:39] While you're waiting for your solution,

[06:41] that you already started on to kick in.

[06:44] And so this is like, this is the tangible of pain tolerance.

[06:48] So a lot of people like to think about like the Rocky Cutscene

[06:51] and things like that, like, oh, I'm a business.

[06:52] It's the grind.

[06:53] The grind is oftentimes realizing those are problem,

[06:57] beginning to try and solve it.

[06:59] And then having to live with that problem

[07:01] for not weeks or months, but quarters and sometimes years.

[07:04] Hey guys, real quick,

[07:05] if you're not sure if you actually have a slow, soft problem

[07:09] or a fast, soft problem, like it's like, man,

[07:11] I just don't know how to solve this.

[07:12] We solve problems in businesses, you know,

[07:15] every day at acquisition.com.

[07:16] And my team looks at companies every single month.

[07:19] And if you'd like to have us take a look at the business,

[07:21] see where the constraint might be and maybe have to help,

[07:25] then you can click somewhere around this video

[07:27] and you can schedule the time to see if it's a good fit

[07:30] for you to come out because this is kind of what we do every day.

[07:32] And so if you're not pretty good at it.

[07:33] And like I said, that's valuable.

[07:35] Click the call if not, enjoy the rest of the video.

[07:37] And so the reason that bringing the stuff is that then

[07:39] the next thing that you start thinking is,

[07:41] well, you know what, maybe I'll have,

[07:43] I'll outsource this, this problem to somebody else.

[07:45] I'm gonna double get this away.

[07:46] Sam Albin had this really good bit that I saw on Instagram

[07:48] the other day and he said,

[07:50] he's the founder of OpenAI, if you don't know his.

[07:51] He says, he can't delegate the execution

[07:54] because the idea and even the product or service

[07:57] oftentimes, though exciting is not the hard part.

[08:00] That's like the 10% of the business.

[08:02] I mean, it's fun.

[08:03] You have lots of iterations, lots of changing.

[08:05] But then once you have it and people are buying it

[08:07] and they like it and you make money at the end of the month,

[08:10] the 90% of everything else is the actual execution.

[08:12] It's the doingness.

[08:14] And the doingness is the part where you have

[08:16] unrelenting problems that either you are actively solving

[08:19] and have not seen the fruits of your labor

[08:22] or you're just solving the micro problems that happen every day.

[08:24] And all the while you have to resist the urge

[08:27] to break the thing that actually works

[08:29] that you spent all of this other time getting all these

[08:31] iterations, getting punched in the face,

[08:32] to find the thing that actually work.

[08:34] And the likelihood that when you change the thing that

[08:36] actually works to something that's not that thing

[08:37] and that other thing is going to work better than the first thing

[08:40] is low.

[08:40] And that's the crazy part.

[08:41] Think about this from a hypothetical perspective.

[08:43] If I have a building, right?

[08:44] I've got bricks all along each of the walls to create the building.

[08:47] There are unlimited places that those bricks

[08:50] could be in the physical world.

[08:51] They could be in China.

[08:52] You know, like I'm saying, like if I had a thousand bricks,

[08:55] brick number 999 could be in its exact place where it needs

[08:58] to be for the building or it could be an unlimited other places.

[09:02] But only in one of those locations

[09:04] is it serving the purpose of keeping the building upright.

[09:06] And so oftentimes when we move bricks, what we're doing is

[09:09] the likelihood that the move that we have is going to take

[09:11] that brick from something that already works in the building

[09:13] to improving the strength of the building,

[09:15] versus just being a jungle block that we remove,

[09:17] where we put on the side, or we just put it across the street.

[09:19] And then we think that it's going to improve the building.

[09:21] When in fact, the likelihood that when we change

[09:23] something that works that it works better is usually significantly lower.

[09:26] And so I want to, I want to, I want to dovetail

[09:27] into kind of a third bigger idea here, which is features and books.

[09:30] I referenced a little bit earlier, but I want to hit on it

[09:32] really hard. And to use the words of my great CFO Suzanne,

[09:36] she said, all businesses have shit.

[09:37] All businesses have features and books.

[09:40] But I think one of the big mistakes is that founders believe that the

[09:43] feature is a bug when it really isn't.

[09:45] And so if you have, let's say a service business, then you're

[09:49] going to be like, man, it's hard to find good people.

[09:51] I should change my business model.

[09:52] Well, people's the business.

[09:53] That's a feature.

[09:54] That's something that comes standard with the business.

[09:57] You're never going to eliminate it.

[09:58] It's going to be part of it.

[09:59] If you were like, man, I am a software company.

[10:03] Then guess what the problem that you're going to have is.

[10:04] Finding good software developer, they're really hard to find.

[10:07] And they're really expensive.

[10:08] And so you were willing to still have to manage those people.

[10:11] Now, of course, there are problems in business that you can solve.

[10:14] It's just that there's a lot of businesses that you

[10:16] manage rather than solve.

[10:17] You don't, you never get through them.

[10:19] It's just like basically this pain of business that just,

[10:23] it's just overhead.

[10:24] It's just something that you have to keep paying.

[10:25] And so like, I feel like this is so important because this is what

[10:29] understanding this took me a very long time.

[10:31] And you must do the hard thing.

[10:34] And a lot of the hard thing is basically with standing the pain of knowing

[10:38] that there were mistakes being, you know, occurring in the business.

[10:40] There's cheering that's going up.

[10:41] And if we have these people, we wouldn't have this turn.

[10:43] But I can't change the business because I'm actively getting those people.

[10:47] So you just have to sit there and watch it burn.

[10:49] You have to be okay with the flaws.

[10:52] And it will drive you insane because as a person,

[10:54] you need to be the type of person who's not okay with flaws.

[10:56] But you have to be willing to deal with the flaws as they exist

[11:00] because you are already actively solving them.

[11:02] And you have to look at your team in the face and be like,

[11:04] yep, heard.

[11:05] And they're like, there's all these fires.

[11:06] You're like, yep, understood.

[11:08] What do we do about it?

[11:09] Right now we're already working on it.

[11:11] Well, why isn't it done yet?

[11:12] It's in progress.

[11:13] What?

[11:14] What?

[11:15] It's in progress.

[11:16] Well, shouldn't we do this in the meantime?

[11:17] No.

[11:18] We're just going to continue.

[11:19] We're going to endure.

[11:21] We're going to persist.

[11:22] We're going to deal.

[11:24] And I think that season is the part that is the hard part.

[11:27] And the thing is that season is literally never ending because as soon as you

[11:32] once, once you find your mechanics, you find your accountants.

[11:35] You find the software developers who are going to help you with your business.

[11:38] Whatever it is, right?

[11:39] As soon as you find those people, guess what happens?

[11:42] Something else will break and you'll have some things that are fast fixes.

[11:45] And you'll fix those fast.

[11:47] But some fixes are slow fixes.

[11:48] And the slow fixes are the one that are going to be the vast majority of business

[11:51] career because the fast fixes are only there for a small period of time because you've

[11:55] deal with the pain.

[11:56] You see the solution?

[11:57] And you saw that done over.

[12:00] But then as soon as you go fast fast fast slow, then you just got to stick with that slow

[12:04] one until it's solved.

[12:06] This is what makes it hard.

[12:08] And it's not that your business isn't scalable.

[12:09] It's that you want scaling to be easier.

[12:11] And that's the issue.

[12:12] Your business isn't broken.

[12:13] You don't need to change the business.

[12:15] You need to deal with the fact that solution's take time.

[12:18] And that this might just be a feature of the business you're in.

[12:20] Now, part of you might think, well, if this is a feature of the business that I'm in,

[12:24] I don't want to have this business.

[12:25] OK.

[12:26] Well, let's walk through that.

[12:28] So hypothetically, if you were very good at solving that problem, would that be a problem

[12:32] that you'd be more okay with dealing with?

[12:35] Maybe.

[12:36] And if you're considering an alternative path, you should also consider the alternative

[12:38] problems.

[12:39] Right?

[12:40] You're like, why want to do something else?

[12:41] OK, tell me all the things that suck about that path because I promise there are things

[12:45] that suck about that path.

[12:46] And then the file question that is, are you better equipped to solve those problems?

[12:50] Now, in the hypothetical world, you always think you're better equipped to solve those problems.

[12:54] But oftentimes, you've never even solved them before.

[12:57] And maybe the problems you think that are there are not actually the real problems.

[13:00] The real problems are much deeper and more in affairs than the ones you're currently

[13:03] doing with.

[13:04] And so I think that there's something so deep about the saying, the devil you know.

[13:08] Right?

[13:09] Is that like, the business is the devil you know.

[13:10] And you've maybe been doing this for a year or two years or five years or 10 years,

[13:13] however long you've been in industry 20 years.

[13:15] The thing is, is the long you've been in industry, the more you've mapped the system.

[13:20] You've more than mapped the terrain.

[13:21] You understand the good and you understand the bad and you understand what to do about the

[13:25] bad.

[13:26] And so fundamentally, problems will not end.

[13:30] And I think this is like, it's almost like a human problem that exists with entrepreneurs

[13:33] is that they want problems to stop and they will never stop.

[13:37] They will never stop.

[13:38] You're wishing for something that does not exist.

[13:40] And in so doing, you're consistently changing things about the business that is working.

[13:44] It's probably the same thing for people who have from relationship relationship relationship.

[13:47] Is it what I think I would have, I would have found a relationship that has no problems.

[13:50] Is not good.

[13:51] It's not going to happen.

[13:52] You're not going to find it.

[13:53] But the biggest problem is all of all is that you think that there shouldn't be

[13:56] problems.

[13:57] You have a problem with your problems.

[13:58] And that problem is solvable.

[14:00] You decide that there isn't a problem with having problems.

[14:02] You accept that having problems is a fact of life.

[14:05] It's a fact of business.

[14:07] It's a fact of whatever you're trying to go.

[14:09] Like, find me $100 million, $10 million, billion dollar, billion dollar.

[14:13] Watch Pterra, who says, I got here and there were no problems.

[14:16] In fact, today I have actually solved all of my problems.

[14:20] It doesn't happen.

[14:21] And so we have this demand.

[14:22] We have this wish.

[14:23] And that wish is the actual biggest problem in your business because it's the thing that's

[14:27] causing you to break the thing that's working.

[14:28] And this is where you need to give time time.

[14:30] You need to give solutions time to breathe.

[14:32] And you need to give solutions time to work.

[14:34] And as always, once the solution actually happens, play it out.

[14:37] Let's say that we've got, we finally fixed our accounting, our accounting recruiting problems.

[14:42] And now I have lots of accountants.

[14:43] We've created a whole school for accounting.

[14:45] We need 20 partnerships with different accounting schools.

[14:47] And now we have this.

[14:48] We have guys banging down the doorbell like, man, I would love to work for you.

[14:51] What's your problem now?

[14:53] Well, you know what?

[14:54] Now that I've got all these accounts, I've got all these guys with empty, empty calendars.

[14:57] They could, I've so much more capacity of overpaying in payroll because I've got all these

[15:01] guys.

[15:02] But I need to get more customers.

[15:03] And so what do you do?

[15:04] You start marketing more.

[15:05] But now the customers are coming because you're trying to fill slats here.

[15:08] You're lowering your bar.

[15:09] You're taking worse quality customers.

[15:11] Now your term becomes an issue.

[15:13] And your margins start going down because you can't charge these people as much.

[15:16] And you've already taken on more fixed costs because you started hiring all these people.

[15:19] Huh?

[15:20] Is this sounding familiar?

[15:21] These are sounding like business problems.

[15:23] Because wouldn't it be convenient if that accountant would say, hey, I will wait here

[15:27] patiently until you have acquired 20 accounts of appropriate size.

[15:32] And then, and only then, will I choose to come on board?

[15:34] And at that moment, you can collect their revenue.

[15:36] And all of these customers will say, you know what?

[15:38] I will wait in line until you get 19 more customers just like me.

[15:41] And then all at once, we will start working with this new account that you're bringing in

[15:45] so that your payroll and your revenue can match.

[15:48] Wouldn't that be nice?

[15:49] It also be nice if this table was made of gold or diamonds.

[15:52] Be sweeter for your diamond or add a mantom, even cooler.

[15:55] But very unlikely.

[15:57] And so if you want to be in the wishing game, then maybe entrepreneurship isn't the right

[16:01] path free.

[16:02] But if you want to live in the real world, you have to accept that there will be problems.

[16:06] And there will be things and they typically revolve around one core issue, which is the

[16:10] delta between your expectations around time.

[16:13] So let me explain what I mean by this.

[16:15] Probably fourth concept.

[16:16] The problem isn't your expectations of the business.

[16:19] Your problem is the timeline of those expectations.

[16:22] If you want to change the world, you absolutely can't.

[16:24] I believe that wholeheartedly.

[16:25] I think any one person, any one man, anyone woman can change the world.

[16:28] I believe that.

[16:29] But not tomorrow.

[16:30] It will probably take time.

[16:32] It will take infrastructure.

[16:33] It will take help.

[16:34] It will take a movement.

[16:35] And we'll take many other people helping you along the way.

[16:38] And that does not happen overnight.

[16:40] Like there's the same room wasn't built in the dead.

[16:42] And it's true.

[16:43] It wasn't.

[16:44] And so now I'll give you a realistic timeline.

[16:47] I think I work on, which is I work in decades.

[16:51] And the reason I choose that number is that you can go from new idea to massive global company

[16:57] in about 10 years.

[16:58] You look at zero to a Microsoft, which they ipod at about seven years.

[17:02] You look at like obviously opening eyes.

[17:05] Like we saw their very rapid growth, but they're also they worked since like 2017.

[17:10] And now they're right, like eight years in.

[17:12] So again, seven years, six years.

[17:15] I I round a little higher because you know, I don't think I'm Elon Musk and maybe you

[17:20] don't think you are either.

[17:21] And if you're politically charged about it, pick a different entrepreneur, whatever.

[17:24] The point is, the rush you have is imaginary.

[17:28] It's not real.

[17:29] It's in your head.

[17:30] You're made it up to get to where by when why?

[17:33] Like why?

[17:34] Like we have to double this year.

[17:35] Why?

[17:36] Maybe the fact that you think you have to double this year is the reason you'll never

[17:38] double over the next five years because you keep trying to cut corners.

[17:42] You can't build it right.

[17:43] And because you don't build it right, you don't get the right people in on the front.

[17:46] And you don't get people right people in the back end.

[17:47] You get the wrong talent.

[17:48] You get the wrong customers.

[17:49] You keep turning this up because of arbitrary, arbitrary, completely made up lines that

[17:53] you draw on the sand and say, this must occur.

[17:55] And so I think if you, you can have the business you want, just not by the time they

[18:00] you want it.

[18:01] And so I don't think you need to change your dreams.

[18:02] I think you need to change your time with.

[18:04] And so the idea that your business isn't scalable is actually yet again in relation to

[18:08] speed of course it's scalable.

[18:10] It's just not as scalable.

[18:11] It doesn't scale as fast as you'd like it to.

[18:13] And what part of this can we change?

[18:15] The as you'd like it to that part you can change.

[18:17] Now of course you could advertise more.

[18:19] You could try to hire bigger, we're hurting team within the constraints of your business.

[18:22] Given the resources you have, sure.

[18:23] Of course you can argue more resources.

[18:25] But you're not going to solve it.

[18:26] These are features.

[18:27] And so I think a lot of people are wishing for a business that has no difficulty.

[18:30] And if you find it, let me know.

[18:32] But I've yet to see it and I've looked at a lot of businesses.

[18:35] And so I say this because many of you probably won't need to change your business.

[18:39] Probably need to keep doing the business you're on.

[18:41] Number two, the business you're on is probably scalable.

[18:44] All businesses are scalable.

[18:45] It's just how hard is it to scale.

[18:47] And when we translate hard into what problems must I solve in order to scale it.

[18:51] And what are the alternative problems to this path that would have to encounter if I

[18:54] didn't follow this path, which you'll find are often also equally difficult.

[18:58] And probably you're less equipped to solve them because you've never solved them before.

[19:00] And so the idea is I want no problem.

[19:02] But really you're only trading problems.

[19:04] And so when you're thinking about, I want this to not be this way.

[19:07] Think about what problems you'd rather have.

[19:09] There's a big, big, big pile of problems than the table.

[19:12] All the business owners are tossing them in in the middle.

[19:16] And it's like you got to throw your cards in.

[19:18] You're problems in.

[19:19] You got to pick somebody else's.

[19:20] When you look at everybody else's, I'm like, I don't know.

[19:23] I don't know if I would pick them up.

[19:24] And the thing is the longer you deal with your problems, the better you get it dealing

[19:27] with them.

[19:28] Kind of like the longer you've dated somebody, you're like, I kind of know how to do it this

[19:30] person.

[19:31] I know how to do it with their crazy.

[19:32] Right?

[19:33] And over time, they kind of know how to deal with your crazy.

[19:35] Right?

[19:36] So your business probably is in broken.

[19:37] It's probably just not growing as fast as you want because you are demanding that it grow faster.

[19:41] But you are in so doing, trying to break things about your business that we're making it work

[19:46] in order to get it to not work so that you no longer have that problem and you create another

[19:50] problem.

[19:51] And now you have two problems to solve, which is harder than one.

[19:52] For timelines or the biggest issue in the business.

[19:55] And the fact that it is hard is a feature not a buck.

[19:58] And the vast majority of your business career will be spent waiting in painful tolerance

[20:03] of the solutions that you are implementing to kick in.

[20:07] And you have to deal with the last things of life while that's happening and look at

[20:11] everyone in that team in the eyes and say, we are working on it.

[20:14] And they're going to be like, well, why don't we change this?

[20:15] And you have to look at them and say, no.

[20:17] And they're going to say, but there's this fire.

[20:19] And you're like, yeah, but if we do your thing, they're going to have another fire.

[20:22] And we're also going to incur the cost of change between both scenarios, which I'd rather

[20:26] just have pain one, rather than pain two and cost of change pain pain three.

[20:31] And so what it is, it's erratic.

[20:32] It's frenetic energy.

[20:33] It's the feeling like you must do something.

[20:35] And if you do, if you do have that energy and you're like, man, I kind of do something

[20:38] about it.

[20:39] Go to what you're actually trying to do with the solution and try and promote yourself.

[20:43] Go do take some of the interviews yourself, try and speed up the cycles there.

[20:46] By all means, try and speed up.

[20:47] It's just not going to eliminate it.

[20:48] These will be features.

[20:49] These will be things that you live with.

[20:50] It'll leave you with one thought.

[20:52] There's an old, there's an old saying, an old bull in a young bull.

[20:55] And they see a bunch of pretty cows at the bottom of a bottom of hell.

[20:58] And so the young bull's looking at the old bull and he's like, hey, let's chase.

[21:02] Let's go run down there and see if we can catch one to procreate with.

[21:07] And the old bull's like, no, that's a terrible idea.

[21:10] And he's like, why?

[21:11] He's like, well, because if we charge down there, he's like, they're all going to scatter

[21:13] in the young bull's like, yeah, but I'm going to take this, you know, we'll each get one.

[21:18] He's like, yeah, but if we walk down the hell slowly, he's like, we can procreate with

[21:21] them all.

[21:22] Now, how does this related business?

[21:23] Does this mean that if I take my time, I can pursue every single entrepreneurial endeavor?

[21:28] I actually think that within the context of entrepreneurship, it's backwards.

[21:31] You're never going to sleep with all the women.

[21:33] You can't.

[21:34] There are so many businesses that exist.

[21:36] And the reason for that, and you have more ideas than you have time.

[21:39] And I think that there is a, there's a, there's a fixed cost that we must accept that it

[21:43] will likely take.

[21:44] If you really want to go big, it's going to, like, look at the biggest businesses.

[21:47] They're 20, 30, 40 years old.

[21:51] And you're like, well, I'm 30 now.

[21:53] It's like, right, that means a two year 70, one thing.

[21:55] You just keep growing it.

[21:56] And so what does that mean downstream?

[21:59] It means that there are opportunities, not just some opportunities, but all other opportunities

[22:05] besides the one that you're currently working on, you will have to say no to it.

[22:08] Think about that reality.

[22:09] Like, let it settle with you because you have to come to peace with it.

[22:12] And the fact that you haven't come to peace with it is why you keep wanting to pursue

[22:16] all of these things.

[22:17] But by pursuing all of them, you will get none of them.

[22:20] You can't sleep with all the women in the world.

[22:22] Doesn't matter what your, what your novelty desire is, like, you have to understand that

[22:26] this is fact of life.

[22:28] You're not going to start every business.

[22:29] You're not even going to start every great idea you have.

[22:31] You're not even going to start 20% of the great ideas you have.

[22:35] 10% 5% 1 out of 20.

[22:37] 1 out of 100.

[22:38] You're going to have one idea.

[22:39] And then you're going to have to keep sticking with it because that's where all the gains

[22:42] come in.

[22:43] It comes in the compounding.

[22:44] It comes in the sticking with it.

[22:46] Right?

[22:47] The hard part about the plan isn't thinking about the plan or doing the plan.

[22:50] That's sticking with the plan.

[22:51] That's the hard part of the plan.

[22:53] And believe me, in the frustration that I'm having, the reason I'm like, almost shouting

[22:56] like this is because I'm shouting at me.

[22:57] I'm not shouting at you.

[22:58] I'm shouting at me.

[22:59] Because it's so hard.

[23:00] Like this is what's hard.

[23:01] It's the hard because it's a muscle you're not used to.

[23:03] It's a skill that you have to learn.

[23:04] If it's a treat, you have to flex over and over and over again.

[23:07] And I will say this.

[23:08] The more you say no, the better you get at it.

[23:10] It never goes away hard it is.

[23:12] It just gets a little bit easier.

[23:13] Just needs a little bit easier with time.

[23:16] And eventually I think you'll know that you will have appropriately flexed that muscle

[23:20] when you can have no foammo.

[23:23] If you can hear that someone else is doing great and be like, that's amazing for them.

[23:27] I know my game.

[23:28] I've been doing this for six years.

[23:29] I've been doing this for eight years.

[23:30] I'm going to keep doing my game.

[23:32] And a thing a lot of it is that we have this desire for permanence.

[23:35] We have this desire for legacy.

[23:37] We have this desire to to live forever.

[23:39] When outside of Bryan Johnson, no one else is really talking about that.

[23:42] And up until this point, the death rate on humans is 100%.

[23:44] And the forget the likely at a forgetting of a human's life is also close to 100%.

[23:50] And of the people who are remembered, they're not remembered by the people they know.

[23:53] They're remembered by people they don't know.

[23:54] And by the way, they're dead.

[23:56] And so we have this desire and I think it just comes into direct conflict with the idea that

[24:00] we just live finite lives.

[24:01] Time moves fast and you think, and the younger you are, the less you realize the older

[24:04] you are, the more you start going, man, that was pretty quick.

[24:06] You only have a couple, a couple, big bullets in you.

[24:10] You've got a couple decades, you know, a couple still.

[24:12] So a few.

[24:13] A three four, maybe seasons.

[24:16] And if you really want to go big and something starts working, then you're going to

[24:18] do that thing for 34 years.

[24:21] And so like the idea of like, oh, man, oh, no, these have it like, you have divisions within

[24:25] a business, if it makes sense.

[24:26] But most of the time it doesn't.

[24:27] Most of the time, you could start this other thing or you could just do more of the things

[24:30] already working.

[24:31] Why is it happening faster?

[24:32] Because you're demanding that it happened faster.

[24:34] But there's nothing wrong with your an error business.

[24:35] You're saying the problem is a problem that you created.

[24:38] Basically, you just take reality.

[24:39] You move the line of your expectations.

[24:40] And then you say, there's a problem.

[24:41] But I see more businesses ruined because of that than just about anything else.

[24:45] You could make it work if you just stuck with it.

[24:47] And you stop thinking that there's something wrong with your business.

[24:50] And maybe look at the fact that there might be something wrong with your expectation.

[24:53] That's what I got.

[24:54] That's my Thursday, Thursday, Thursday, Thursday, Thursday, Thursday, Thursday, Thursday,

[24:57] Thursday, Thursday, Thursday, Thursday, Thursday, Thursday, Thursday, Thursday.

[24:57] It's a certain.

[24:58] If you like this video, I made a video about figuring out whether your business is

[25:01] supplier or demand constrained for like, I don't know which one it is.

[25:05] And you can go check that out around my head somewhere.

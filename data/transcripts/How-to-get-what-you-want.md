[00:00] The hardest respect to earn is one's own.

[00:02] Over the years, my wife and I created Acquisition.com, which is a portfolio of companies that says about 85 million dollars a year.

[00:07] I get questions all the time in terms of like, how do you create these businesses?

[00:11] How do you self-suff, how do you live your life, all of those kinds of things?

[00:14] And I was talking to a good friend to come back into my life briefly.

[00:18] We actually started at the same time together.

[00:21] There was a, there was a, there was a period of time that he did significantly better than me.

[00:25] Just from a financial perspective, and then I ended up passing him.

[00:27] And we met back up a few years later, and he was a little bit down.

[00:31] And the conversation that we had was really enlightening for me and the conversations we had since.

[00:35] And so I wanted to share that with you.

[00:37] The main purpose for this video, as I'm getting to it, is to underline how do you actually do this stuff

[00:44] that creates the wealth, the empire, the status, the all that stuff?

[00:48] And I think that this is where people get really tripped up.

[00:51] The reason I say that is there's kind of three elements to the goal, right?

[00:55] So you have the external result that you're looking forward, which might be make more money,

[00:58] get a six pack, whatever.

[00:59] You've got the process of behavior's activity that result in that goal, right?

[01:05] Being achieved, which should be like doing the work.

[01:07] The third aspect is being the type of person who does those things.

[01:11] So basically identifying with those types of behaviors or being the type of person who does

[01:17] those types of activities, which then creates the reward.

[01:20] Right? I think James Clear talks about this in his book, Atomic Habits, but there's a lot of

[01:24] behaviors likeologists who've touched on this point.

[01:26] And you probably have heard B do have at some point in your personal development journey.

[01:30] And if you haven't, welcome to the game.

[01:32] And so one of the things, and this is what I wanted to give to you in this in this video, is

[01:37] a keystone habit that has served me very well.

[01:40] And it's only been in retrospect explaining it to someone else that I kind of had more clarity on it,

[01:45] which is why I'm sharing it with you.

[01:46] When I have something that I want that I do not have.

[01:49] So I have a desire, which means I've made a contract with myself to be unhappy until I get what I want.

[01:54] And so I have this thing that I want externally.

[01:56] And I think I've had enough experience with this to know that simply writing down the goal means nothing.

[02:01] And so I think this is contrary to common belief or practice, which is like people write down their

[02:05] goals or more likely to succeed. Sure, I mean having a direction is more likely to achieve than

[02:09] then having a direction. So I'm not going to disagree with that.

[02:12] But here's an interesting statement that may hit you, which is that winners and losers have the same

[02:17] goals. Right? Everybody in Olympics has the same goal.

[02:20] Everybody who's in business has the same goal. Right? They want to increase how much money they're making.

[02:24] You sell more products, get more customers, etc. So the goals are actually not that unique.

[02:28] And so the fact that we're writing them down, sure it's a first step because we have to have a

[02:31] direction in terms of what are we trying to accomplish? Sure. But I think that what you'll see that is

[02:36] different because if you look at two people with the same goals and one person achieves them

[02:39] the other person hasn't, then it can't be having the goal that is the main driver of success. Right?

[02:44] Right? And so then you, you know, do you dive a step underneath of that and you look at

[02:48] what are the behaviors that created that goal? And now we get much closer to the things that are actually

[02:52] driving the progress. What gets more interesting, at least to me, is if we know the activities that

[02:57] are going to generate the result we want. So maybe it's we want to get more customers, which means

[03:00] we need to advertise more. And I use advertised by the definition of what the word actually means,

[03:04] which is to make note. And so if we do activities that make our products and services known,

[03:08] like doing more private communications, it's going to be 101 reachouts, 101 cold calls, 101 DMs,

[03:13] 101 emails, etc. prospecting, or one to many, so public communication,

[03:18] which would be broadcasting across different platforms for media, right? So you have radio.

[03:24] You could have an email list. You could have actually that would be an example of a hydrogen of scale

[03:28] of the original. So I apologize there, but like making posts on social media, things that are public

[03:32] for more people can find out about it. Right? If you do more of those things, more people find out.

[03:36] And that would be the activity that's associated with getting more customers, right?

[03:39] But the thing is, is that people will know what that activity is, right? They will know that,

[03:43] inherently, they should be doing more of it, and yet they don't. And so that is kind of the purpose

[03:48] that I wanted to drill down in this short video today is why not? And what is the way that we can

[03:54] try and correct that or fix that? I wanted to give you the simplest single hack that I have used

[04:00] inadvertently and seen a tremendous amount of success. That is asking myself the question,

[04:06] what would a person who does this type of thing do in this instance? The one that I'll tell you

[04:11] that I've repeated a lot to myself over the years, probably over the last five or 10 years,

[04:16] has been the repeated chorus of what would a wise man do? I think it's because I did not

[04:21] consider myself to be very wise and I acted many ways that were unwise, earlier,

[04:27] hunting my life, and I still continue to do so, but I tried to do less of it, right? And I think that,

[04:32] and I'll borrow this again from James Kursburg, your identity is much more of a weighing system,

[04:37] actually there's nothing. But like it's much more of a voting system where you cast votes on

[04:41] either direction, based on your activities and what type of person you want to become. And I think

[04:45] the simplest distillation of that concept is simply asking the question, what would this type of

[04:51] person do? If you can use that as the refrain that you come back to over and over again, the chorus

[04:56] of your day that gets repeated over and over again, I think it's much easier than trying to remember

[05:02] the 50 point checklist of all the activities that you need to do to achieve the goal. In the

[05:07] friend that came back in my life, we were having this conversation. I just distilled it down to like,

[05:12] what would a billionaire do? And so when we're confronted with these crossroads, right, you wake up in

[05:17] the morning and you're like, I don't know what I should start on. I'm like, what would a billionaire do?

[05:20] And so basically what you can do is have a certain refrain or chorus that you ask yourself,

[05:26] what would this type of person do? And that type of person, when you ask that question,

[05:30] is who you will eventually become as you continue to cast votes that reinforce the stories that

[05:34] we tell ourselves about who we are? And those are the things that create long-lasting deep change.

[05:40] And what's more about this is that these changes, when they become internal, when they become

[05:45] ingrained in our behavior, they become effortless, but it takes time. And so I think that the

[05:51] mental cue that I have given myself inadvertently over the years, I don't have a lot of

[05:56] choruses that I refrain to, are that I come back to over and over again. And so I tweeted about

[06:01] one and I got shared a zillion times, what would someone ten times smarter than me doing this

[06:05] situation, right? And a different way of saying that is what would a billionaire do? And word it in

[06:09] whatever way that resonates with you. But I think rather than having that big checklist, you can put

[06:15] just a little post at under computer or wherever you work that's a reminder to yourself that

[06:21] this is the type of person I want to become. And in order to become this type of person, I need to

[06:26] do these things because those actions will reinforce the thoughts that I say about myself because

[06:31] the whole concept behind affirmations that I do not like, right, which is IMA, you know, I'm a lion,

[06:36] I'm a tiger, I'm a whatever, right? Just saying them doesn't make them true unless you're a crazy

[06:40] person. And most of us are not crazy, I think, right? There's plenty of crates, we don't be wrong,

[06:45] but if you're probably watching this turn, you're probably least some, I say, right? If we have,

[06:49] this degree of sanity that's on our side, then what we have to do is create something else,

[06:53] which is evidence. We have to give ourselves evidence that we are this type of person in order to

[06:58] become that. But how do you have evidence that you're going to be this person when you have none?

[07:02] Well, it starts with activity. It starts with doing the stuff. And is it added co-relear depending

[07:06] on the goal that you have? It might be what would a person with a six pack do? What would a

[07:10] pro-champion bodybuilder do? What would an amazing husband do? Or what would the best husband in the

[07:16] world do? And so you can use this framework of asking the question of what your ideal self would

[07:20] do in any given circumstance to apply to a vast number of scenarios rather than trying to fix

[07:25] for the habit, fix for the being. And then the habits will take care of themselves in accordance

[07:30] with the type of person that you have stated, you wish to become. And so then the goals we have

[07:35] become becoming the person we want to be. Once we know who we want to become, then that can direct

[07:42] the types of activities that will be in accordance with that. And the reason I like this better

[07:45] too is that if we're trying to reinforce an identity or an identity trait about ourselves,

[07:50] this is a really good habit. I think that I've picked up over the years. But breaking down the

[07:54] etymology of words is really, really cool. And I think really teaches us a lot about the words we say.

[08:01] And words matter a lot because they are the things that encapsulate thoughts. A classic one which is like

[08:06] I didn't really like the word floss works that I thought it sounded really fluffy. When I found out

[08:10] the etymology behind the word, which is filet, which is to love or to like. And then so close,

[08:14] which is knowledge or wisdom, it's love or wisdom. And I was like, well, shoot, I am a lover of wisdom.

[08:19] And so now I actually have a very positive association with the word. And to the same degree,

[08:23] identity comes from like, I don't remember the actual word, but entity is being, right? Like,

[08:29] just being this and it's in it of itself. And identical, which is repeated. So repeated being,

[08:34] this is what your identity is. So what your actions, what you do, literally becomes who you are.

[08:39] Which means that we can actively change who we are by changing what we do. But it is a reinforcing

[08:44] circular path of like, I am this type of person and therefore I do these things. And because they

[08:48] do these types of things, I am this type of person, right? And so it's the chicken or the egg. But at some point,

[08:52] we need to take action in order to do that. And so I think the simple and easiest cue that we can

[08:58] use to change we are to change character traits that we find undesirable is to simply ask ourselves

[09:04] when we're confronted with the decision, what would this type of person do? And then act in accordance

[09:11] to that. And I find it much simpler than having the lists and having the daily routines and the

[09:16] things like that. Because if you are this type of person, you will do the types of things that

[09:21] that type of person would do. And that also comes down to the many decisions we have in a

[09:26] counted for you. You're going to be confronted with situations that you have not predicted.

[09:30] In fact, the vast majority of us don't predict things well in general, it's because there's far more

[09:34] variables and we can possibly comprehend. I think it's much more useful for us to think about

[09:39] ourselves in terms of if I were to encompass all of the things that I would like to be. Right?

[09:45] And that's why I think the what would Jesus do was such a powerful statement in the Christian

[09:50] community of Rome. And candidly, people outside of the Christian community could use that same

[09:54] exact thing, which what would Jesus do in this instance? And probably get the right

[09:57] activity and become more like Jesus, right? Which is the entire goal of the Christian faith.

[10:02] And if it makes it easier for you to think in a more tangible sense when you're asking yourself

[10:07] the question, I think the reason the Jesus thing was so powerful is that there's a very real

[10:11] identity that they're associating this decision with. The ones that I asked are what would King Solomon

[10:17] do, which he was considered one of the richest and wisest men, which is why it's someone that I

[10:22] I revert back to. And the other person that I ask myself was what would they do in this situation?

[10:27] It's Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger. When I ask myself that question, and it depends on the scenario

[10:32] which person I'm going to draw on to answer the question, depending on what suits best,

[10:38] you know, what best suits the objective, et cetera. But I think if you can, if you don't know

[10:42] someone that you can make it the value or the version of yourself with that value, or you can just

[10:48] use an external person that embodies a lot of the character traits that you hope to have and that

[10:52] can be equally as effective. So it just depends on who you are. But I think any of those are good

[10:56] strategies that you can employ to maximally use this kind of tactic for self-improvement and self-change.

[11:03] What we repeatedly choose to ask ourselves, which creates our identity, which then creates the tasks

[11:09] that we do in the activities we spend our time on, reinforces the story that we tell ourselves about who we are.

[11:14] Or what type of person we are? What I shared with this individual, I said, you know, what do you want

[11:18] to become? And if it's like a billionaire, it's like cool, then what would a billionaire do?

[11:21] And always asking ourselves that question. And the reason that this was important when I was talking

[11:26] to this individual, I'll read to the texts that I had that I had said to him because they got shared

[11:29] all over Instagram when I tweeted them or whatever. As I actually left, I said, here's a thought for you.

[11:34] So I was just thinking about the conversation we had and he had felt kind of shitty. And what's

[11:38] interesting about this is like, as you level up in your life and this is just an observation

[11:42] that I've had is that like you will simply change where you compare yourself to. And I think

[11:46] Jordan Peterson talks about this in some talk he had. But I find it very true, which is you just

[11:50] change where you compare yourself to. And so you always find a way to make yourself feel terrible.

[11:55] And even if you're the best in the world, what stuff you'll just look at people who are better at

[11:58] other things than you and compare yourself to them to make yourself feel bad. This is what I said to him

[12:02] and I'll share it with you. I said, every winner and every loser have the same goals. What separates

[12:06] them are the activities they commit to committing to the activities that is the goal. So commit to the

[12:11] activities, that is the goal. When you make a lot of money one month, you've achieved nothing because the

[12:16] goal is the activities. And then later I said, do me a favor instead of writing down your goals,

[12:22] just write down what would a billionaire who lost it all do or what would a billionaire do to keep

[12:26] it simple or whatever version of yourself you want to be. The doing and the outcomes will happen as

[12:31] a result of the main internal identity shift, which you can reinforce many times a day by asking

[12:35] yourself that question to each cross road. And so I think that was relatively, you know, I think

[12:40] it's a good point to end off on, which is the only tactical ask that I have for you is to simply write

[12:46] down what type of person do I wish to become. And then make that the chorus that you recite to

[12:51] yourself when you're at your crossroads, when you're at your decision points that are going to

[12:56] create who you are on a repeated basis every single day. And I think going back to that refrain

[13:01] will be all encompassing in terms of what would Jesus do applies to his zillion scenarios, but everyone

[13:07] at least in the Christian faith, I know you said it because it's a very simple catch all,

[13:09] would want to become more Christ like. Right. And so whatever the Christ version is for you,

[13:15] we can steal from that concept and continually reinforce it by asking yourselves those questions.

[13:21] And if you ask yourself the next Josh question, which is, well, Alex, I don't know what a billionaire

[13:24] or do I don't know what an IVB pro champ would do or I don't know what a, okay, well there's

[13:29] two ways you can see this. Number one is that most people know what they need to do to lose weight,

[13:33] but they don't actually do it. So I think that I could push back on the vast majority of people and say,

[13:37] no, you probably do know that. And I like this saying a lot, which is, we need to be reminded more

[13:42] than we need to be taught. Most people know they should be doing more than they're currently

[13:44] doing in order to achieve their goals. And I think an example of that is if your family were kidnapped,

[13:49] you would probably act differently, right, when you were trying to save them, because you would

[13:55] take significantly more massive action in order to do so, right? You would take huge action in order

[14:00] to accomplish the goals, which also means that you're the type of person who wants to save their

[14:04] family, which is actually kind of a total side note here, right? But in, in doing that you already knew

[14:09] it to do all along, you just weren't taking the action. Now, that's if that's the vast majority of

[14:13] situations is covered with that example. But if you're in the minority of situations, right, which is like,

[14:18] well, I don't know how to become a billionaire, right? Well, what are the things that would lead you

[14:22] towards that, right? Which might be like maybe you need to lower it a little bit, which is what

[14:25] would a millionaire know? And if it's not that, then what would somebody who's trying to become a millionaire

[14:29] do? And they would probably talk to miners or whatever, or talk to people like the thing is,

[14:34] if you really want to go about enough, you can ask the question in such a way that you would be able

[14:39] to answer it and make progress, right? And then the nature of the question self can develop over time

[14:44] as you discover what you believe you need to do. And I really will say this again,

[14:49] the vast majority of us know what we need to do. We're just simply not doing it. And I think attacking

[14:54] why we're not doing it is a much more fruitful conversation than trying to discover the secrets of

[14:59] the universe. Because the people who achieve the really extraordinary things do the uncommonly obvious

[15:04] thing for an inordinate period of time. And that is what separates them is that they are doing it

[15:09] because it is who they are, rather than something to achieve an outcome that is finite and external

[15:14] that they don't have control over. Because if you are doing it for who you are, you will continue

[15:17] to play the game indefinitely, which will give you the outsest returns versus the person who is doing

[15:22] it to make money, which means that when they do make money one month, they pull back on the gas,

[15:26] because they accomplish their objective of doing the external thing rather than being who they are,

[15:30] or more who they want to be. And so if you're new to the channel by the way, welcome, my name's Alex,

[15:35] like I said earlier, my wife and I own Aquasiz.com. It's a company that buys minority interests in

[15:41] service-based info, coaching, digital product type businesses, and then helps them scale to like

[15:46] 30-50 million in beyond. And that's what we do full time, but I do this stuff just because I

[15:51] struggle to lot on the way up and I don't want other people to struggle and I don't want my pain to

[15:54] be in vain, and so that is why I make these videos. So, walking to imagination, lots of love,

[15:58] and I'll see you guys in the next video. Bye!

[00:00] Wasting money sucks.

[00:01] And in six months, I saved one of our profilic companies

[00:04] $2 million in bottom line profit.

[00:07] And I'm going to show you the props they were suffering from,

[00:09] the solutions we did, and takeaways you can use in your business today

[00:13] to increase customer satisfaction, decrease refunds,

[00:16] get more people to buy your next thing or upsell,

[00:19] and decrease the dreaded charge back.

[00:21] Enjoy. So this business was a SaaS business, which just stands for

[00:24] software as a service. And we had just implemented this software

[00:28] in the business 90 days earlier. And so we had a big spike in

[00:32] turn, decrease customer satisfaction scores,

[00:35] decrease number of people who were taking the next upsell,

[00:37] and other problems. And so the first problem that we wanted to attack was

[00:42] onboarding, meaning what does a customer do immediately after they buy?

[00:47] Now, if you don't have onboarding, I can tell you right now, if you add onboarding,

[00:50] you will significantly make customers happier and you'll get them to stay longer

[00:54] and pay more. So if you're not doing it, start there.

[00:56] Now, let me tell you the props with the onboarding is currently existed.

[00:59] So within onboarding, there were five main problems that I'm going to start with the first one.

[01:04] First off, it was one to many. So there were 25 new customers per call. So you imagine,

[01:09] you buy this thing, you get an email, they say, hey, schedule your onboarding call,

[01:12] you schedule a call, you hop on, and then you're like, wait, there's a whole bunch of other people here.

[01:16] And then when you're on the call, they actually stuff that they were going over,

[01:19] was really broad and kind of company-based. I was like, this is our mission, this is our vision,

[01:24] this what we're trying to do, these are our founders, this is our story, all the stuff that customers

[01:28] don't care about. Next, from a value perspective, they were having to deal like a third of the call

[01:35] was helping people reset their passwords for the software because they couldn't figure it out.

[01:40] This is an older demo, which I'll talk about a little bit later. So this is a 55 plus average

[01:46] demo avatar. Meaning these are older folks who are doing a technology business. So we needed to have

[01:52] way more hand-holding. I'm already showing a little bit of some of the solutioning.

[01:55] All right, so they were spending all their time resetting passwords and talking about really broad

[02:00] stuff. And at the very end of that one to many call, they were then kind of hard pitching the

[02:06] upsell, right? And so if someone didn't take that offer, there was no next steps for them to take.

[02:13] So it was basically like, hey, you bought this thing. Hey, we're going to tell you about the company.

[02:17] Oh, yeah, let's spend a third of this call helping individual people fix their individual

[02:21] passwords and then at the end, hey, you should buy our next thing. And people say, well, I don't

[02:25] want to buy that and then they say, good luck. This is a big company. And in some ways, you can take

[02:29] this says, if you do the right things right, you can still get a lot of things wrong and be successful.

[02:35] And this is a new product. And so I want to highlight this is that, especially if you have a

[02:39] large customer base and you start a new thing, you're usually going to have a huge on, you know,

[02:43] inflow in the beginning, that causes your infrastructure to break because if you were to sustain

[02:49] that level of sales flow as then you get thousands of customers to all start every day,

[02:53] then your infrastructure will be bigger. But it doesn't make sense to hire 100 reps just for three

[02:58] days and then fire them all. And so some of these problems are due to scale and the nature of

[03:04] releasing a new product in general. Lots of large companies have it happen. That's why there's lines

[03:08] out the door at Apple. That's the idea. Okay. So that was a series of problems number one.

[03:13] If you have a service or you have a software, notice how they're very similar. Onboarding is the

[03:18] first real touch point with the customer. And customers make their first impression of your business

[03:23] from the 24 to 48 hours post purchase, meaning everything that happens until then frames the

[03:29] entire rest of their experience with you. And so nailing that next 24 or 48 hours will increase how

[03:36] many people take your upsells, how long they stay. So literally like adding onboarding can

[03:40] at two, three months to your LTV if you have any kind of recurring service. And so right now if you're

[03:45] not doing it or just sending like an email with some lists on it, you're missing a massive revenue

[03:49] opportunity. So the first thing we did to fix this onboarding process was we ran a pilot. So to be

[03:54] clear, we didn't say, hey, let's break the entire business yet again. So we took 15% of new customers

[04:00] and put them through a different onboarding process to test whether this new onboarding process

[04:04] yielded better results than the current one. So what we did was we went from one to many, two,

[04:10] one on one. Now obviously part of the reason that we rolled this out slowly was because we didn't

[04:14] have the bend with to take on 25 new customers every hour, which is what we were doing here. We had

[04:20] one person doing six or eight calls with 25 customers each every single day. And so to scale that

[04:26] team it would have taken a lot of time and we definitely weren't going to risk it until we've

[04:30] proven it out. So that's the first thing we did. The second thing we did in the pilot is we actually

[04:34] followed the closer framework, which is a sales framework. You're like, wait, how does that apply

[04:39] to onboarding? Well guess what? Once someone makes a purchase, the last R of closer is reinforced

[04:44] the decision. And so that actually applies to onboarding. And so when you reinforce the decision,

[04:50] what we do is restate the C L and O again. So we say, hey, clarify why they're there, label them with

[04:56] a problem and then overview their past experience and then you're selling them again on the vacation,

[05:01] on what they're going to experience as a result of their past decision of buying. Now for a value

[05:07] perspective, first off establishing the goal and reminding them of the goal that they had is massive.

[05:14] And so I want to like look at you in the camera now. When we had Alan our software company

[05:17] and we simply changed the language that we onboarded people with. So we actually had a similar onboarding

[05:23] process, but we just said, hey, I know you said you wanted to make $10,000 a month extra with your

[05:28] agency or whatever. But why do you want that? Now they say, oh, well, I want to make this impact.

[05:33] I want to retire my wife where I want to, whatever the thing is. When we related them taking the

[05:38] next steps to the goal that they had stated, it doubled or triple. I can't remember the number.

[05:43] It was a lot. How many more people followed through? Because we said, we want to help you with that

[05:48] John. We want to help you retire your wife and these next three things are going to help you do that.

[05:53] And then they were like, oh, that's the reason I signed up and I am going to follow through. From

[05:57] the low value version of this where I was like, let me just listen to everybody resetting their passwords.

[06:02] We could give someone a one-on-one concert. Here's an experience of walking them through setting

[06:06] up their password correctly because it's a very low technically proficient audience that we're

[06:10] dealing with. So we would get them a quick win. So if this is you for your business, you want the

[06:15] quick win, which was getting their log in set up properly and showing them around the software.

[06:24] Now, here's the interesting part. If for whatever reason, something came up during the onboarding

[06:29] call, we would immediately connect them with support so we could get it handled on that call.

[06:34] And so that way at the end of every call for onboarding the people were live, they were set up,

[06:39] they had were logged in and they understood the basics of how to use the software to get

[06:44] the gold that they signed up for. Part of you's like, wait, so you did the one-on-one,

[06:49] you added the CLOS in the front of this, you got a quick win for them. Okay, but what about the sales?

[06:54] Like, this is cute Alex, but what about the money? I know. I'm just a bleeding hard and

[06:58] doesn't don't want to make money. No, I'm here to make money. I'm investor. I own this company. I want this to

[07:04] So what we did, and this is the interesting part, if you already are a business owner and you

[07:08] like this more in-depth stuff, we have workshops that we just started offering at Acquisitor.com

[07:12] at a headquartered in Vegas. And so if you want to see if you qualify for one of those,

[07:16] you can go to Acquisitor.com, hit scale, hopefully we'll talk to you then.

[07:19] Is that we found that when we had this one-on-one experience that restated the goals and all the

[07:23] stuff, guess what happened? We went from 20% of people ascending from the old process

[07:31] to 48% of people taking the ascension offer. So this is one of the things that has taken me a very

[07:39] long time to learn, which is when you're persuading a big part of the value equation,

[07:45] and if you don't know the value equation, four variables, dream outcome, receive likely to

[07:48] achievement, time delay, evidence-acquivice. How dialed and how tight your business is before you

[07:57] ask for money is a huge boost to the perceived likelihood of achievement. And so if everything

[08:04] that I've said to you up to this point, I've over-delivered on and I've delivered on time and

[08:09] made an exceptional experience for you. And I've given you the quick wins. I reminded you why

[08:13] you were here. You've got somebody who's got your full attention. Then when I make the next offer,

[08:18] you feel like it's very likely that I'm going to continue to do business the same way I already have.

[08:24] And so the best way to get someone to expect that they're going to get value in the future is

[08:27] provide value today. So the TLDR is we didn't need to be nearly as sales heavy because the quality

[08:33] of the service was so much higher that they said, if this is a taste of what I'm going to get

[08:37] later, I won't wait more of that. And let me give you a pro tip right now. If you're not sure

[08:44] what to upsell on the back of anything, there are two upsells that work in almost any business

[08:50] that I buy and I've seen across the zillions that I look at. More of that thing you just bought

[08:55] or more help with that thing you just bought. So people bought a thing and if you're like,

[09:00] why don't we unobsel them immediately? Well, they bought it. So they probably want more of it or they

[09:04] want more help with that thing they just bought. And so you can get huge uptakes on upsells

[09:10] immediately after someone makes the first purchase. Let me give you a little tip. So most small

[09:14] business owners are afraid of asking for too much. They're like, hey, this person just bought for me.

[09:19] I don't want to see pushy. I don't want to make more offers. But if you believe in what you sell

[09:24] and someone has a problem, then it's my belief that you have an ethical duty to present them the

[09:28] offer. You don't have to hard close them, but you should let them know that you've made this offer

[09:34] or the solution available to them. Because buying the way most people think about it is that

[09:38] people buy on these regular intervals. But that's actually not the case at all. What happens is

[09:43] someone has a problem and then in a very short period of time, they make all their purchases.

[09:49] And then they make almost none. So think about it this way. If I wanted to start running a marathon,

[09:55] what would I do? I'd sign up for a marathon and then I'd be like, oh shoot, I need marathon shoes.

[09:59] So then I go to the shoe store and buy marathon shoes. And if they go, you know what? I don't have

[10:03] any running shorts. I only have the shorts that are basketball shorts. So I need get some running

[10:06] shorts. So I buy running shorts. Then I'm like, oh, I got one of those tank tops. Okay.

[10:10] Oh, you know what? I have an iPod, but I don't have an arm sleeve for it. So it's going to fall out.

[10:13] Oh, are there headphones that are better for running? So it doesn't fall out of my head?

[10:16] Now, the small business owner, most people watching this, say, wait, I only sell shoes.

[10:22] I don't want to offer them shorts and a tank top and headphones. But guess what's Susie's going to

[10:28] do? She's going to go take all of this after you made the hard sale of getting her to sign up for a

[10:33] marathon. And she's going to go to the guy down the street because he's a real business owner. And

[10:37] he's like, hey, she's in a buying window. She's in a hyper buying frenzy. And we need to capitalize

[10:42] on it in that moment. Now, how likely is it after she's bought all that stuff? Now, Adam the average

[10:48] business owner, he's like, hey, now that you've been running for 30 days, do you want an iPod case?

[10:53] And she's like, well, dude, I've been running for 30 days. I already got it from above average,

[10:58] Andrew down the street. He already sold me all the stuff. I need things. And guess where she's

[11:02] going to go from here on out? The guy who sold it the most stuff, most businesses have some sort of

[11:08] shift that happens in someone's identity when they make a purchase. They say, I am an author now. I'm

[11:12] an investor now. I'm a runner now. I'm a marketer now. I'm a whatever. Insert the thing that you

[11:17] help someone, I'm healthy now. I'm a fitness person now. You have these transitions where someone's

[11:22] steps into a new identity. And then there's all the other behaviors and other products that go

[11:26] along with that identity. And so we want to explain that and enable our customers to buy those

[11:33] things from us the moment they make that decision. Because it actually is more congruent with

[11:39] what you set in the expectations. If I said, Ham and how do you come marathon runner? And then

[11:43] I only have shoes to sell them. Then I probably didn't really believe that much in the fact that they

[11:48] really become a marathon runner. So they now believe you. You've sold them on this dream. This new

[11:53] identity that they could get into. Back it up. So we've already made some massive improvements to this

[11:58] onboarding process. But what's the last thing we did? Well, before this, there was no next steps.

[12:02] We were like, signara, hope you buy again in the future. And if not, you're dead to us. Not really.

[12:07] I say that to exaggerate. But there's three things we did to improve this last part. So the first thing

[12:12] we did, who is we gave them a summary of the experience. And we let them know in the beginning,

[12:17] hey, don't worry. You don't have to take notes. We're taking notes for you. And we're going to

[12:21] send them to you at the end of this call. That way you can be fully present and paying attention.

[12:25] And that way you can think about the questions you could that you want to ask while I'm here,

[12:28] rather than being worried of like, oh, I didn't get that. So number one, put to the midies.

[12:32] Two, they're going to get all the best notes because we're going to take notes for them. The second

[12:37] thing is we gave them tutorials. And so it's a, hey, you are interested in these components of our

[12:42] software because not all customers want the same things from your service or your product. It's

[12:46] okay, you're especially interested in these three items. Cool. So what I'm going to do on top of

[12:51] walking you through right now is it's actually going to give you a link to these three tutorials

[12:55] in those notes that I send you. That way you can refer back to them without me necessarily having

[13:00] to click through it again, so that if you get stuck, you can just follow along. But it's specific

[13:04] to the things that that person said, clarify whether they're available, they're in the problem,

[13:08] in the beginning of the call that was aligned with their goal. The third thing we did was,

[13:12] okay, we've given you the notes, we're giving you the how-to's, and if for whatever reason,

[13:16] you have a problem, we'll give you a point of contact. So you've got a POC, you've got a point of

[13:20] contact that this person that I've been introduced you to live on the call. So you make face time,

[13:25] you understand who it is, and now from this point going forward. This is called a baton pass. And so

[13:29] if you think about this from a business, no one should ever fall into no man's land. So this is

[13:35] what we like to call BAMFAM. And I got this from Shoran Sarvatsa's a good friend of mine,

[13:40] which is BAMFAM is book-and-meating from a meeting. BAMFAM is a way of life. No customer should ever

[13:46] not be BAMFAM. They should always know when the next time they're going to talk to you is.

[13:50] Never get off a call being like, yeah, yeah, and then we'll coordinate the next thing.

[13:53] You're both there. Pull up your calendars. Pick the time. Get it done. Now, with BAMFAM,

[14:00] that means that the sales guy hints the baton over to the onboarding person. They know when they're

[14:04] going to be talking to them. Then the onboarding person, baton passes to the support person

[14:08] on the account rep. Who's going to be managing that account on the ongoing basis. And so at all times,

[14:13] notice three different people touched the account. But at no point did they have multiple points of

[14:18] contact. So we had multiple people who touched them, but in the beginning it sales rep John. And then

[14:24] next one it's onboarding Oli. And then it's account rep Alex. Right? And so every point that

[14:29] person knows who they're going to talk to until that person hands the baton to the next person.

[14:33] So the second bucket of problems was expectations. And so one thing people said was,

[14:38] this is way too techy. I thought it was going to be easier to use. The second thing is they said,

[14:44] I'm not getting enough support. I thought this was going to be handheld the whole time.

[14:48] When in fact, this is more of a DIY product. The third is, okay, even if I am techy enough,

[14:54] and I have enough support, I'm not getting the result that I wanted soon enough. It actually takes

[14:58] me much longer than I expected. Now, when we look at these three things, by the way, these are going

[15:03] to be very common complaints with any service. Me in reason. You think about the value equation

[15:08] I was stating earlier. If someone says it takes it's too techy, that means there's a lot of

[15:12] effort and sacrifice required, right, which is one of the four things. So they said, too much effort

[15:17] and sacrifice. When they say not enough support, it means they thought it was going to be

[15:22] easier. Meaning they're perceived likelihood of achievement was higher and then we got into reality.

[15:28] They're like, oh, my perceived likelihood is much lower because this looks hard. And so two of our

[15:33] four value drivers have already been eliminated. It's like, oh, no. And then finally, we've got

[15:38] this thing's taking longer. So we have our time to light. And so when we look at these three things,

[15:42] they actually are the inverse, they're the nightmare version of the unvalue equation. It takes too long.

[15:49] I now don't think I'm going to be able to be successful. And this thing is to take weight

[15:52] in which effort and sacrifice. So if these are the problems, how do we solve them? So we actually

[15:56] solve two of these problems with the same solution. And one of them we solve for the completely

[16:01] different solution. So one and three we did by rescripting the sales process overall. And so

[16:06] fundamentally, you could solve this problem in two ways. One is we could add more to the thing on

[16:10] the back, which cost money. And that's okay. Or we can simply set better expectations of front.

[16:16] And so when we listen to sales calls, we're like, oh, I could understand why someone would think

[16:20] this if he says it this way. Or I could understand why they would think it would be

[16:24] happened this fast, the way they set those expectations. And so we rescripted the sales process.

[16:29] And here's the thing, guess what? We solved the same amount. And so a lot of times when you're

[16:34] small business owner, you feel like you have to promise the moon. But the thing is is that sometimes

[16:37] when you promise the moon, it actually makes people doubt you more because they're like, I don't even

[16:41] believe you. And so sometimes when you actually lower expectations, you increase their perceived

[16:45] likelihood of achievement because they actually believe you now. They're like, okay, that seems

[16:48] realistic. And so it actually didn't change our clothes rates at all. And so sometimes you can

[16:53] reel your sales team back and still close the same amount by just being clear and honest and to be fair.

[16:59] I don't think the guys were trying to be dishonest. It was just we found out that the way they said

[17:02] some of these things gave an expectation that was different. And by just doing that, we solved two out of

[17:07] these three problems. So the third one was people saying not enough support. So of course we could

[17:11] add more support, which I'll get to something we did in a second. But what we did was we wanted to

[17:16] increase their perception of support. And the way we did that was we made it more available. So we

[17:21] already had support. We had a support team. But the thing is is that they were difficult to reach.

[17:25] So we did as we created a chat support, but we made it easily accessible within the software. And so

[17:30] rather than have to go outside in order to reach them, they could hit a bubble and then immediately

[17:34] be online chatting someone. Now remember, from the onboarding call, they also know specifically

[17:39] who they can reach out to as well. So this is two types of support. They have an account rep,

[17:42] design, assigned to them. And they have kind of general support to help them through daily

[17:47] little things that were coming up. And in your business, you'll probably have similar things. You have

[17:51] one person who's really responsible for the account. And then maybe a team of people who kind of

[17:55] field the general questions from day to day. And by doing this, we eliminated this perceived problem

[18:01] people had, even though we already had the solution. We just had to make it easier for them.

[18:04] And so if you want the two of one advanced business owner hat, what we actually have to find out

[18:09] is based on the chat bubble, what page in the software they were clicking for support,

[18:15] we're able to see which pages or what parts in the process of using the software, people were

[18:21] getting stuck. They were getting bottlenecked. And so this gave us huge insights in terms of our

[18:26] product roadmap to figure out, okay, these are the places we need to be putting more of our attention.

[18:31] So even if the engineering teams like man, I want to build this amazing thing. It's like

[18:34] we'll do 82% of our complaints are coming from this one point. So we need to clear up this page and

[18:40] make it easier for them to understand. So we don't have to keep doing this. And so on the product

[18:44] side we're able to practically solve it by making the pages here and reactively make it easier for

[18:49] them to get support even if it doesn't solve it. So let me give you one more cool little tidbit

[18:53] that we did, which I recommend across everything, not just on product, which is we lowered the

[18:58] average grade level of the language we used on the page. And so once we lowered the grade level

[19:03] of the language, more people understood it and were able to use it. And I'm telling you right now,

[19:08] if you're sending emails or you're writing ads or you're scripting a sales process or an onboarding

[19:13] process, run the script through a reading level greater. And it will tell you what grade the

[19:20] vocabulary using is based on. And so if you're talking to people at a six grade level or an eighth

[19:26] grade level, then guess what? 30% of people are automatically diving and understand what you're saying.

[19:32] And as crazy as this is, a huge slice of America doesn't even know how to read. This isn't

[19:36] about being high-brow and hotty. You're trying to help as many customers as you can. Their

[19:41] money is as good as anyone else's. And so if you want to immediately get improved conversion,

[19:46] improved experience, better expectations, lower refunds, just lower the grade level of the language

[19:52] you speak at. So to be clear, these are the problems. These were the solutions. Let's go on

[19:56] to problem number three. So the third big problem was actually how we were compensating our team.

[20:00] So the problem is we had misaligned incentives. So we had tons of people were incentivized to

[20:04] sell in the front end, but we had no one who was incentivized to keep people on the back end. So the

[20:09] first problem here, and this is a really big one that I see happened too often, is the sales team

[20:14] was field and customer support issues. And so let me be super clear, if you want to destroy your

[20:20] sales team and annihilate any kind of goodwill and morale on that team, have them talk to all the

[20:28] dissatisfied customers that they sold last week while they're trying to sell new customers on

[20:33] how great the product is today. Horrible decision. But that's exactly basically what happened

[20:38] because they didn't have a dedicated rep. And so the person they had actually spoken the

[20:41] long story with this is sales. And so they reached out to the person they knew that helped them

[20:45] do this so they could get help. These people aren't equipped to do it. Also, unfortunately,

[20:49] neither are they incentivized to. And so destroys their front end sales, destroys their conviction,

[20:53] and they also take some time on their calendars. And they're trying to be ethical good people,

[20:57] but at the same time, it's just outside of scope. The reason this is so important for the sales team is that

[21:01] the underlying tone of how someone talks to your prospect is going to be their conviction. Right?

[21:06] So it's a big term, but it just means like how they say the words, the pace that they say the

[21:11] words, where they emphasize, where they lean back. And so if you want to destroy conviction,

[21:17] you show them that the thing they're selling sucks. Because then they won't want to push,

[21:21] they want to ask for their questions because on some level, they're like, you know what,

[21:24] I don't even know if this person's going to get help with this. Now, every person here has had

[21:28] somebody you know in your life who had their life changed. Right? So if you've ever had somebody who,

[21:32] you know, became a Christian and then it was on fire for the Lord, you can feel the conviction that

[21:38] they have. Now, some of them don't have the skill of sales, but you can feel that they believe

[21:42] what they're selling, what they're talking about. And so if conviction is one of the strongest

[21:47] predictors of sales close rate, because of how you say the words on the script, then destroying that

[21:53] is surely the way to destroy sales. So the second issue here is that because we had Missile

[21:57] and Incentives, our CS team didn't try. So if someone reached out, they would maybe respond,

[22:03] maybe respond slowly, and they had no incentive to really get a hold of them. And the easiest

[22:08] way I can explain this is, imagine you have a kid or a parent or a family member or a friend

[22:14] who's in trouble and you need to reach them. Would you just shoot them a text and then be like,

[22:19] I guess I'll just figure it out. No, you would text them multiple times, you'd call them

[22:23] multiple times, you'd reach out to them on social media, you'd call their friends to see if you can

[22:28] get attached to them, you would actually try to get a hold of them, not just go through the motions.

[22:34] And so our CS team at the time wasn't trying. The third was that if they did somehow get in contact

[22:41] with the customer, because that customer was right there at that moment when the CS person responded

[22:46] and they'd hop on and call them, the call was unstructured. They had no script they were following,

[22:50] they had no process, they basically just said, what can I help you with? And then they would go from

[22:54] there, which is a terrible way to handle CS. And I want to give you a larger takeaway from this.

[22:59] So I'm leaking into number three here. Every conversation with a customer has a perfect way

[23:04] that that conversation could and should go. And so if you know that there are consistent

[23:08] conversations that are going to happen with your business, you know that there's a sales conversation,

[23:12] you know there's a lead nurture conversation, you know there's an onboarding conversation,

[23:15] guess what else there is? There's multiple CS or customer success conversations that are going

[23:19] to occur. Well, if we script all this stuff and then we don't script all this stuff, why do we think that

[23:25] this stuff would somehow be better than this stuff? And you're mind you're like, wait, but the problems

[23:28] they have are different on the back end. No, they're not. The same people we say, they're going to have

[23:33] different problems on the back end, are the same people we're like every sale is the same. Well,

[23:38] you can't have it both ways. Sure, well, they're only going to ask questions about timing,

[23:42] they're going to ask questions about decision maker, they're going to try and stall,

[23:45] they're going to try and say they don't have the money for it. Oh wait, these are all different

[23:49] things that someone's going to present with here. Well, over here they're going to say, oh, I don't

[23:54] know how to log in. Oh, I don't know how to just step one. Oh, I don't know how to just step two.

[23:58] Oh, this third thing broke. How do I fix it? They're going to have the same few things that 90

[24:03] percent of people are going to present with. And guess what we do? We script. So this is what we did

[24:08] to solve these three problems. So number one is instead of having no team and having the sales

[24:14] team field it, we created a dedicated escalations team. All right. So think about this is triage. So if you

[24:20] get hurt, the first thing you do when you go to the emergencies they have triage, they basically

[24:24] figure out how badly hurt you are and where you need to go. That's what the escalations team did.

[24:29] That was first thing. So just off doing that, close rate goes up, sales team more out stays high

[24:35] because now they also have someone they can just shuttle people over to if it comes to them.

[24:38] These people become the catch-all. The second thing is, okay, well, now that we have the escalations

[24:43] team, now we can align their incentives. We can create a commission structure so that we have

[24:48] real costs in the business for someone leaving. One is we have to give a refund or we have to give a

[24:52] charge record sucks, right? Or the bigger one that no one talks about is you just have a lower

[24:57] reputation. People buy and then tell other people not to buy. So you lose maybe no money on this sale.

[25:04] But you lose three customers you would have lost over here. So it's worse than a refund.

[25:09] You lost three times or five times the amount and guess what happens from these people?

[25:13] These people tell other people not to buy the thing. So sometimes not serving one customer can cost

[25:18] you tons and tons of money. So let me give you a little litmus test for this. If your ads or your

[25:24] method of getting customers was getting your customers at call it 10 to one in the beginning.

[25:28] And all of a sudden now you're getting customers at five to one or three to one and it's only been

[25:33] a year later. Your cost to a car customer should only go up with the increased cost of CPM,

[25:38] meaning the cost per impression. And so if CPM's got by 15% a year or whatever they go up by,

[25:43] then that's the amount that your cack should go up. Your cost to a car customer.

[25:47] Now the good news is that as a business owner you can't increase your LCD over time as well. And so

[25:53] you can combat that increasing cack with the corresponding increase in lifetime value. But if your

[25:58] cack has gone up double or triple in a short period of time, everyone wants to believe that they're

[26:04] so good to get referrals. But no one believes that they're bad enough to get anti referrals.

[26:08] And in a world of social media where everyone is more connected than ever, the reason that

[26:12] your ads are converting at half or one third what they did before is because those two thirds

[26:16] of customers that would have bought now won't because they know someone who told them you suck.

[26:21] And the big obvious one is that if someone's not satisfied, they're also not going to buy your next

[26:26] thing. So what we did was we added a 10 to 15% commission. Yes, real money on the back end for

[26:34] saving customers because if I have to pay $200 to save a $2,000 sale, then I would certainly rather have

[26:42] $1800 than zero. And so some of you guys get greedy on this, but it's like just do the math.

[26:49] And so we did the commission structures. We added the escalations team. And so what about the

[26:53] unstructured calls? You guessed it. We scripted it. And then you know what we did after we

[26:59] scripted it, we practiced the script. And so we said, hey, what happens if someone presents with

[27:04] problem number one? Same as what if someone says they have to talk to the spouse? What if someone

[27:09] says they don't have the card on them? What if someone says not now's not a good time? What if someone

[27:13] says you get the idea? You scripted it and you practice it. But now we have a dedicated team that

[27:19] has an incentive that's aligned and a scripted process that we know yields a consistent result

[27:24] and gets people unfucked in the situation. Now, remember I said that CS didn't try? We'll guess

[27:30] what the result of this commission incentive was. All of a sudden because they had an incentive,

[27:35] they were texting, they were emailing, they were calling three to five times. So now all of a sudden

[27:41] it's almost like they give a shit because they get paid to wild, I know, I'll be here all day.

[27:47] So let me give you the real breakdown of this. To get in contact with the customer,

[27:52] when they're escalator, they have some sort of issue that's presenting is the inverse of lead

[27:56] nurture. Now if you're thinking through this with your 201 advanced business owner cap,

[28:00] a business actually looks a lot like a bow tie. All right, so you've got lots of marketing that

[28:04] funnels into a sales process and you have a lead nurture process that leads into that. And then you

[28:08] have onboarding and then you go back out again. So let me explain what that looks like. If you work

[28:14] a lead a lot in the beginning and then less and less over time because they're less interested.

[28:19] So in the beginning you call three times a day and then three times a day tomorrow and then a week

[28:22] later you may be called once a day and then after that you call them once every two weeks just to follow

[28:26] up. It's actually the reverse with a customer. So you call them and reach out to them via email,

[28:34] SMS and call one time today. If they don't respond tomorrow, I'm reaching out twice. The next

[28:40] sandwiching out three times. We actually increase the amount of reach out attempts we have for the

[28:45] customer because the issue is clearly more and more escalated. Whereas with a lead, you decrease the

[28:51] amount that you reach out to them as time goes on. To fix the sales feeding issue, we created the team

[28:56] to align their incentives. We created the commission and then that created multi-lane reach out.

[29:01] That was repetitive and escalating over time. And when they did finally get in contact with them,

[29:05] we had a scripted process that we had trained it on so that they could execute the right

[29:10] conversation every time. So the result of bad onboarding getting fixed, bad expectations getting set,

[29:17] and misaligned incentives was the big result and then I'll give you the takeaways that you

[29:22] can immediately use in your business. So the result of all that work was three main things. This is the

[29:26] net change. One, we had a 61% reduction in cancellation. So people wanting to leave or refund or have

[29:33] some negative experience. The second is that 25% so one in four of the people who got on a support call

[29:39] an escalation call chose to ascend and actually buy a higher level of service. Meaning, you know what?

[29:45] I thought I was going to need just a little bit of hand holding. I actually want to have more

[29:49] and willing to pay for more help with that thing I just bought. And then three is that company

[29:54] wide because these implementations have across all facets of the company, 2.4x the overall

[30:03] and so obviously here with the escalations we got a piece here, we got a piece on the front,

[30:07] we got a piece on the side but the overall, I want to agree to all these changes together was a

[30:11] 2.4x increase. That was that 20 to 48% increase in ascensions. Almost half of customers who bought the

[30:17] first thing decided they actually wanted to buy an even better, more expensive version of

[30:21] thing with more professional services tacked on top. Now here's where this is extremely sexy.

[30:27] I only talked to you about the $2 million in the reductions. What I didn't include was all the extra

[30:34] money because most people don't even believe the numbers anyways but the extra money that we're able to

[30:39] make. And so the cool thing is that all of this drops straight to the bottom line because you've already

[30:45] paid the cost to acquire the customer and software has notoriously high gross margins, meaning

[30:50] someone buying another version or higher priced version of the software costs pennies versus

[30:56] how much we're charging for it. So here's the first five takeaways for you. One,

[31:01] there's always going to be a cost of change or something new and so whenever you're going to

[31:06] introduce something don't get discouraged from the initial stats that's just opportunity to improve.

[31:12] All right so whenever I see something like that like when we had these big numbers in the beginning

[31:16] and I was like oh man we're going to be able to crush this and make even more as soon as we

[31:19] crumb these things down because the thing is is the problems are known and the solutions are

[31:24] also known we just have to do them. All right so number one the cost of changes fixed. Number two

[31:29] if you don't track you don't care and so when I talk to businesses and I sometimes ask them like

[31:35] hey what are your customer success scores or what are your CSAT scores or what are your customer satisfaction

[31:40] or what are your NPS scores which is net promoter score they're like it's really good I think

[31:44] our refund rates love okay there's a big difference between people hating you so much that they

[31:48] asked for their money back and the massive amount of people who just don't like you but don't

[31:52] hate you enough to ask for back because it's inconvenient the amount of money is a cost enough to them

[31:57] or they just said screw it I'm just going to move on with my life until everyone I know that you

[32:00] suck and in the very beginning when I started asking prodding more around these questions we

[32:05] didn't have metrics around almost any of the stuff and so sometimes one of the easiest things to do

[32:09] is ignore problem by not tracking any of it but one of the most interesting things that I found

[32:14] across business and humans in general is that metrics can be an intervention into it of itself

[32:21] if I want someone to lose weight I don't even have to tell them anything to do besides weighing

[32:26] themselves every morning and when you do that you start to lose weight and so metrics and tracking

[32:32] itself can be a powerful intervention overall in any business for something that you want to improve

[32:38] and so if you're not even sure what to do to fix a problem the first step you can do is just track it

[32:43] number three is that you're never too big for good CS and so think about companies like

[32:48] Chick-fil-A they've got gazillions of employees and they still have an amazing customer experience

[32:52] think about companies like Amazon that sell gazillions of dollars a year of products now you think

[32:57] wait a second I've never been on the phone with customer support Amazon well I can tell you I have

[33:01] and it's good and it's fast and for company that size for them to be able to field the number of

[33:06] inquisums sure that they get per day is insane but they still don't think they're too good or too big

[33:11] to have an amazing customer experience number four a lot of entrepreneurs are very afraid of

[33:16] talking to unhappy customers but I promise you that is where the goal is and I continue to say this

[33:21] but Paul Graham from YC has said this before he says you can solve almost every business problem

[33:26] by talking to your customers more and so if you want to know what's going on with sales talks

[33:32] the people who just got sold if you want to know what's going with product they got where people

[33:36] are asking all the questions on your page just get on the phone sometimes ask people why didn't you buy

[33:41] on the phone and they will give you the gold you need to fix your sales process to fix your product

[33:46] to fix your onboarding so that they actually will in the future so get on the phone with people

[33:52] who hate you and by the way a lot of times if you just let them bend you just let them talk to you

[33:57] why don't we actually give you more money too and if one out of four customers buy something that's

[34:02] four or five times as expensive you actually recovered what hundred percent of the refunds or

[34:08] cancellations that you get think about this for a second if you have a thousand are thing and you sell a

[34:13] four thousand are things is your upsell if you get on the phone with four people and one of these

[34:18] people buys the four thousand are things that escalation to a sentient covered the loss from the other

[34:23] three so you can eliminate the revenue lost you have by simply seeing the conversation for what it is

[34:30] which is it's also a sale and as a side note unhappy customers will usually get on the phone

[34:34] so especially if you'll underserved the picker break on the cost for these is actually through the roof

[34:39] when we started reaching out the team was like oh wow like they pick up pretty fast because they

[34:43] gave you money and they want their value number five follow up is a double-edged sword so let me explain here

[34:49] if you sell low ticket lots of units of stuff those customers in general cannot be communicated

[34:57] with too much people love when they're in the low end to be talked to all the time

[35:02] the more affluent your customer the wealthier the more expensive the thing often time counterintuitively

[35:09] they don't want you to reach out to them they just wanted to work and so

[35:14] understanding what level of avatar you're selling to can help you understand how often you should reach

[35:21] out to those customers for example for me with a vendor I never want to talk to them I just want

[35:25] it to work now some people if they're spending that amount of money with you and it's a lot of

[35:30] money to them then they're going to want to talk to you all the time and if that's the nature of the

[35:34] customer you sell to then you have to do with that so let's talk magically about these other three

[35:39] six seven eight so the first is revenue retention now when I was starting out in business all I

[35:46] care about with sales and marketing which is getting more people in the front door what I thought

[35:50] it took to grow business was to just sell more of those people and that's only half true now let me tell

[35:56] you story of two different businesses let's say there's a business that sells 100 customers this year

[36:01] 200 customers next year 300 customers the third year and that business loses 100% of customers

[36:06] every year so that business is still tripled for years later this is two sells 100 customers this year

[36:13] 100 customers next year but they kept the first hundred so they have 200 customers and then 100

[36:18] customers the third year but they kept the hundred and the hundred so now they have 300 customers

[36:22] both of these companies are the same size at the end of year three but which company would you rather have

[36:28] this one because the thing is is that here you're keeping all your customers and unless you have a

[36:34] compounding vehicle within your business the only way to grow is to continue marketing some more

[36:39] but I promise you there's a cap to that there's a reason that people in the information

[36:44] direct response whatever space can't grow past a certain amount because they have basically the marketing

[36:50] of a 300 million dollar business but they're only doing 30 because they can only do 30 that year

[36:56] and lose everybody every single year and so I want to be clear it's valuable to understand how to

[37:00] acquire customers you have to learn how to do it especially when you're starting out but it's one

[37:05] of those double it stores where what it took you to get here and get started isn't what it takes

[37:09] to create a really big business and so in this business we get obsessed and me personally as an investor

[37:15] the number one thing I look at is how many customers last year are still paying you because I can

[37:19] build on that base if we're not keeping anyone then what's the point at adding gas to this fire we're

[37:24] just letting more people know we suck the next takeaway is around pilots and so you'll notice that we

[37:29] only did this with 15% of customers and so this was going to be a more expensive intervention right we

[37:35] went from one on twenty five to one on one so there's a huge amount of headcount that we're going to

[37:39] add for this but when we test we test with a very small slice to make sure that it's worth the

[37:45] investment and let's say that these numbers had only marginally improved then it'd be like all right

[37:50] now I wouldn't have said okay we shouldn't fix them I would say this isn't the way we fix them we thought

[37:54] we had hypothesis that it would work but we actually did probably but it didn't turn out the way we thought

[37:59] and so when you test you just test basically a guess that I think this will solve it and so if you

[38:04] think about this like the scientific method which you remember from six grade you have hypothesis

[38:08] then you figure out did we do the thing yes or no and did the thing we want to have happened happen

[38:14] and so if you never execute it you'll never know if your hypothesis is a true or not

[38:18] and so you have to have a good guess you have to actually do it and then you can still perfectly

[38:22] execute something and have it still not work but understanding the bet you're going to make

[38:26] and what is required which you can define ahead of time what are these stats need to look like for this

[38:31] to be a worth it deal and if it is then you roll it out in around revenue retention that cost

[38:37] that we just talked about by incurring these extra CS reps if I can employ somebody

[38:43] for 70,000 year or 100,000 year and then they can save me $2 million a year or 500,000 a year

[38:51] I'm still getting five to one back on the internal resource allocation and so the bigger

[38:57] to business gets the more you actually become more like an investor you have to think I have all these

[39:01] people I have all these resources I have all this money and I want to allocate these resources in

[39:05] a way that gets me the highest return within the business and so if you have something get you a five

[39:09] extra a 10x within the company you make that bet every time proactive CS so we want to be as fast

[39:16] or faster reaching out to customers as we are with leads and I want to tell you a little story

[39:21] that's not about this company but about a different company we have that might drive this home

[39:26] so we looked at our LTV across a huge slice of customers and it turned out the second highest

[39:32] LTV avatar we had was customers that we saw were not using the full extent of the suite of

[39:38] services we had and we proactively downgraded them we said hey it looks like you're only using

[39:44] three of the 10 things we do if you're only going to use these three we actually have a service level

[39:48] that's half of what you're currently paying and you get the same stuff and here's the crazy thing

[39:53] when you do a proactive downgrad where it's actually still completely meeting their expectations

[39:59] those people never cancel they're like the place is awesome they were ethical about it they

[40:04] reached out to me they helped me save money like I love these guys and as business owners were

[40:08] afraid to do that but if that person cancels in two months versus staying for 10 it's worth way more

[40:14] not to mention the compounding word of mouth the referrals and all the other benefits testimonials

[40:18] that we can get down the road from that customer from being run like a good business and so

[40:23] if you treat the customers as important as you do your leads you'll probably be in really good shape

[40:28] and hey this is all customer success stuff this is all getting people to like you more and

[40:32] spend more money with you but if you need to do more marketing let me show you a case study

[40:36] day for one of our preferred companies where we doubled it in 60 days

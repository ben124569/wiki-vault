[00:00] What's going on everyone really pumped to tell you

[00:02] one of my strongest and most powerful tactics in persuasion

[00:07] that allows you to use integrity to increase the trust in your prospects

[00:12] by owning all of your deficiencies with a single statement.

[00:16] All right? So many times, if you think about how you're selling someone,

[00:20] the degree to which they will buy is directly correlated with how much they trust you.

[00:25] Especially in a B2B scenario where if I said,

[00:27] hey, if every doll you give me, you'll make 10 back.

[00:31] If someone truly believed that that every single person would buy from me,

[00:35] right? Because there's no logical reason not to.

[00:37] So underpinning that is whether they believe me or not.

[00:40] And that could be within the context whether they believe in themselves,

[00:42] versus the system, versus the world, there's other subbelief there.

[00:45] But fundamentally, if those three things are aligned,

[00:47] and they truly believe in their core, then they're going to buy.

[00:50] Which is the same reason that when you have referral that gets on the phone with you,

[00:54] it's so easy to close them because the person who referred them has already

[00:58] imbued you with trust. They've already vouched for you.

[01:01] And so the person comes in with sky-high trust and really just,

[01:04] you just need to get out of their way so they can make the purchase.

[01:07] And so I learned this tactic from Eminem in 8 Mile.

[01:11] And you can see it at work and I'll give you a couple of prominent examples.

[01:15] But it's using the word but, all right?

[01:18] And this is the concept of damaging admission, which is probably my single favorite

[01:23] technique to use in persuasion because it allows me to be even more honest than I otherwise would be.

[01:30] And in a world of like charlatans where people are always making huge promises

[01:35] and making huge claims and never kind of being real and authentic with people,

[01:39] you stick out like a sore thumb in a good way, right?

[01:42] And so let me give you a statement really quickly.

[01:45] And then we're going to show you how to reverse it in order to make it more persuasive.

[01:49] So let's say I said, I'm going to make you, you're going to make a ton of money if you work with me,

[01:57] but it's going to be a ton of work. There's going to be hundreds of hours of videos you're going to have to go through.

[02:03] There's five hours a day that you're going to have to spend,

[02:08] to execute each of the things that I'm going to tell you to do.

[02:12] What happens is in that statement, I directed your attention to all of the things that you're going to have to do.

[02:19] Now, if you noticed, it was positive statement, but negative statement.

[02:24] Now, if you reverse these things and go negative statement, but positive statement, the

[02:30] butt axis and amplifier for the second half, let's try it on. Listen, if you sign out for Jim launch or you

[02:37] sign up to work with me, you're going to have to go through hundreds of hours of videos, you're going to have to take

[02:41] five hours a day to work and do these things. But you're going to make more money than you ever made your life.

[02:48] The thing is that butt and then the statement, when I say something negative, I was on a deep

[02:53] for example, and I was trying to persuade you on the lady back in the day before I was married,

[02:58] I might say something like listen. Sometimes I have a temper. I can be short at times.

[03:06] I don't have a ton of time to get dedicated to a relationship right now because my business is taking

[03:11] a majority of my time, but I'm absolutely fantastic. Right. If I said something like that,

[03:18] the thing is that the more negatives I can say in the beginning, the more believable,

[03:22] the thing that I say right afterwards is. Right. And so if I own all of my negatives, which is why I

[03:27] love this, because be truthful in the things that you're saying that are negative and the more true they are

[03:34] and the more damaging they are, the more believable the thing that comes after the sentence.

[03:40] And so the way to use butt because everything that happens here after the word butt is amplified.

[03:50] And everything that is before the word butt is diminished. So the good thing is you can actually

[03:59] control where your prospect's attention is going. So this is where we're directing them.

[04:05] It's after the word butt. And so I do this sometimes, you know, the word because it's actually

[04:10] really similar to to this in a different way. I'll use it in another video. But if I say something really

[04:18] horrible, I'm trying to think of something else. Let's see here. I'm really hard to live with.

[04:29] I absolutely do know how it's chores, whatever. But whatever I say right now is something that you're

[04:34] going to believe. Right? And so when you use this to your advantage and you weave this into your

[04:41] copy, especially as you get closer to your call to actions, people will believe you. And fundamentally

[04:48] this is what will make your copy so much more persuasive. Right? Like for example, Jim Watch has tons of

[04:53] one star reviews. We also have, but we also have thousands of five stars. Right? And so the question is whether

[05:01] you want to eat at a restaurant that has 4.7 stars with 3,000 ratings or you want to eat at a

[05:07] place that has five stars with 19. Right? I would rather eat the 4.7 star. Same thing with you

[05:13] by on Amazon. Right? Because the damaging admissions, the reviews that are negative give

[05:17] credence to the things that are positive. So let me give you a really famous example that Viagra

[05:22] had and some of you guys may know this commercial, but it's literally it crushed for them. Right?

[05:29] Some of you guys may remember that they had a warning label at the end of their

[05:32] advertisements that said, if an election last longer than four hours, you know, must contact

[05:38] a medical, you know, professional. Right? And so the beauty is there was a genuine risk, right?

[05:45] But in making the risk, they amplified the power of the product. Every single guy heard that

[05:50] warning and was like, I could have an erection for four hours, like, sign me up, right? And so it would

[05:55] be like the same thing as saying, like, you know, warning, you know, when you sign up, it's

[06:01] start working with Jim Lach, you're going to massively increase your tax burden. All right? So like,

[06:05] like, we are not liable for the amount of taxes that you're going to have to pay as resolved

[06:08] the amount of money we're going to make. Right? So it's the negative consequence of the positive

[06:13] that amplifies the believability of the statement. If we're warning people that the extreme

[06:19] adverse effects of the of the of the of the result that we're promising in an extreme fashion,

[06:24] then it makes the the underlying believability of whether or not they're going to achieve it,

[06:29] seem assumed, right? And then it makes the entire set of of sentences or the preceding argument

[06:38] more persuasive, right? And believable. And so ultimately, this is one of my favorite persuasion tactics,

[06:45] and I love it because it's so based in integrity, right? You're just saying all of the things

[06:50] that someone is going to find out eventually, you might as well use those things to increase the

[06:55] persuasiveness of your argument, right? And so I wanted to leave this with you. I hope you find it valuable,

[07:01] keeping awesome, try it in your copy, try it when you're presenting something in a sales

[07:04] presentation and I guarantee you you will have a prospect you believe you much more is more

[07:09] likely likely to buy. So lots of love and I'll catch you on the flip side. Bye!

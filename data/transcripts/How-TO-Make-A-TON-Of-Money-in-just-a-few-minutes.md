[00:00] Everybody's watching this video, I'm about to make you a ton of money in a few minutes.

[00:03] I'm gonna walk down exactly how you can price stuff to get more people to buy really expensive things that you sell.

[00:09] And if you don't sell something really expensive, you're gonna want to buy the end of this video.

[00:12] Right now, if you can write down on a piece of paper what the average price of the thing that you sell is.

[00:16] Let's say it's a hundred bucks.

[00:17] But I want you to do is I want you to put 10x, I want you to put 50x, I want you to put 100x next to it.

[00:22] Now, I want you to write the price of what that would be.

[00:24] If the main thing's a hundred bucks, 10x is a thousand.

[00:26] 50x is 5,000.

[00:27] A hundredx is 10,000.

[00:29] It doesn't matter what business you have.

[00:30] If you want to make lots of money, sell more expensive stuff.

[00:34] There's no strategic benefit to being the second cheapest person marketplace.

[00:37] But there is for being the most expensive.

[00:38] There's only one strategic benefit to being the lowest cost person in the marketplace.

[00:42] Which means that you went in with that strategy and you built an entire business around operational efficiency automation.

[00:47] And you built the whole strategy to the business on being able to provide the same thing for less.

[00:52] If you did not do that and are simply trying to do the same business as other people and compete on price, you will lose.

[00:57] You will have no profit left over and you will get priced at the point of break even and you will just run a nonprofit.

[01:01] Thank you.

[01:02] That's probably not why you got into business.

[01:03] No matter what you sell, you should have something that's 10, 50, 100x more expensive than thing you're currently selling.

[01:08] When I bought my first nice suit for myself, a friend of mine was like fashionable and he took me to the store or whatever.

[01:15] I put a suit on it.

[01:16] I remember checking the price tag and it was $13,000.

[01:18] Home he didn't have $13,000.

[01:19] When I was like fuck.

[01:20] And then what they did is after I took that off, they put me in a suit that was like 2900 bucks or 2500 dollars.

[01:25] And I was like okay, I can get with this right?

[01:28] I didn't realize it then but they had completely priced anchored me and that was 100% the strategy was to put you in the most expensive suit and then you're like,

[01:34] Jeez.

[01:35] But the thing is that some guys will look at that and the right guy will be like, done, I'm in.

[01:39] Price anchors have two benefits and this isn't the only point of the video.

[01:42] The first point for everybody who isn't going to buy the really expensive 10x, 50x, 100x thing.

[01:47] You anchor the rest of your pricing against that first price.

[01:50] So you're showing them the things kind of like ripping off the band.

[01:52] It's like stretching the length through which they see your pricing.

[01:55] If I say $1,000 first and then I say $100,000, it's like, fuck.

[02:00] That's huge.

[02:01] But if I say $1,000 first and then I say $100 or $10,000, that sounds like less.

[02:07] If you have a pricing menu for a membership for example of any kind, you want to have the most expensive one first, not the least expensive one.

[02:14] And then everything else will look cheaper by comparison.

[02:17] So if you have a membership for a membership for a membership, it works in every situation because it works on psychology.

[02:21] Now let's talk about the other side of the equation.

[02:23] So we've got the anchor and then we've got other options of pricing.

[02:26] So how do we organize the other two options?

[02:28] Good question.

[02:29] I like to use the small medium large example to kind of break this down.

[02:32] So you can use this as small medium large pot for small medium large cooks, whatever.

[02:35] But let's say you've got 10 bucks, five bucks and you've got this middle price.

[02:38] Where you put this middle price will indicate which product gets sold the most of.

[02:42] A certain percentage people always buy the cheapest thing because that's who they are and that's fine.

[02:45] The next people are influenced by the pricing in general.

[02:48] So if I have a $5 thing and a $10 thing, I can make this medium six bucks.

[02:53] So I make my medium a dollar more than my small and it seems like a great price.

[02:57] But the thing is that every forgets is that we make up all the prices.

[03:00] All of these are made up.

[03:01] So we've got five 10 and we've got six or six 50 or six 99.

[03:04] And we're going to get a lot of people are going to buy this one.

[03:06] Now if I bump this to here, nine dollars, I make this 10, what are people going to do?

[03:11] A lot of people are going to buy this one because by comparison, it's like, we just for a dollar more.

[03:14] I get twice of the small, well that sounds like a great deal.

[03:17] And so fundamentally, people want to buy great deals.

[03:19] They don't want to buy cheap stuff.

[03:20] Think about the difference there.

[03:22] Prices, what you pay values, what you get.

[03:23] The deal is the discrepancy between the two.

[03:25] For example, and this is a big one.

[03:27] This is a, I want to break this belief for you.

[03:28] If right now, you sell expensive stuff.

[03:30] $5,000 things or $10,000 things.

[03:32] If I were giving you a Ferrari brand new and I said, it's 10 grand and I'm walking up the people in the street.

[03:39] And they believe that I was actually going to give them the Ferrari.

[03:43] How hard do you think it would be for them to come up with 10 grand?

[03:45] What would they do?

[03:46] They would call their friends, they would call their family, they would take out of the credit cards, they would take a loan, why?

[03:51] Because they know it's worth more than 10 grand.

[03:53] Whenever you are selling something expensive, the reason someone is not buying it is simply because they do not understand the value.

[03:59] Because if they understand the value and they believe that you're giving them a Ferrari, they will find a way to get the money.

[04:05] I want to banish this whole concept of like, they can't afford it.

[04:08] Everyone can afford it if they believe the value is there.

[04:11] And so the idea is not that we're giving cheap stuff away.

[04:13] We want the value relative to the price to be a huge bargain.

[04:17] When you're coming up with the stuff that you're going to sell, the first thing that I want everybody to do.

[04:20] 10x50x100x, pick one and then figure out what you would have to fulfill to make it worth that.

[04:25] They are getting a Ferrari for 10 grand.

[04:27] And that's how you get people to say yes over an hour again.

[04:30] And the other thing is that it starts to teach you that people are willing to spend more when they see the value.

[04:35] Another benefit of having this huge price anchor is that whales will buy it.

[04:38] So a certain percentage of population, just like I said, a certain percentage population always buys the cheap thing because that's who they are.

[04:43] There's another percentage of population that always buys the most expensive things because that's who they are.

[04:46] It doesn't hurt you at all to have something super expensive on your menu.

[04:50] Put it there with the expectation that you're never going to sell.

[04:52] And be surprised when you do.

[04:54] If you didn't get a gas from the price, you didn't go high enough.

[04:57] You want that gas because that gas shows that you broken the rubber band of pricing that they associated with what they expected your product or service to be priced at.

[05:04] And so if you're like, oh, it's 100 grander.

[05:06] Whoa, I was not expecting that.

[05:08] You're like, oh, no worries.

[05:09] And then you can explain why it's worth it.

[05:10] But then it's like, you know what?

[05:12] I think we can do 80% of that for 10 because that's our silver.

[05:16] That makes more sense for you.

[05:17] Yeah, I would be because I don't sense for me.

[05:18] Now if silver's 10, bronze is 8 and gold is 100.

[05:22] You can sell a lot of 10k's.

[05:23] Because now it seems like nothing.

[05:24] It depends on the customer segmentation.

[05:26] But one of the big mistakes I see people do is that they'll have like a hundred-dollar month,

[05:30] a hundred-dollar month, a hundred-dollar month, and a hundred-dollar month.

[05:32] You want to meet buying personas.

[05:34] So you might have a hundred-dollar month.

[05:35] You might have a hundred-dollar month.

[05:36] You might have a thousand-dollar month because the people on the needs between those customers are different.

[05:40] So you want a price based on the value-deliver to a specific avatar.

[05:43] Like if I'm selling something to Coca-Cola,

[05:45] it's going to be more valuable to Coca-Cola than it is to a local brewery.

[05:49] So you can price it accordingly.

[05:50] If you are a CRO expert, conversion rate optimization,

[05:52] and you can help an e-commerce store by 10%

[05:55] if the store is making a million bucks a year, 10% is 100 grand.

[05:58] If the store is doing a hundred million dollars a year,

[06:01] 10% is 10 million.

[06:02] You literally can provide more value to them because of who they are,

[06:05] not because of who you are.

[06:07] So 10x, 50x, 100x.

[06:09] Think about what you'd provide for each of those levels.

[06:11] Put that at the top of your menu.

[06:12] The first thing that you was willing to people,

[06:14] expect one out of 20 to say yes to it.

[06:16] And for everybody else,

[06:17] to feel much more comfortable taking the other options.

[06:19] Bye!

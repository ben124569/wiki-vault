[00:00] So you want to make money online, but you don't want to feel it or sleazy to the people

[00:03] who know and love you when you ask them to give you money.

[00:05] So there's a good way to do it and there's a bad way to do it.

[00:09] The good news is I can show you step-by-step how I got my first 20 clients posting on social

[00:13] media for my personal training business a decade ago and have continued to use that in

[00:18] each company going forward.

[00:19] And this is a sneak preview from my upcoming book $100 million a lead, which you can

[00:22] check out at Aclusors.com for its Lashleys.

[00:25] So there was a friend of mine who had a podcast that blew up and very quickly hit millions

[00:29] of downloads and his business started to grow.

[00:32] It's skyrocketed and it was almost 100% from people who were listening to his podcast.

[00:36] And what happened was he made an ass during one of his podcast he made a lot of money.

[00:39] He thought when I'm making an ask, I make more money.

[00:42] And so what I'll do is I'll just make more asks.

[00:44] He learned the wrong lesson.

[00:45] And so he did make more asks and he then made a little bit more money and then he

[00:49] made me continue to make less and less and less until eventually his listenership dropped

[00:53] and dropped and dropped because he had lost the goodwill of his audience.

[00:57] The key point I'm going to talk about today is mastering the gift to ask ratio.

[01:00] How much to give versus how much to ask.

[01:03] Gary V. Pop Realized the whole concept, jab jab jab right hook, which is the idea of giving

[01:07] giving giving and then ask it, not take but ask.

[01:10] The good news is this ratio has been incredibly well studied.

[01:14] Why?

[01:15] Because the biggest media companies in the world want to be able to ask on their platforms

[01:21] as much as humanly possible without losing viewership, listenership, audience.

[01:26] On television, for every 47 minutes of content, there's 13 minutes of advertising.

[01:31] If you look on Facebook, every 4 posts there's one ad.

[01:34] It's almost like a 3 to 1 ratio between how many ads there are and how much content there

[01:38] is.

[01:39] What I want to do is give you my slight tweak on the give give give ask concept.

[01:44] Instead of give give give ask, I'd like to just change it to give until they ask you.

[01:51] And that's when you know your audience is ready for you to make an offer.

[01:56] And my personal preference here is actually to give in public and sell in private.

[02:00] Whenever you give, you deposit goodwill into the audience.

[02:03] If you give someone something first, they're far more likely to comply with your request

[02:06] later.

[02:07] When someone helps us, we feel indebted to them and we want to help them back.

[02:09] That's how society works.

[02:11] But with media, we can do that at scale.

[02:13] You can gain goodwill and provide value to millions of people at once, but then it all

[02:17] funnels back to one person.

[02:19] And that's why it's so powerful and it's free.

[02:21] When you do it that way, your brand consistently is reinforced publicly and you continue to

[02:25] grow and expand.

[02:27] It will force you to keep that content amazing so that you continue to reinforce your reputation.

[02:32] If you consistently give and give, then what happens is your audience compounds.

[02:37] And this is something that I didn't understand for a long time.

[02:38] The audience is the asset not the content you make.

[02:41] So when I make a video that it disappears in three days on my newsfeed, what that one

[02:45] piece of content is is it got me 300 more people to start seeing my stuff.

[02:49] And then they permanently enter the audience provided I don't ask too much too frequently.

[02:55] In the beginning, it'll be really small.

[02:57] And if you can hold off and you keep giving, you keep giving, you eventually never even

[03:01] have to ask publicly because instead of asking, you just start getting.

[03:05] Transparently, this is something that I've now personally experienced and I was like,

[03:08] I don't know, but you know what, I'll give it a shot.

[03:09] Let's just see if I can make a bunch of business content and see if that will attract

[03:13] one million five million ten million dollar profit per year businesses, not revenue, profit.

[03:18] So that can invest them and help them grow.

[03:19] And it turns out it did.

[03:21] Now there's two ways that asks work in content.

[03:24] And so what you think of your asks as commercials?

[03:27] You're interrupting your own content with a commercial about your stuff.

[03:30] An integrated approach would be like during the content like, hey, if you want to learn

[03:33] more about this stuff, go to hundred million dollar leads, what hundred lit all leads is

[03:36] coming out and there are eight methods that I talked about advertising.

[03:39] And by design, I'm using all eight to advertise this book.

[03:43] And at this point, you already have 200,000 people who have registered for the book launch

[03:47] live, which is on this day, Saturday, August 19.

[03:50] So that would be an example of an integration.

[03:52] It's natural.

[03:53] It comes up as you're talking and then you can point to it and you get back to what

[03:56] you're saying.

[03:57] Integrations work better for long form content books, videos, podcasts, blog posts.

[04:01] Those are all things that lend themselves to integrating in very small percentages of the

[04:05] total amount of time.

[04:06] It takes someone to consume something.

[04:07] For example, if I made an integration and I should

[04:09] start it with a minute about something valuable.

[04:12] And then I spend five minutes in the middle talking about my thing, you still need to keep

[04:15] the ratio of minimum three to one.

[04:18] Because remember, television's 13 minutes to 47, right?

[04:20] For a 60 minutes lot in terms of commercials.

[04:23] So that's the max.

[04:24] And so for me, I would rather be at like 98% give 2% ask.

[04:29] So if we looked at the total seconds of this video, the gift asked ratio is still super strong.

[04:33] And I'm not going to lose audience because of that ask.

[04:35] The other way is intermittent, which means in between things, intermittent is typically

[04:40] better for short form platforms.

[04:41] If you have 10 Instagram posts or 10 TikTok reels on the 11th one, you make one about your

[04:47] services that you offer.

[04:49] And then you go right back to the pre-programmed show.

[04:52] It's even harder because if you're doing multiple posts a day, I wouldn't do more than

[04:58] 3%.

[04:59] So once or twice a month, one post.

[05:02] That feels reasonable and you're not going to lose audience.

[05:04] And so fundamentally, the actual cost of the commercial is not money, but good will.

[05:08] How much of my audience am I losing by making this ask?

[05:11] I though, to be clear, I always want to underask my audience personally.

[05:15] So if you're new to making content, believe it or not, you've actually been providing

[05:19] value to certain people for an extended period of time.

[05:21] It's you actually do have a decent amount of good will.

[05:23] If you make your first post, what I would just call like a declaration of business, which is

[05:28] just saying like, hey, you know, you guys have maybe been following me for a while.

[05:31] You might know me, you might not from personal from college, from work from out of the bars.

[05:35] This is what I'm doing with my life now.

[05:37] And I would love to give you guys something for free that would benefit you.

[05:40] And if that sounds cool, awesome.

[05:41] If not, keep on going to go see more about this stuff.

[05:43] Very quick, very simple.

[05:45] And I was actually able to find my first public declaration of business, which is here.

[05:49] This is April 9th.

[05:50] I actually come in up on 10 years.

[05:52] I hit my decade in business.

[05:53] How about that?

[05:54] For those of you who know me, you know two things.

[05:55] One, I am terrible with all things technological.

[05:58] Still true.

[05:59] For example, I just heard about Spotify a few weeks ago.

[06:01] Seriously, too.

[06:02] I love training slash nutrition and fitness more than well a whole lot.

[06:06] So today is sort of special because it marks a day when my love of training vanquish

[06:09] to see me trying to use fancy words.

[06:10] Vanquish my fear of technology.

[06:12] What do I mean?

[06:13] For the better part of a year, I've been taking part in a free personal training project

[06:16] that I would give away free personal training to anyone who's willing to give 500

[06:20] $2,000 to a cause of their choice.

[06:22] Give value for extended period of time for a small group of people to prove that you know

[06:25] what you're doing so you can get testimonials.

[06:27] By the way, this way, they wouldn't have to be motivated by the same thing as me, but

[06:30] be motivated to give to their cause and benefit themselves.

[06:32] When I first introduced the idea, I was happily surprised that I met a positive board

[06:35] I received.

[06:36] So almost a year from my first client, I now have a website.

[06:40] Deformedly shows some of the transformation that I've gone under way using my programming

[06:44] and as a formal means of contacting me about signing up.

[06:46] I currently have a few slots open on my roster, so drop me a quick note if you're interested

[06:51] thanks so much.

[06:52] Take a second to check out some of these ridiculous transformations in record time.

[06:56] What I make this post a hint today, probably not.

[06:58] But I'm proud of the kid who did it because I had given value for free to people free

[07:03] because they didn't pay me.

[07:04] I had them pay someone else because I wanted them to value it.

[07:06] But making that first declaration of business post was actually how I got my first 20 paying

[07:10] customers.

[07:11] I got 20 people who message me because I had always been in shape and people had known

[07:16] me my whole life as a guy who was always obsessed with fitness.

[07:19] So it made sense that I would make that my next natural thing.

[07:22] And so you provided value to people for a long period of time.

[07:25] You can make your first post a light ask which is just declaration and asking for support.

[07:30] And then you can start the business.

[07:31] Now if you have no content after that point show them what you've been up to and then

[07:35] you can make your ask.

[07:36] I would encourage you to make that first post because I think it'll show it's possible

[07:38] and I think if I can get you that first win, it'll be far more likely to continue.

[07:42] And if you're wondering, well at what point do I fully write hook my audience and just

[07:46] drain it of goodwill?

[07:47] Real talk, part of the game is called leaving money on the table.

[07:51] So let me give you an example.

[07:52] That of a friend had a tequila business.

[07:55] That was pretty big.

[07:56] Big enough that the rock approached him.

[07:58] It's Wayne Johnson.

[08:00] And the rock said I would like two thirds of your business.

[08:04] And mind you when you did that that might have been a big ask.

[08:06] I don't know.

[08:07] They said no.

[08:08] Now fast forward years later the rocks started his own tequila brand which is now worth

[08:12] six billion.

[08:14] So they probably would have made out really well with that.

[08:17] But here's the thing.

[08:18] If the rock had done that deal at that time.

[08:21] You might have actually lost out on what he ultimately made with termana.

[08:25] And so that means if someone says hey Alex can you endorse my thing, if I say yes

[08:28] today, it's probably going to be a bad deal for me because in two years my audience would

[08:33] be significantly larger and so will yours.

[08:35] When you're thinking about these right hooks, there's a huge time component and the

[08:38] thing is that compounding gets crazy near the end.

[08:42] Every time you decide to make the right hook, if you hold it, it could be ten or

[08:46] hundred times bigger, twelve months, twenty four months later.

[08:49] Did you imagine if two years ago when I started making content and I just started getting

[08:53] early engagement, my YouTube videos and Instagram and people started DMing me they're like

[08:56] hey can you mention where which I don't do.

[08:57] If I'd said sure I'm going to do it, I would have stopped my growth curve and I would have

[09:02] just been just another dude.

[09:04] But by holding back and it takes a lot of self-discipline, self-control and patience, which

[09:09] by the way, if you want the definition for me, operationalizing patience is just figuring

[09:13] out what you do in the meantime.

[09:14] You don't actually wait, you just figure out what you do in the meantime.

[09:17] Because I am in the game of making money, my goal is to always have significantly less

[09:21] supply than I have to man.

[09:22] And I always want to keep that demand because that is the holy grail of what you want, which

[09:26] is far more people who want to do business with you than you have capacity to do so.

[09:32] The strongest driver of pricing power and profits is supplying demand.

[09:36] When we make content, what we're actually doing is artificially shifting the demand

[09:41] curve in our favor.

[09:42] And the other side of this is that if you are the business owner, you control supply.

[09:46] And so you can inflate your demand and at the same time cut your supply.

[09:51] And when you have that happen, price goes through the roof and so do your profits.

[09:55] I'm all about growing a spaside possible game, which means you got to give as much

[09:57] as you possibly can.

[09:58] Just keep giving and people will start coming to you.

[10:01] You'll start not even having to ask, you'll just start getting.

[10:04] And if you're going to ask, because you need to put food on the table, which I understand,

[10:07] for me, I would be way more than the 3-to-1 ratio of more like 10 times that would be like

[10:10] a 30-to-1 ratio of giving to asking.

[10:12] So I keep maximizing my growth and keep my brand compounding.

[10:17] While still making a little bit of money for me, because I know that long term, the more

[10:20] I hold back my ask, the bigger it will be.

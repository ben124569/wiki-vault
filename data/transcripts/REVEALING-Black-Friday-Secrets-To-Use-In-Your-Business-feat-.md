[00:00] Alright, we are here Blacks riding.

[00:02] I'm a special addition today with the men, the myth, the legend, Harley.

[00:07] We're president of Shopify.

[00:10] We're going to go over five to seven stores that are actually crushing it.

[00:14] Now here's the advantage that Harley has in a week and share that no one else can.

[00:17] The image is what's going on in every single store across the global in Shopify.

[00:22] So, he knows who's killing it by how much and what they're doing.

[00:25] And then we're going to highlight some of the things that they're doing specifically well.

[00:28] So that you can either apply these to your Shopify if you have a Shopify.

[00:32] So, we're just how you sell whatever it is that you sell.

[00:35] We're effectively turning on the camera for conversations and do that usually.

[00:39] Probably a bit of a right, like over text or phone calls or whatever.

[00:41] Like, check this out this is really cool.

[00:43] And so now we're just going to kind of go back to the Commodifier.

[00:46] Before we do that, we check this out.

[00:47] Let's go.

[00:48] So, Blacks finally set them on the weekend.

[00:51] They sort of super cool.

[00:52] We have really some source on Shopify.

[00:54] And so what we want to do is project in real time literally.

[00:57] Like, minutes and minute how things are going.

[01:00] And I think we have to keep the little brother here today.

[01:03] We're going to be on EST on Friday.

[01:05] But we're now at the 3.475 million dollars.

[01:08] It's almost every single minute.

[01:09] Minute.

[01:10] We're single minute.

[01:11] May not 20,000 hours per minute.

[01:14] And on the 30,000 week shoppers.

[01:16] What is the basing there?

[01:17] Okay.

[01:18] So, we're about to North America because of how to come across that.

[01:20] Yeah.

[01:21] Okay.

[01:22] So, what you're about to see is this North America right here.

[01:23] So, you see where the order is originated from where it's going to.

[01:26] There, you may also, there these little fireworks.

[01:29] Okay.

[01:30] So, this fireworks.

[01:31] Every one of those fireworks is a variety of entrepreneurs getting their very first set.

[01:34] Oh, that is a variety of what you're going to be creating.

[01:37] The common thread at what we're going to talk with today is that they are doing things

[01:40] that I think are, I don't know, it's incredibly effective.

[01:43] Well, let's kick this off with Jim Schrock.

[01:46] I was just texting no before this.

[01:48] Yeah.

[01:49] Yeah.

[01:50] He's there anything that is the best.

[01:52] Yeah.

[01:53] I think with Jim Schrock, because obviously we're going to look at the site.

[01:55] I'm about to break all the little details down.

[01:57] But there's also the things that they do prior to getting to the site, right?

[02:00] Which is, what is the brand context that this sets within?

[02:04] And so, I think Jim Schrock does such a good job of building the brand and giving and providing

[02:08] value and making positive associations with the right people, the right athletes at the

[02:12] right time that, what they give when they need to give.

[02:17] And they did like, Rex from mental health, like they give when they need to give.

[02:19] But when it's time to ask, they ask them to give me that.

[02:21] And so, Black Friday is the best time to ask and so let's dive into it.

[02:24] They also know their audience really, really well.

[02:26] So remember, there's a couple of things, let's start high leveling, we'll go into actual

[02:29] tactics.

[02:30] Yeah.

[02:31] High level.

[02:32] Jim Schrock is the quintessential online retailer.

[02:34] The Sorrowline, Ben Francis Sartsis, he's literally a pizza delivery guy in 2012, starts

[02:39] Jim Schrock.

[02:40] And they build this amazing online business.

[02:43] Is there online brand, predominantly?

[02:45] But actually right now, one of the most interesting things about them is they have a massive

[02:49] physical store of Puppa in New York City.

[02:52] So they are not necessarily staying with Macon finds in one particular channel.

[02:56] They're expanding well beyond that as well.

[02:58] So off-line presence is going well.

[02:59] Now, they will still do the majority of their sales.

[03:02] Right.

[03:03] So spec, haven't told you this, I suspect we'll be online, he doesn't matter.

[03:06] This idea of having a 12 week Puppa for the holidays is amazing.

[03:09] That's one.

[03:10] Second is, it's a 12 week holiday.

[03:12] It's not four days, it's 12 weeks.

[03:15] And so the fact that they're doing this three month Puppa, the holidays means not only

[03:19] they starting before the competition.

[03:21] They're also ending after the competition.

[03:23] Right.

[03:24] So they're expanding that's something that's really cool.

[03:26] They did this really cool social media campaign, which was sort of titled, like, quote,

[03:31] there will be signs.

[03:33] And no one knew what their will be signs meant.

[03:34] Well, what it meant was in all their advertising, they would actually be E.

[03:38] Syrex.

[03:39] These are the things that we said what they were doing.

[03:41] Now, it wasn't obvious.

[03:42] It was super obvious.

[03:43] But because Jim Schrock is so creative in their community and fans are so creative, their

[03:47] fans kind of understand something.

[03:49] So people started doing a deep dive into every marketing campaign and they actually convinced

[03:55] people to spend more time on the site to look at what is actually doing that.

[03:59] It's telling the superwoman people, like, I just want to watch the ads.

[04:02] They're actually getting their whole audience, the most engaged audience of Pay attention

[04:06] to it, but not only that, but also a content about their marketing.

[04:08] It's exactly right.

[04:09] Which then gives them this whole extra, you know, lift to their impressions.

[04:13] And so I thought that was really, really cool.

[04:15] So a couple of things.

[04:16] So I'm just doing that.

[04:17] What is it?

[04:18] A lot of mistakes that you really, really well.

[04:20] All right, cool.

[04:21] So let's start with the site.

[04:24] So what's the, if we're talking pure conditions, look, look at the site is effectively

[04:30] a giant coupon.

[04:31] Yeah.

[04:32] Now, one of the little, this is me getting soups.

[04:34] We're up to this.

[04:35] Yeah, so if we look here, there's a couple of things that I want to point out to my

[04:40] folks, which is number one is they talk about lowest prices on top sellers, which is nice,

[04:44] because number one, it's like, okay, we're not just doing it on the crap.

[04:47] We're doing it on the good stuff.

[04:48] All right, so it's point one.

[04:49] Number two is, now this is a little bit of, again, this is just tactics.

[04:54] Notice that it's with the code.

[04:55] And so I know this sounds like a small thing, but sometimes, basically, getting people

[04:59] to, I think you maintain the retail value from a brand perceptive perspective.

[05:03] And then only at the checkout people then realize the savings.

[05:07] And I think it feels different as it's closer to the purchase.

[05:11] Now that, I don't have a double blinds and see most of the tests to back and up, that's

[05:14] just me as a, well actually, like what I would suggest is that, in this case,

[05:18] in this particular case, they're being incredibly, like they're giving it to you in a silver

[05:21] platter.

[05:22] They're saying effectively go by right now.

[05:25] Yeah.

[05:26] Now traditionally, if you look at this site in three weeks from now, it's very slick.

[05:29] Oh, wow.

[05:30] Incredible imagery.

[05:31] Great product for topography.

[05:32] This is different.

[05:33] I don't know what, like this is a completely different thing that you've never seen

[05:35] before.

[05:36] I also want to point to me on also, look at the order on top.

[05:39] There's only three things in the top pair.

[05:42] Women's sale, men's sale, accessory sale.

[05:45] They don't have any of their other product categories.

[05:47] This is deliberately designed for this particular week.

[05:51] So if we're thinking about when you're making offers for whatever it is that you're selling,

[05:55] it's narrowing focuses, right?

[05:57] Our folk, folk side.

[05:59] Right?

[06:00] So we've seen them work?

[06:01] Yeah, folks side, folks side.

[06:03] So they did this experiment.

[06:04] There's 24 jars of gym and then six jars of gym with the supermarket and they have people

[06:08] try them out.

[06:09] And the 24 jars of gym had more people try them but less people buy.

[06:13] And then the six got way more buyers, like two or three times more buyers.

[06:16] And so the same thing happens is that we have to have folkies as entrepreneurs and say,

[06:19] okay, I'm going to have a disproportionate of attention.

[06:22] My customers are going to have their wallets out at this moment.

[06:25] What am I going to prioritize?

[06:27] Yeah.

[06:28] And I have been supermermented choice.

[06:29] Get people too much choice and they're going to get lost.

[06:31] So this I think is very, very effective because they are getting you bread crumbs leading

[06:35] you exactly to where they want you to go.

[06:37] So I'm saying, focus, product, sweet is another one.

[06:41] Yep.

[06:42] And the conversion, conversion coupon emphasis.

[06:49] All right.

[06:50] So there is one other thing that before we move on from them that I thought was interesting.

[06:52] So I was curious about why would they do a longer pop up.

[06:56] And one of the things that I think they did didn't tell me this, but I think there's the

[07:00] early stage of the pop up.

[07:01] Again, this was a holiday pop up that was three months in in in duration.

[07:05] Is I believe they figured it very quickly.

[07:06] What was going to be the hottest items pretty action season?

[07:09] Hmm.

[07:10] So I'm pretty tested.

[07:11] So I think that's the only my hypothesis.

[07:13] Very smart.

[07:14] I think the fact that they were able to get in in October first, they knew what we're

[07:18] going to sell at the end of November.

[07:21] No one else was able to do that.

[07:22] I think that type of, I don't know, like Chris, Chris, yeah.

[07:26] I think I think that is very effective.

[07:29] And I'm searching this in some marketing meeting or some media at that company.

[07:32] For even, and other companies, I said, why would Jim church with three months pop up

[07:36] for the holidays?

[07:37] And I think they were thinking of themselves creating it so much data, so much earlier.

[07:40] This is such a, so all businesses, I like, this big generalization, but like data is so powerful

[07:48] when it comes to weaponizing resources, right?

[07:51] And so for us, for example, I'll just completely different perspective.

[07:54] But like the content that we know performs the best tends to be when we look at past content

[07:59] that has done well.

[08:00] And then we combine just winners.

[08:02] And so it's like we create, you know, 4503s of content a week, we'll make one or two

[08:06] logs.

[08:07] And the longs do really well.

[08:08] But it's because we have 400 and 38 shots on goal that we say, okay, we're just going to take

[08:13] the top 20 of them.

[08:14] You don't have to make it in assumption, right?

[08:15] You can see right away.

[08:16] We know this, that's exactly right.

[08:17] It's just this is awesome.

[08:18] Those are the things that are for Jim Sharp that they work really well.

[08:20] All right, rock and roll.

[08:22] Let's move on to, let's see, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's

[08:26] go to bark box.

[08:27] See, you haven't seen it, let's rock.

[08:28] Okay.

[08:29] Okay, bark box.

[08:30] Okay, bark box.

[08:31] If you have a pet, you likely know, you want to, I'm into this guy, that's where you will

[08:36] recap.

[08:37] Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

[08:38] All right, bark box.

[08:39] This is like an, you know, an Alex size posted note is this is how I know.

[08:43] Let's get it.

[08:44] Okay, so bark box, if you don't know it, is this incredible, at food business, pet

[08:50] company.

[08:51] And one of the things that I think to do really, really well is that they have a deep

[08:55] understanding of the customer, not to somewhere from Jim Sharp.

[08:58] But one of the things they did was they actually created challenges to get discounts.

[09:03] So rather than simply give it the discount, they created these pet quizzes.

[09:07] They've even done this for a couple of weeks now.

[09:10] But it also created this interactive gamification.

[09:13] It wasn't simply, here's the coupon go by.

[09:16] And they have competition.

[09:17] I mean, there's a lot of, show me that there's a lot of other companies out there.

[09:20] And I think what I recently heard that bark box is winning is because it doesn't feel like

[09:24] a simple transaction.

[09:26] It feels like you're actually doing something a lot different.

[09:28] It's like customer, it's like more digital.

[09:30] That's right.

[09:31] And you're also challenging people to say like, if you do this, and you're also challenging

[09:33] and you do it well, you get this reward.

[09:36] Right, so it's almost path-loading.

[09:37] Yeah.

[09:38] And I think, put it down.

[09:40] Yeah.

[09:41] So I just, I think they did it really well.

[09:43] I also think the thing they did is they created a very personalized experience because

[09:47] one of the things they got from the quiz, they got a lot of great information about the customer.

[09:51] Notice, come and think what we're doing here.

[09:53] Side note.

[09:54] Yes.

[09:55] Oh, yeah, exactly.

[09:56] All these people are, they're retailers, I guess, primarily, but they are incredibly

[09:59] smart.

[10:01] Business innovators.

[10:02] They look at data.

[10:03] They're, they're, they're scientific about how they're on these promotions.

[10:06] And so here's a great idea because they did this challenge, basically, you've got this

[10:10] game of vacation piece of it.

[10:11] But you also, they were able to ingest a ton of data from their customers.

[10:14] So now, you know, but I didn't take the quiz, but I assume one of the quiz questions was

[10:19] an aim of your pet.

[10:20] Tell me about the age of your pet.

[10:22] Now you actually have a wonderful day.

[10:24] They're remarkable.

[10:25] They're going to be precise.

[10:26] Now you have this wonderful day to base.

[10:27] We're really good.

[10:28] Yeah.

[10:29] I'm sure.

[10:31] But I think this idea that like the best entrepreneurs play into the brands, the

[10:36] strengths of their brand, they're not trying to be at somewhat where to talk with

[10:40] butcher box, about beefies, art of box, they make them steak and maybe.

[10:43] Yeah.

[10:44] But they're not trying to be like a high-end meat company.

[10:47] They're just trying to be who they are.

[10:49] And I think they have a really good understanding of that.

[10:51] So low key personalistic experience that was delivered through this game of vacation.

[10:56] I think they did a really well in art.

[10:57] So they're phenomenal.

[10:58] And I'll talk about one really big one.

[11:01] So on Jim Schark, I didn't mention it, but he was there.

[11:05] They had a top banner.

[11:06] And so one of the best and most valuable pieces of real estate on any online story is

[11:12] going to be the top banner.

[11:13] And I think when I was scrolling this guy, there it is.

[11:16] Yeah.

[11:16] So you can see they have their top banner.

[11:18] And they're making it like that is especially on mobile, which you probably know the

[11:21] percentage of traffic.

[11:22] But a huge percentage of traffic.

[11:23] Right now, cross the internet more than for online retail, more than half the

[11:28] traffic is on mobile.

[11:30] Historically, the actual check-up was a lower than changing things like shopping.

[11:34] We got this like, I'm not, this is a shop of like, it's pretty short.

[11:38] Because even though you make browsing mobile device, you don't want to have to put in your

[11:41] credit card number on mobile device.

[11:42] Oh, I was annoying.

[11:43] But now it's a really check-up whether a shop pay or Apple, it makes much easier.

[11:47] So conversions have gone dramatically on a mobile device because of the accelerated check-up.

[11:51] Just great because that's where I love impressions.

[11:52] I'm sure it precise.

[11:53] So farbox also has this, but I want to double click into not actually double click.

[11:57] But like, let's zoom into the, they wanted to make it easy for first time buyers.

[12:04] And so they're going, you know, obviously they've all this marketing, they've all these

[12:07] people who are sharing stuff and get your first box for $7.

[12:10] Right?

[12:11] So they're going to do things for the repeat customers.

[12:13] They're going to take care of their distinct audience.

[12:15] But you have this opportunity where you have a disproportionate of eyeballs with new customers.

[12:19] And so if you can double down and make it crazy off or because you know what your LTV

[12:23] is on that customer, it's a great time to do it now.

[12:26] And paired with, and this is, again, we're going to mix and match stores here.

[12:29] But with Jim Starks in person emphasis, it's like, you can get this deep relationship.

[12:34] Now, they're approximating that by getting tons of information on them.

[12:38] But in the IRRL settings and your life, you also get this test for an, in a clothing store.

[12:43] Right?

[12:44] They're like, wow, and it becomes a totally different shopping experience because an identity

[12:47] shift and you say, you know, I'm a Jim Starks fan of Jim Starks athlete, whatever.

[12:50] And look, products that are on there, they are their top, I don't know.

[12:53] I can't really see.

[12:54] See, there's light, there's those are top four sound products, likely.

[12:57] Right?

[12:57] They're just making it obvious.

[12:59] Here's what we sell.

[13:00] Do you want these things?

[13:01] You can buy them right now.

[13:03] We have.

[13:04] So first time buyer incentives, and they did the same thing as Jim Starks, which is prioritize

[13:11] the buy box, right?

[13:12] They know what people want and they're making sure that it's clear and evident.

[13:16] And it's, look, it looks, it's time to look at the better says, bark Friday.

[13:21] That, what this page is created for today.

[13:24] It is black Friday.

[13:25] It is not like the weekend or holiday special.

[13:28] This is a deal for right now in hyper real time.

[13:31] And if you don't get it by midnight, you know, as I say in French, they feel you.

[13:35] Yeah, specific.

[13:36] Makes.

[13:37] So, you see.

[13:38] Yeah.

[13:39] But yeah.

[13:40] So banner urgency and first time offer prioritizing the best products using data to create

[13:47] deeper relationships for remarketing the future, people are going to have lower action thresholds.

[13:52] Now, so they're going to have, it's easier to get people to take that first step and give

[13:55] you a little bit more information.

[13:56] We've just something like that this morning as well, which is like, okay, we're going

[13:59] to make this big for advertising.

[14:00] We have our scaling roadmap that came out, but people had to fill out all this information

[14:04] for the business.

[14:05] Obviously, that's going to help Taylor the thing that we're going to give them.

[14:07] But they're also going to be used for more information and information.

[14:09] That's a great quick protocol because most people don't want to get information

[14:13] for free.

[14:14] But if I can give you information and return that information, you're going to give me a

[14:16] discount.

[14:17] You're going to give me money.

[14:18] It's a little per-time.

[14:19] I also bought an left corner of the screen.

[14:22] This is what they want.

[14:23] They want you to base it up for their subscription.

[14:25] So they like, you didn't like, yes, you can buy things.

[14:28] Alicart gifts are up there.

[14:29] But it's ultimately, they want a multi-month subscription from you and they're giving it

[14:33] instead of doing it on bark fright.

[14:35] Now, also, to bark back to hard path too, I'll find at least point earlier.

[14:40] Notice the top, there's only three or four things that they had there.

[14:44] I'm sure that their site probably has a more in-depth navigation.

[14:48] Of course.

[14:49] I mean, this is trend we're seeing right now, right?

[14:51] These sites are built for today.

[14:52] Yeah.

[14:53] Built for today.

[14:54] I mean, when you have, when you, when you, when you, when you, when you, when you,

[14:56] when you, when you, when you, when you, when you, when you, when you, when you, when you,

[14:57] you're literally built for black Friday.

[14:58] Yeah, because you, you might be able to do a month, like, thinking about the amount

[15:01] of work that you do for a month.

[15:03] If you can do that amount of sales in three days, then you should allocate the same amount

[15:07] of risk, this you should respect that time as an additional month that's right here.

[15:10] Yeah.

[15:11] Yeah.

[15:12] All right.

[15:13] So I'm saying, I mean, let's, like, you know, 12 hours ago Shopify, you know, if you look

[15:17] at that counter, when it first came live Thursday night, it was about $800,000 a minute.

[15:21] Yeah.

[15:22] Now it's three and a half million hours a minute.

[15:23] Like, this isn't just some random thing.

[15:29] with this.

[15:31] Rough 10?

[15:32] 15.

[15:33] 15?

[62:41] get these tradeoffs we're having the story and the emotional connections that are, is, is big time.

[62:45] Um, I like highlighting this, which is, if, if you had, when the going is good, make sure that you've got something

[62:50] where first time buyers know what to get. Now, mostly stores had like a keystone offer that they had either,

[62:56] it was line with their banner and even on the, on the bottom left for desktop, where it was just like, hey,

[63:00] this is that like, start here, go here, um, I love directing, I mean, every, every, everything that I put on my

[63:05] site says, start here, like, just, this is where you start. Yeah, I leave the bread come, flip, but we leave

[63:09] them down the road, you want the, the, the, the, them to take. Yeah. Yeah. So come with the, here, obviously,

[63:13] prioritize best products, making sure that you've urgency, the better, these are super, uh, super

[63:17] tactical things. And optimize for the day, it doesn't, not every day's black Friday, I get that,

[63:21] but there are particular days like, you know, like, New Year's is a day, Christmas is a day,

[63:25] boxy day, whatever it is that there are particular Halloween, there are particular days where you can

[63:30] simply just add a very simple new theme or skin your site to make it, make it so, it's so timely

[63:35] that you know, you need to check out right now because tomorrow, you know, it's going to be totally different.

[63:39] I can virtually guarantee you that if you put a seasonal wrapper, so in the offers book, the last

[63:44] chapter is about the wrapping paper, like, how do you change your offer on a consistent basis

[63:47] without changing your business, right? And so my, my theme here is become a fraternity party player,

[63:52] right? Like, if time gets as, it's too, pulled out, it's like, Kager, wisdom teeth, right? Like,

[63:56] you, it doesn't matter what the reason why is, just that you have a reason, wow. So they can

[64:00] have your promotion. And so it could be your daughter's birthday, it could be your anniversary of your

[64:04] wedding, it doesn't matter. As long as you say, hey, I'm celebrating my anniversary and because of

[64:09] that, everything that couples related, oh, and you can get that information through these challenges.

[64:14] Right, and that's why this is like a super high leverage. Oh, so next from this QVC,

[64:22] this is low five, low five, low five, high five, high five, and again. So, oh, this is what I like

[64:26] because of all of the year in the man, like, QVC, this is to me a story of creating the least

[64:31] amount of friction. Even though QVC has done something for decades, a particular way,

[64:36] new technology came out, they made it less like you get this concurrent video, you don't have

[64:40] to leave the video to buy, you can buy right then they're through a thumbnail. They are, if they

[64:44] can change their way after 50 years, because new technology made it easier, everyone else can do that.

[64:49] I think it's amazing. And so I'm just like, what's the fundamental of this? It's frictionless.

[64:54] Yeah, right? It's streamlined. It's, it's meeting the customer where they're at. And every single

[64:58] every business can take one step towards your customer. What is crazy is that when you take one step,

[65:03] it's an order of magnitude improvement in terms of conversions. Be kidding, beauty. I mean,

[65:07] this is like, you know, like, you don't have to compete with the biggest companies. If you want to,

[65:11] you can, but also, there's, like, some of these big companies, I kid you not, you're sitting up,

[65:16] you're watching this right now, they are scared of you. And so rather than you going ahead and

[65:21] competing with them, they got a big budget, some of them are worth competing with,

[65:25] and not competing with. You may actually create something amazing. They're going to love it.

[65:28] Maybe they can pay for your ad budget, and you just make, you made yourself less of a risk to them,

[65:33] and you can sell more part. And this is coming from somebody who's in these boardrooms,

[65:37] who's talking in these big brands. I want them to be like credibility by what kind of

[65:40] they're, this is real. The biggest brands on the planet are scared of not their exact competition.

[65:45] They're scared of two people in a garage. Yeah. There's going to be the next, but they're

[65:48] scared of just for on them. All right, so we got Burger King. So having the advent calendar,

[65:53] the promo calendar, can't believe in Burger King on here. That's the last thing. Yeah. And so,

[65:58] obviously, they were cheeky with their marketing. They're like, almost cool now, which we're like,

[66:01] I don't really like how they're like, I think they're almost cool. And using their advent calendar

[66:07] to test, I mean, this is this emphasis that we talked about, Jim Shark. I actually Burger King did it,

[66:12] but I think this is like, it's a, it's a, it's a multi-diff, right? Like, I love talking

[66:16] about like, how can I double-diff or triple-diff or quadruple-diff on a one-move that I make? And so,

[66:20] this gets lots of PR. It gets lots of earned media, it gets lots of shares, lots of people paying

[66:24] attention. It generates sales, it allows you to reward the most hardcore fans. And it allows you to

[66:30] collect data so that next year you have a huge advantage of your competition or at least what you

[66:34] would have done if you didn't have the data to sell more product. Yeah, love it. All right.

[66:39] And then, but you're about to mean, this is sort of, this is like, this is you. This is like,

[66:44] it is totally, it is all about giving, give more value, provide more value to them than you

[66:49] capture for yourselves and do that over and over again, to your readers say, now it's how

[66:53] fresh a share in this upside. But this idea of creating classes with no call to action, no sales

[66:58] pitch just, here's an amazing class, here's another amazing class, oh, by the way, this next class,

[67:03] if you want to buy, if you want to click, but simultaneously, here's a link to actually buy the

[67:07] ingredients, it just creates this different relate, it doesn't really bring soul to.

[67:13] I mean, this has been my entire marketing strategy. And so I'm, I'm super pivoted. It's

[67:17] and the thing that I will highlight and that I want to push back on because I can hear, I can hear

[67:21] the comments saying, well, must be nice, right? Well, how, how, how can they, I think it

[67:27] requires some of them? Yeah, right. So they can do that. But or this doesn't apply to my business

[67:32] as an accountant or this doesn't apply to my business as a whatever. Literally, so this is my,

[67:37] this is Alex's preset, my, my two cents on this, is that marketing and sales are one continuum

[67:43] first off. All right, so they're not like these two separate functions. Just because they're

[67:45] doing people do them does not mean that they actual psychological processes different. And as

[67:49] far as I'm concerned, all of that acquisition process is a process of education. And so all

[67:53] we're, so if we define education as a change of behavior with, under the same condition. So if

[67:59] same conditions, they behavior, someone has learned, we have educated. And so the point of marketing

[68:03] is to change the behavior into the same conditions of what we avoid out. And so if somebody

[68:07] comes in as a regular teaser and then all of a sudden finds out that these teams contains

[68:12] some things that aren't as good and these teams are much better and they digest better,

[68:15] they're more cognitive player, they're deeper taste, whatever. Then all of a sudden you, you move.

[68:20] You're like, oh, I'm no longer a normal T go or I'm actually, I kind of do like these higher

[68:25] words. You mentioned the countings, for example. I assume they're one of the, one of the greatest

[68:29] examples because the tax code changes fairly rapidly in most countries, even in the US, right?

[68:33] If you put it every time the tax code change, if you put it a 60 second video that says,

[68:38] here's everything you need to know about Section 87221, this new change, 36 seconds. And you do

[68:44] it again and again, if someone is looking for a new countings, though like who actually go to take

[68:48] advice from most? Oh yeah, if this person has YouTube, what's that these great 60 second videos?

[68:53] I'm going to say these available, or she's available. And she's obsessed with blonde too.

[68:56] That's right. Right. Like he's obsessed with the tax code and specifically, okay, so we're

[69:00] thinking about countings. So we're just, let's use this community overhead. So if this is,

[69:03] you're like, well, I'm not going to compete with PWC or EY or some of the big counting first.

[69:08] And so yeah, but all we got to do is beat up with plumbers. And even, by the, they are never

[69:13] EY, all this big firms, they're never going to be able to do a 60 second video that's organic like

[69:17] that's good. It'll have good dry and compliance and committees and all that, you can out compete

[69:22] them because you can go faster. It's amazing. And so with this, this is the black Friday wrap up

[69:28] from behind the scenes for the man, the legend, the president of Shopify Harley.

## Full Transcript
[00:00] On November 30th of 2022, the world changed forever.

[00:03] Artificial intelligence or AI became accessible to the public

[00:07] for free through a tool called CHATGPT.

[00:10] CHATGPT.

[00:11] Which stands for generative, pre-trained transformer.

[00:14] A robot you can talk to.

[00:16] But you can log on to and have a conversation with it.

[00:18] And it went from zero to a million users in five days

[00:21] which is the fastest any platform has gone to a million users.

[00:23] It took Facebook two years to Instagram two years to took Pinterest four months

[00:26] and it took Angry Birds 35 days.

[00:30] I think that it has the potential to unravel the very fabric

[00:33] of capitalism itself and what it means for us as individuals.

[00:37] And a little bit later in the video,

[00:38] I'm going to tell you how you can capitalize on this

[00:40] to 10x how much you make, rather than being afraid of it in the short term.

[00:43] And curling a bit of ball and putting your head in the sand

[00:46] and like hoping it goes away.

[00:47] It's here and it's only to get more dangerous and powerful.

[00:49] So there's five major areas that I think it's going to completely turn on its head.

[00:54] Number one is the nature of work itself.

[00:56] The second is how businesses operate.

[00:59] The third is the economy overall.

[01:01] The fourth is how we interrelate with one another on a romantic setting.

[01:05] How we choose mates, how we seduce, how we have sex, all of that stuff.

[01:09] And finally, the nature of life itself and how it actually

[01:12] extends to interplanetary life and whether or not aliens exist here on earth.

[01:16] I'm not a big woo, 10 hack eye.

[01:18] But I think if you actually think through the logic,

[01:19] there's some really alarming conclusions that you can come to.

[01:25] Hey guys, going to be the biggest shift in our lifetime.

[01:26] It is the equivalent, in my opinion, of the moon landing,

[01:29] except the only differences that they will actually change all of our lives,

[01:32] rather than just being a picture to say that we won the Cold War.

[01:34] Different than the internet, phone systems, television.

[01:37] Because what those did was they reshuffled the workforce.

[01:40] This has the ability to remove or eliminate the workforce altogether.

[01:44] Cryptocurrencies in general had the potential to overturn the financial institution.

[01:48] AI is the potential to overturn the human institution.

[01:52] I try to convince people to slow down, slow down AI.

[01:57] To regulate AI. I try it for years.

[02:00] Don't know who I am or you knew the channel.

[02:02] My name is Alchromozi and the founder of Actresses.com.

[02:04] We're a portfolio of companies that does over $200 million a year.

[02:06] And I make these videos so that you can use them and make lots and lots of money.

[02:10] And hopefully you become a company between $300 million and we can invest in your business

[02:13] and help you scale beyond that.

[02:14] So in order for us to productively talk about AI,

[02:17] to understand what the terms were actually talking about far.

[02:19] AI is a type of technology that helps machines or computers do things that normally need a human

[02:23] brain to do. So if learning solving problems, making decisions and understanding what we see

[02:27] or hear, the thing that made the release on November 30 so wild is that chat GPT democratized

[02:34] access to AI for the first time because it had an interface that we could all use.

[02:39] Chat. They created a massive language model that allowed it to understand our prompts and queries

[02:44] and be able to translate that into machines speak, get the answer and then re-challenged

[02:48] into the back to us in human speak. That is what made it so powerful because now all of us can

[02:53] use it. Right now chat GPT spits out words since it's his paragraphs articles and even

[02:57] entire books. It can write legal documents, it can write sail scripts, it can write video scripts.

[03:01] The list is literally endless. I asked the other data write a cold email to a plumbing company

[03:05] for marketing SEO services and it spitted out and then I said cool, make it funnier and shorter,

[03:10] spit out another version. And I said great, turn it into a tax message, did it,

[03:13] turn it into a tweet storm, did it? It's difficult to comprehend the extent of it because it's

[03:18] only really limited by our ability to ask the right questions. Which I'll get to later because it's

[03:22] going to be very important in terms of how you choose to use AI. That's just words as the output.

[03:27] But we understand other things. We can interpret images, we can interpret videos and we can

[03:31] interpret sounds. And the crazy thing is, is that AI can do that too. So open AI also runs

[03:36] Dali, which is an image engine generator. And so if I said hey, give me a guy, smoking a cigar,

[03:43] looking over a beach where there's a dragon. Now make it in Van Gogh painting style.

[03:53] Crazy. Now make me 10 versions of that. Now if you think about the nature of what a video is,

[03:58] back in the day it was used to be a flipbook they would take images and they would flip the pictures

[04:01] and then you'd have a video because we can't tell the difference at past certain speed. And so

[04:05] if it can make images then if it makes lots of images in a row it can make videos. But on top of that

[04:10] if it has the words and it can make the video it can also make the sounds and the very new

[04:14] feature those will merge. And the same degree the inputs being text or verbal will also merge.

[04:20] This is the reason Elon Musk has been such a big proponent of neural ink. He wants to take

[04:24] it a factor further rather than be limited by our ability to speak or ability to type. He wants

[04:29] it to be limited by our ability to think. Now that may sound like science fiction but it's already here.

[04:33] Many of us were alive during the first iPhone launch. Now we're on iPhone 14 or 15 or

[04:37] whatever it's on now. What we see today is our first version that we can see.

[04:41] ChatGPT 100 is going to be significantly more advanced and we'll be able to input an output

[04:46] on demand any of these things the way we want them. The next important milestone is when AI

[04:50] actually enters the physical world. Elon revealed the Tesla bot. The thing is is that

[04:54] that's what it is today. Again like the iPhone. In many machines generations which happen

[04:58] faster than human generations that will be able to look exactly like a human and it will definitely

[05:03] if you look at Boston Dynamics there's robots that actually function better than humans

[05:06] than have longer arms and are much stronger and can jump and don't need to sleep.

[05:10] It won't have sexual complaints blah blah blah. Once those machine generations happen on robotics

[05:15] and on the AI side will reach a point where they're super intelligence. In super intelligence

[05:20] is defined as where the AI itself is smarter than all humans put together. I think it takes

[05:24] like unique human arrogance to believe that AI came out super seed humans. At that point the

[05:31] world will change significantly. This is where access to the super intelligence will become the

[05:35] most valuable resource on planet Earth. For example if I were to say hey build me a trillion dollar

[05:40] company it could in real time write the code for the product write the scripts for the ads

[05:45] generate the videos for the ads directly interface with the media buying place the ads where it

[05:49] already knows where the targeted audience is push those targeted audience's eyes to landing pages

[05:53] that it had built with the scripts and videos that it had built and then transact all from a single prompt

[05:59] who determines who gets the access will be a really important question for the future. The second

[06:05] is what will govern the types of prompts and queries that we can ask it. So if we said how

[06:09] don't wipe out the entire human race for less than $100,000 we don't want it really answering

[06:14] questions like that. There's going to have to be some regulation around this because the thing is

[06:18] that's a lot of power. If we had a thousand times the rate of innovation it would be the same as

[06:23] having all innovations between the period of enlightenment and today happen next year. And so that

[06:28] is where the last step in the AI evolution which is the singularity. The singularity is a hypothetical

[06:34] future point in which technological progress and artificial intelligence will advance to the point

[06:39] where humanity will undergo a transformation beyond which it cannot be seen. The first truly intelligent

[06:45] machine will be the last invention that humanity needs to make. Many people postulate that that's the

[06:50] point where it will become either self-aware. It will start to make its own decisions and ignore us.

[06:54] Well it won't really want to kill us because it has no reason for the same reason that we don't want

[06:58] to kill ants but if we build a highway we destroy some ant-hills. So it's just going to do what

[07:02] it's going to do. Some robots will eat some jobs and some robots will kill humans. You've already

[07:07] seen that with self-driving cars. But when you look at the trend of the whole I think it's going to be

[07:11] incredibly positive for humanity. This is why Elon and Sam Alman and those guys are trying to

[07:16] align our goals of humanity with the goals of the AI. If the only really productive thought process

[07:22] we can have because we can sit here and be afraid but I don't think we're going to stop the technological

[07:27] progress. Even if they band it, knowing how the internet is and knowing how black cat coders

[07:31] etc are, I have a hard time believing that they will be able to stop it because the thing is this

[07:35] will be the equivalent of having the new nuclear bomb of this century for this millennia.

[07:41] If humanity collectively decides that creating digital super intelligence is the right move,

[07:46] then we should do so very, very carefully. This is the most important thing that we could

[07:53] do. That's all I'll apply in this guy stuff. Let's talk about day to day. Let's talk about business.

[07:59] So to frame this conversation, I think you have to watch this clip because it will make everything

[08:04] about the same extent. So this is from Google and this is from four years ago, their personal

[08:09] assistant AI and they haven't released this to the public, which is weird.

[08:14] I'll have something out there. Hi, I'm trying to look at the literature client. I'm looking for

[08:19] something on May 3rd. So I can be warm. First thing is Lisa. Okay perfect. So I will feel Lisa

[08:34] at 10 o'clock on May 3rd. Okay, three, three, three. Have a great day. That's the baseline. That was four

[08:40] years ago. Now imagine it was a sales call and we have sales AI. That's listened to 10 million sales

[08:47] calls. This is the types of things that these people say in these situations. I will say the same thing.

[08:51] And then it iterates and learns over and over again. The AI can live a million lifetimes in terms of

[08:55] the amount of volume it can turn through in process and learn from compared to a human. So the best sales

[09:00] guy is going to have this much experience compared to the best AI sales guy. And so if it can have

[09:06] those calls 24 hours a day in real time, to whatever prospect you want, you may even imagine a world

[09:11] where you ask the phone teller, hey, are you a human? And when they say no, I'm AI, you're relieved

[09:16] because you're like, thank God, I'm talking to the best version of this who can hit on my problem right now.

[09:19] So if you were to have asked people, what job do you think AI will replace first? Most people said

[09:23] first it will replace the low skill jobs, the physical labor, and then it will be the low skill

[09:27] white collar jobs, and then it will be the high skill white collar jobs like program, or some coders,

[09:31] and then finally maybe it will replace the creative jobs. But what's interesting is that it

[09:36] actually happened in the reverse order. If you're a copywriter, this has serious implications for

[09:40] you, a logo designer, this has serious implications for you. Customers service, 25 hours a day in real

[09:44] time immediate feedback. What happens to all the physicians? It becomes immediate and more accurate

[09:49] for us to have access to a medical AI from our homes, and it can see us because it can

[09:53] take to a digital life. If you're in finance, it will be able to take all of the raw data and

[09:57] re-align it and put into beautiful excel sheets, front of mine, has a father who's a medical

[10:02] malpractice attorney. He asked it to write an argument for why malpractice should not be

[10:06] kept in terms of how much a lawyer can make on a malpractice suit. And then it outlined an entire

[10:10] argument for why it should be uncapt. It happened to be almost identical to the argument he had

[10:15] after 40 years of experience. You see videos like this, you see all these people on YouTube,

[10:19] you see Instagram posts. Well, what if the AI reads every single Instagram post of all time

[10:23] and ranks them by highest performing and then merge that with video and defects, we will have

[10:29] pundits and influencers that don't exist. Imagine you could create the perfect celebrity,

[10:34] or the perfect spokesperson, or the perfect porn star. And with deep fakes, they can work

[10:40] 24 hours a day, say exactly what you want and what they say has the perfect tone. And me to just

[10:45] stimulate the shit out of our dopamine centers. And we're just going to be plugged in because it

[10:49] knows what we like better than we do. If you don't believe me, go to this person's not eggs that's

[10:54] dot com and just keep refreshing it and it will show you new people. Now, if you remember earlier

[10:59] a video is made of multiple images put together back to back to back. If it can make an image of

[11:04] real person, it can make many images of real people. If it can make many images of real people,

[11:08] it can make a video of a real person. And then we'll have questions of verification.

[11:12] Did President Biden say that? Did President Trump say that? Or is it a deep fake? The blue

[11:18] checkmark will take on an entirely new meaning in the very near future. Now, those are just a few

[11:22] few use cases. But anywhere humans are, it will disrupt. If you are connected to the AI,

[11:28] you can input faster and you can get information back faster because you're not limited by your

[11:31] digits. This will be the next order of magnitude in terms of output and value that individuals

[11:35] be able to create in the economy. I do think that there's a chance that capitalism as a system

[11:41] for society may be overturned. You're going to have a huge cost basis that's going to be eliminated.

[11:46] So things may get cheaper. But at the same time, the money that would have gone to those people

[11:49] that's going to go in the economy won't be there. The point is is that I think there will be significant

[11:52] changes to capitalism overall. Now, one of the nice things, Sam Altman, who's the CEO, they have

[11:56] actually been undergoing the largest UBI study. So universal basic income study as a result

[12:01] concurrently with this technology. So he knows what they're making. We're going to have an opportunity

[12:05] to push the reset button and think about the world we want. And I think universal basic income

[12:09] is one part of that. He knows the impact we're going to have. Now in the short term, we'll be

[12:13] able to harness this. And this is what I think will foster and at least in the short term,

[12:18] a golden age for humanity in terms of what we're going to be able to accomplish,

[12:21] significantly. I believe that we will be able to achieve nuclear fusion. Fusion is renewable,

[12:26] clean energy for everyone. When you reconstruct the energy infrastructure,

[12:30] upon which all of society is laid upon, it changes everything. And so in a very real way,

[12:35] this will be a more significant change or revolution in humanity, in my opinion, than the industrial

[12:41] revolution, which changed everything. But let's talk about a very different topic. Let's talk about

[12:46] romance. This is where my opinion gets a little bit scary. The bottom tier of society have a

[12:50] harder time getting mates. Girls or guys, imagine if we've studied a million tender conversations

[12:56] to get the first date. There'll be tools, probably called first date AI. That can AI from

[13:01] first convow all the way to the date getting set. So let's take it a step further. We have the

[13:04] phone version of this. And you can hear a voice that has been tuned to your preferences of the exact

[13:10] type of voice that you want to hear, that talks to you and listens to you, like the kind

[13:14] heart that they are and they don't care that you talk too much and you only talk for yourself.

[13:17] And when you say these weird things, they just let it go. Because we think we're more complicated

[13:20] in the yard. But we really just have inputs that are brain interprets from electrical signal

[13:24] and then assigns a meaning to. And once you know the inputs, you just hit the buttons.

[13:28] And that's what it will learn how to do. Now we fall in love with robots. Take it a step further.

[13:32] The Tesla bot. Five generations. Ten generations from now. Looks like a human. And now has that in the

[13:37] brain. What happens when the robot humans are more attractive, more loving, more caring,

[13:43] more considerate, and cheaper than the spouse? Before I explain how you can maximally use this to make

[13:50] the most money and live the best life in the short term, based in the skills that we have to

[13:54] today indulge me for one more moment because I think it's really profound and I think it's going

[13:58] to change the way you see the world. Let's talk about aliens. Talk a little bit off, Jamie.

[14:04] Joe Rogan and many people have talked about alien technology and like what if there was a UFO

[14:09] that was captured all that kind of stuff. So let's put a pin in that. Play this out with me.

[14:14] When humans want to explore the universe, what do we send first? We send Mars Robah. We send

[14:20] a robot. Right? Right. If aliens are further ahead of us, then it means that they probably have

[14:26] a eye. If they're going to send something, they would probably send a robot. Why? Because a robot

[14:30] doesn't need to eat, it can live for a very long time, and it can survive in a harsher different

[14:34] climates than biology can. On top of that, it can work on itself. Whereas biology cannot. So aliens

[14:39] might be here, but not necessarily in their physical form, looking their AI form. Because if we

[14:44] can create robots that perfectly clone humans, so can they. And that may be who they send,

[14:50] or what they send. To check out what we're doing. AI would be the perfect thing to send to

[14:54] another planet because up to this point when we send something, it takes five years for it to reach

[14:58] whatever planet it's on. And to buy the time it's there, it's really old technology. And so it

[15:02] makes sense that you want to send something that is completely adaptable and can rewrite its own code.

[15:06] Space exploration may be done. By AI, more than it is done by humans. Because this stuff

[15:12] are flesh, we're super easy to kill. But the AI can live super cold, super hot, no oxygen,

[15:17] lots of oxygen, it's good. And once we saw a fusion with it, it won't even need the sun.

[15:22] Which leads to one question about life itself. If we define death as the inability to receive

[15:27] inputs. So like when you die, you can't receive inputs anymore. And we define personality as the

[15:32] concomerate of our actions and behaviors as a result of our past experiences. Then if I were to

[15:36] upload my thoughts and behaviors and past experiences, how I talk, how I speak, how I think, etc.

[15:40] Into a cloud drive. And then it were able to pass the turning test. Everybody I know couldn't tell

[15:46] whether it was me or robot version of me. Then is it me? And if that thing can now go travel planets.

[15:52] Is it humans that are traveling to planets? Or is it an AI cyborg version of humans? I don't know.

[15:57] Interesting questions. And you're like, okay, Alex, you took me to romance robot wives and aliens.

[16:03] How I make more money today. So the first thing that I would ask is that you adopt the mentality

[16:08] that AI isn't here to replace me. It's here to supercharge me. Why do I say that? Because if you

[16:13] adopt the other one, you might as well just throw in the talent out. You have to embrace change. It's

[16:17] part of humanity. Technology moves we got to adapt. If AI can condense our inputs. So if I say,

[16:22] hey, go read this book to still it down and then give it to me, I can now read a book significantly faster.

[16:27] If I say, hey, AI, go someone I's all my email and all my stock messages. And predict what I'm going

[16:33] to say. And then all I need to do is validate it. I can do a day's with a work in a few minutes.

[16:37] I think of chatGbT and AI of the future as a filter through which we will perceive the world

[16:42] but in and out. Think of it as your home screen. You read everything through AI because it is

[16:46] already a stilled it down to the most important nuggets for you. Then in the output side, it makes

[16:50] predictions on what you would say normally and it continues to get training it better. And then it

[16:54] sends it. We can consume 10 times the information and produce 10 times the output which is 100 x

[16:59] increase. So that's level one. The next level is the expert level. And these are the people who are

[17:04] losing sleep over being like, oh my god, this thing can now do my job. If you're an expert,

[17:09] what used to take you 90% of your time, which is generating things, you now expand most of your time

[17:14] to using the machine to generate and then you spend your time doing QA and validating the information

[17:20] making tweaks. It's going to be a real way using these tools. You become more valuable to the

[17:25] companies that you work for or the clients that you serve. I'll leave you with this. This video

[17:30] was made entirely by AI and this is a deep fake. I'm just kidding, but someday it might be.

[00:00] One of our portfolio companies went from stock to $10 million per year in four months.

[00:05] And in this video, I'm going to walk you through the actual marketing and sales tactics we use

[00:09] so that you can apply those things to your business too.

[00:11] So one of the newer companies in our portfolio is to do about 570,000 per month.

[00:16] And they had plateaued their month after month after month for about six months.

[00:19] So let's start with marketing.

[00:22] So we had in this business a webinar based business.

[00:25] Meaning it's running ads to a video that the founder would get on and basically pitch a call

[00:34] to find out more.

[00:34] All right, so I'm going to give you current state.

[00:36] So our show rate for this webinar was 18%, which is really not good.

[00:40] You want it to be 25 or kind of higher.

[00:43] The schedule rate from the webinar, meaning people who book to then take a sales call,

[00:47] I actually don't have that number, but we did improve it.

[00:50] So I'll tell you what we ended up doing.

[00:52] And before we made these changes, we were getting 58 calls booked her webinar.

[00:57] All right, so that's where we started.

[00:59] So the problem starting with this was the show rate.

[01:03] So the issue is that we were only doing one time per week for the founder.

[01:06] So they only wanted to do kind of like one pitch per week.

[01:09] And the issue is that means that if somebody books on let's call it Monday,

[01:14] and she does the webinar on Sunday, then it means all of this time in between is where people

[01:18] could forget about it, get busy, fall off, and essentially just not drop even though we paid

[01:22] to get the opt-in.

[01:24] So we did four things to actually fix this.

[01:27] So number one is that we introduced a long email sequence.

[01:31] So we had nine emails that we went that went out.

[01:34] And these were, we just basically improved the email.

[01:36] So we simplified the language, we put it more benefit driven,

[01:41] and basically sold the reason they should attend, and we tried to hit it from different angles.

[01:45] So we tried to hit it from pain, we tried to hit from speed,

[01:47] we tried to hit it from ease, we tried to hit it from being stuck in plateaued,

[01:51] because the big thing that you always have to remember is that pain is what drives motivation.

[01:56] All right, that's what gets people to actually take action.

[01:59] The second thing we did is we added an SMS because if people are showing up,

[02:05] then you want to communicate in more places in more ways.

[02:07] And so some people like me specifically, I'm way more text responsive than I have email response.

[02:12] I rarely check my email, but I do check my texts.

[02:16] The next thing that we did on top of that was within the emails,

[02:19] we actually did some sort of behavior response.

[02:22] All right, so you're like, what the hell does that mean?

[02:24] And so behavior response means that if someone engages in any piece of content,

[02:28] they click, they open it, we then set them behind the scenes content.

[02:33] So think about this as exclusive or secret stuff that made it show that we saw what they were doing,

[02:40] which is also something every business wants, it's like, oh wow, this is pretty cool.

[02:43] I didn't know they could do something like this, just showing kind of some more sophistication in marketing.

[02:47] And then the fourth thing that we did was again with more places, more ways,

[02:52] we had voicemail messages that we sent out to them.

[02:55] And so that means that we covered people who like text, people like email, people like voicemail,

[02:59] and then we also had video essentially for people who took engagements.

[03:02] We had all four ways that people consume information that we added in prior to the webinar.

[03:07] And so one of the other things that you can do obviously besides pain is that you add in proof.

[03:11] And so you can alternate between proof and pain.

[03:13] But big picture is that you always want to use the value equation, which you've got dream,

[03:17] which is what's the big thing that they want to have happen?

[03:20] You've got risk. So you want to decrease the risk. This is where proof comes in.

[03:23] And you want to decrease the time. So that's speed.

[03:27] And you want to decrease the heart, right?

[03:29] Which is you want to make it easy. And so we want to show how easy it is, how fast it is, how risk

[03:33] free it is with proof. And we want to make sure that we're very accurately describing

[03:37] what they want to have happen.

[03:38] And if you especially have people who have, you know, your avatar doesn't respond to email

[03:43] because sometimes there are industries, you know, if you're in finance, a lot of people respond to emails,

[03:47] if you're in painters, and maybe blue color workers, you might have fewer responses to email. So that's okay.

[03:52] So instead it's like making sure that we have these multiple ways like tax for example,

[03:56] as a 95 to 99 percent of the rate. So people will get the message.

[03:59] And so obviously you don't want to abuse it. But having just a few strategically placed tax can

[04:03] massively increase the show up rate to things. And I would bet that if I had to put between all of these

[04:08] things, this would be the biggest one that had the increase in shop rates. And so because we had

[04:14] CTAs inside the email to get them to engage, we also long-term keep the health of our email

[04:19] account because it shows that we're not just spamming people. Instead, people are getting our emails,

[04:23] they're opening them, they're reading them, they're taking an action. All those increase the

[04:27] over a health of your email server and your deliverability. And so that way you can continue to

[04:31] get your email delivered. Rather than getting into the promo tabs, just get a little bit

[04:34] taxable. But you can do a second tab with an email, which is like, oh no, never checks the spam

[04:39] folder, essentially. The big reason that we have to do all this stuff is because no one remembers

[04:44] what they signed up for this morning, let alone five days ago. And so we do this because you have

[04:49] to remind them and don't worry about cool bothering people. Now, do you want to send five

[04:53] a day? No, that's probably not smart. But if you send one reminder a day between a certain time

[04:58] in an event, there's nothing wrong with that. And so the most important part of the sequence,

[05:02] I'll tell you right now, is 24 hours before. So you're thinking the night before,

[05:06] you have the morning of, which is AM, and then one hour prior. These are the three most

[05:11] important reminders that you want to send out. These are the ones that you definitely want to have

[05:14] as SMS. So you might be wondering, well, how much do we increase the shop or percentage? Well,

[05:18] we went from 18% to 24%, which means that this increase was a 33% increase right off the bat. And so

[05:27] one of the things that I think is one of the most underutilized ways to make a business for money.

[05:30] Like a lot of people obsess about close rates and we're going to talk about what we do with sales.

[05:34] But you can get a 33% increase in shop rates and have the same result as having a 33% increase

[05:40] in close rates. But getting 33% more people to shop is usually way easier and you're able to automate

[05:46] a lot of that to a great degree. So it's one time work that have permanent increases in revenue

[05:50] profit rather than having to consistently drill a team on how to close, which you absolutely should

[05:54] do. It just takes more work. So the next problem that we had was that people who are actually

[05:59] attending. So now we have our 24% of people who are showing up is that they weren't actually

[06:04] choosing to book a call. And so problem number two, no bookings, right? And so what we did is we

[06:11] solved a few things inside of how we structure the webinar to get way more people to shop and I'll

[06:15] show you just how many. So the first thing that we did is we actually looked at what was. And so I

[06:20] think people skipped this step. But like this is the real work. As you look at the webinar,

[06:25] you look at the attendance rates, you look at the dropoff points, you look at where their spike

[06:28] sitting gauge bent. Spikes and engaged were going to be the interest points. We're like, okay,

[06:31] this is something we should expand some of this stuff. And where you have huge dropoffs,

[06:35] then you're like, oh, we need to improve this. And so for us, we saw we were losing a ton of people

[06:39] right at the beginning of the webinar. And so we're like, okay, this is where we're going to put

[06:42] most of our attention, which by the way, if you're doing anything content sales, webinar or

[06:46] whatever, the first five minutes and even the first 60 seconds is where you should be obsessing.

[06:52] Even in a different company we have in our portfolio, which does a tremendous amount of

[06:55] greater volume than this particular company. We rescripted the first five minutes of

[07:00] presentation and got a 20% increase in close rates. Just redoing five minutes and it was on a

[07:06] three hour presentation. So based on the research, we did four things. The first thing we did is we

[07:10] scripted a faster intro. Basically, getting to the point much faster and being clearer about

[07:16] why they are here and what they're going to get from it. And so if you're like, well, what

[07:19] would that actually look like? Well, it actually follows the exact same format that we use

[07:24] for our content, which is proof promise plan. So proof is, hey, I help someone just like you

[07:31] and you want them to identify with the proof that you are showing so they can approximate, oh,

[07:36] this is just like me. The promise is clearly defining exactly what they're going to get both

[07:41] from the webinar and potentially after the webinar. And then the plan is to set expectations for

[07:46] how the next 60, 90, however many minutes your presentation is, so they know where they're going.

[07:51] And the key point here with all the faster intro stuff is you just want to get to the meet.

[07:55] When I look at a beginner sales call or beginner sales presentation or BSL video sales letter,

[08:00] oftentimes, people say, a minute, two minutes, just like me and are like trying to figure out what

[08:04] they're saying. And they don't know that they're losing like 40% of their audience in the first two

[08:08] minutes before they figure out what they're going to start saying. So get to the point. Number two is we

[08:14] mention live that this is live. So this was a live webinar they were doing. And the thing is is that

[08:20] we weren't actually showing it. So we're incurring the cost of being live. But we want to say the

[08:24] date, you want to say the time, you want to say the weather, you want to say any current events,

[08:29] right? These are all things that get indications that this is happening right now. And so for

[08:33] whatever reason, I don't know why this is. But when you do live stuff, it works better. No idea why

[08:39] I just knew that it works. And so we want to lean into the fact that it's actually happening. And so

[08:43] mind you, if you do an automated webinar or you do a video newsletter that's recorded, there's nothing wrong

[08:48] with that. Obviously it gives you scale because you can't do webinar every hour of every day.

[08:52] But in general, if you are struggling to make something automated convert better, I would recommend

[08:58] going live for a while and doing it more frequently. Life's you get the reps in get it tighter

[09:03] and get the benefit of just the magic of lifeness. So the next thing we did is we had to take away.

[09:09] All right. So you can only, you know, it's like the only guy, the girl wants at the bar is the guy who's

[09:14] not chasing them, whatever. And so there's two main things that we change tactically to make this a

[09:19] little bit more of a takeaway. So number one is that we were very clear about who our qualifications

[09:24] work. So we said, listen, we only sell people who are this, this or this. If you weren't below

[09:29] this or above this or adjacent to this, this is not for you. And so my clearly stating those things,

[09:34] we got to ward off the wrong people and magnetize the right people to be like, oh, this is actually

[09:39] just for me. The next thing we did was we put scarcity in play. All right. And so this is one of my

[09:44] favorite ways of ethically providing scarcity, which is saying we only have this many times to take

[09:49] calls or calls because I only have two guys on my team. I only have four guys on my team. So we only

[09:52] have this many slots. And so typically we will book out of slots within this period of time. And so if you

[09:59] say typically, then that does excuse you as long as more than half the time that does happen. Or

[10:04] oftentimes you can say that, you can preface it in that way, not an exact language that it happens

[10:09] often. Right. And then with the scarcity, you just say the actual constraint you have. And so I see this

[10:14] is one of the most underutilized scarcity strategies in existence. If you're an agency and you can only

[10:18] take on five customers because you couldn't take on a hundred anyways, then say you can only take on

[10:22] five customers. If you can only take 20 phone calls, then say you can only take 20. And if you know

[10:26] that there's the urgency component, which is it's first come for a serve, then say that. And so by

[10:30] doing the qualification and then adding the scarcity in a little bit of urgency around it's first come

[10:34] for a serve and we can only service so many that though that sounds simple, people don't do it,

[10:39] and yes, it does work. So the fourth thing is we, I would say this is scarcity on steroids.

[10:44] And you're like, wait, I thought you just did scarcity. Wow, we just put more scarcity. So we did a

[10:48] couple of things around this, but we added proof. All right. So one is this is theoretical, but as

[10:52] soon as people begin to take action, we want to show proof that they've done it. So the first thing

[10:57] that we did is we said, hey, as soon as you do book, let me know in the chat. And so let me know in the

[11:03] chat, then shows this proof that's happening in the chat that people are booking. All right. So that was

[11:09] the next thing we did is that by doing this, it creates an open loop. And so it's like, if you're on a sales

[11:15] call, say, hey, I'll wait here and then I'll make sure I can see it on my side. Then we did as we did call

[11:19] out. So it says, hey, I see that Rosie book. Hey, I see that John book. Hey, I see that Susan book, right?

[11:25] So we can say in real time, it creates this, this frenzy around booking. And the last thing that we did

[11:31] is that you actually want to call out the sold out times. Now, this is a little bit of language

[11:36] use here. But we say the words sold out because it again, it creates more buying behavior and

[11:40] pre-frames the sale. And so it's a, hey, Wednesday is sold out. Thursday is sold out. Friday is sold out.

[11:46] And so as the times are booking out, we want to show that even though we said, we have a hundred

[11:50] slots, we basically chuck it down again and say, oh, this day is sold. The morning is sold out. Like,

[11:55] if you're like getting worried about like, you're not even selling. Just say, hey, the morning on

[11:58] Wednesday's sold out. Up, the afternoon on Wednesday's sold out. Maybe you only have three slots,

[12:01] whatever. But you can still basically approximate some sort of mini urgency, mini scarcity by just

[12:07] saying what has been taken. And it's completely compliant because you're just staying the facts and

[12:11] telling the truth. And by the way, if you're a business owner and you are doing a million bucks a year

[12:15] and you are looking to scale. And either you're not scaling as fast as you want or you just feel like

[12:19] you're stuck, I get it either way. And these tactics are helping you out. If you want specific

[12:25] help on your specific business, we open updates at our headquarters sporadically to invite people out.

[12:31] And so if you want to see if we have availability and you want to see if you qualify,

[12:35] you can go to acquisition.com. My team will get on the phone. Worst case will try and set you up with

[12:40] something that could help you in the meantime. And best case, we see you at your in Vegas. And I'd love

[12:44] to meet you and help you grow. So those four tactics that I just outlined for you gave us a 33%

[12:53] increase in our booking rate from the webinar. So we got a 33% lift in people who are showing up

[12:58] in of the now greater amount of people. We got another 33% lift in increased number of people who

[13:04] then both calls. And so our total book calls went from 58 to survey says 102. So nearly a double.

[13:14] This was 77% increase in total book calls from the same aspect. And if we had only done that,

[13:21] that could have just absolutely demolished it for the business. We got to done nothing else.

[13:24] And we could have wrote enough of the sunset. But we wanted to make more. And so let's talk

[13:28] about sales now. So for the sales process, all we're really looking at here is close right now.

[13:34] Technically, you could have a drop off between the booking webinar and the show up on the sales

[13:39] call. That was not a constraint for this business. It had a super high show up rates. I didn't

[13:43] even lift it here because it wasn't worth doing. And it didn't change because we didn't really

[13:46] focus there because it wasn't the main thing. But we did have a low close rate once people are

[13:50] actually showing up to the sales call and so we focused there too. And so the close rate before this

[13:55] was 14%. So to be really clear, this is bad. You don't want to 14% close rate. That's tough.

[14:01] Especially after a webinar or some sort of long selling event. So we were just missing the ball here.

[14:06] And so we took some steps to fix it. And we chose to fix it in four ways. And so I'm going to

[14:11] start at the front and move backwards. So number one, the thing that we had was bad framing.

[14:16] All right. So a lot of people don't know is just like in the beginning of a video,

[14:19] proof from his plan. Right. What you say at the very beginning has a massive impact on what people

[14:26] end up doing at the end. And so most people do look at the end rather than looking at the beginning

[14:30] and how they got introduced to the sale to begin with. And so in the beginning, a lot of the team

[14:36] that they had was kind of wasting time trying to like build rapport like, how is your week going

[14:42] great? I know we've got limited time here. Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, like, new. We wanted to fix the

[14:47] fairing and get right to the point. So let me tell you what the bad intro was before this. So it was

[14:52] like, hey, how's it going? My name's So and so, how's your week going? Oh, cool. Great. I know we

[14:57] have limited time here. So you're ready to jump in. You know, do you have a pen and paper to take notes

[15:01] with? Right. Now that was the old way of doing it. And I think that's a fairly common way of doing it.

[15:06] But I tend to think that there's a better way to do it. And so that's what I'm going to share with you.

[15:10] And so we started with was, hey, my name's John. I'm here from this company. And I have a background

[15:15] in ABC, which is specific to whatever problem that you want to solve. I work closely with So and so

[15:20] edified person that you saw on the webinar. And I would love to know what resonated most with you.

[15:25] Now they're going to then answer. Now we're, we're reminding them of the value that they got on

[15:29] the webinar and kind of getting them back in that state where they took action. And we say great.

[15:33] So the real purpose of this call is to see if you qualify for our guarantee, not everyone does.

[15:39] And it's really based on these three factors. So if it's B to B, you'd be like business size,

[15:43] industry, and you're being the owner. Now fundamentally, you're going to be going through

[15:46] bands, which is budget authority need timing. And you want to use those as the qualifications for

[15:50] the guarantee. Now if you have guarantees, obviously this is sexy. Now instead of a guarantee,

[15:54] you can also say, hey, we want to make sure that you qualify for the bonus or hey, I want to make

[15:57] sure that you qualify for starting by this time. It doesn't really matter what it is. But the thing is

[16:01] is you're immediately taking it away and saying, hey, I'm not here to sell. I've here to first

[16:06] make sure that I can even give you something. And it automatically they're leaning in and they're like,

[16:10] oh, I want something that I'm not immediately having. So you're in the driver's seat,

[16:13] they're the ones who are on the other side hoping to earn your favor. And so then after that,

[16:17] you can clarify what it is. And to be clear, the bonus is x, y, z, or hey, to be clear, you know,

[16:21] our guarantee, we have to be strict. It's kind of like college admissions, whatever. And if you don't

[16:26] qualify, this is what we're going to set you up with and help you up. But if you do, then we'll start

[16:30] buying back some time and make you some more money. And we'll start x, y, and z being benefit that

[16:34] we originally promised on the weather. And so the big thing, and this is like, it's it's

[16:39] everywhere through the entire process from marketing, the sales, to customer success, all the way through

[16:45] is that you want to have congrutes. All right, as you want to have, you want to basically have the

[16:50] customer feel like you have this baton pass between every single step in the business. And so from the

[16:56] ad to what they see as the headline for the webinar, once they opt in, the first few lines of the webinar

[17:01] should match with the headline that they opted in for. Once they get on the call, it should match

[17:04] what you talked about on the webinar. Once they get sold, the onboarding and success person should

[17:09] be matching what they said on the sales call. And this sounds so simple and yet no one does it.

[17:14] And literally, if you have complete alignment all the way through your process, you will make so

[17:19] much more money. And this sounds simple. And it is simple to understand, but hard to do because

[17:24] you have to coordinate multiple parties along the same line. But this is what creates streamlined,

[17:31] lubricated sales. We're talking Diddy Lou. So the second part of the sale is where you get into

[17:36] discovery. So in the beginning, it's like, what's the frame you're setting? What's the agenda?

[17:39] We had a much more takeaway version that was still congruent with what was promised on the webinar.

[17:43] The next thing is discovery. And so a lot of people waste time in discovery. And this is where they

[17:49] get caught. They get caught in traps. And I made a whole video about this. You can probably find out

[17:52] my channel. But they go into traps. And so traps are basically where you get too far in the weeds.

[17:57] You get two into the details. And both you and the prospect for get wire there to begin with.

[18:02] And so you want to stay chunked up at the highest level humanly possible because when you stay chunked

[18:06] up, you can focus on a few things that matter that are going to move the needle that are

[18:09] ultimately going to be tied to the biggest r wire around whatever it is that you sell. Stop getting

[18:13] cut and sales calls. And so a lot of sales people will start doing this as they get a little bit

[18:17] more experience. And this is a mistake. And so this is why sometimes you have some of you come into your

[18:21] sales team. They quickly ramp up. They do well. And all of a sudden, their sales number starts slipping.

[18:25] It's because they get cute. They get fancy. They start to start saying words that they've heard

[18:30] around and trying to play business good song or start to play expert. But they're not the expert

[18:35] because they're not the ones doing the delivery. And so you want you always get out of these

[18:40] very detail-oriented questions because as soon as they ask those questions, then they're the

[18:44] ones in control of the conversation and not you because the way you answer could turn them off and say,

[18:48] oh, actually I didn't want that. But now you're the one answering their questions. They're

[18:52] so during discovery, you ask the questions. They give the answers and you stay high level to make

[18:56] sure that you're staying on the line to get to the end. Once you've gone through discovery and you've

[19:00] hit on the pain, you've clearly defined a reason they should be motivated to take action,

[19:04] then we go into the pitch. All right. Now I am a big advocate of a three-pillar framework.

[19:11] And I talk about this in the closer process. And let me tell you some advanced stuff on this.

[19:17] So the more do it yourself, done with you, the product is, the more you want it to be simple.

[19:23] You want it to be one, two, three, ABC, whatever. The more implementation you have, the more done

[19:28] for you it is, the more you want to show here's 11 steps, 27 steps that we follow because what you

[19:34] want someone to see is, oh my god, this is so much work. And then you say, right. And so they

[19:37] believe that it works, but they don't want to do the work. And so you're like, yeah, oh, I believe that

[19:42] if I do 38 steps to improve my YouTube videos, they'll approve. But can you just do it for me?

[19:46] And that's where you want them to go in. But if you're selling a solution that they're supposed to

[19:50] do a certain percentage of the work or a greater percentage of the work, then you want it to be

[19:53] a simple as you really possible. And if you're curious, like, why is do it yourself and

[19:57] done with you more or less the same? Is that I actually see done with you as basically a done do it

[20:02] yourself sale plus accountability, how troubleshooting, getting you unstuck. So it's really just that

[20:08] theoretically, if you just follow the steps, you could do it yourself, but just to make sure

[20:13] that you're successful will add this extra help in rather than, oh, we're going to do it all

[20:17] for you, which is a true done for you offer. And so instead of the three-pillar pitch, what this

[20:21] company was doing was they had a feature pitch or a feature stack. So they were making it seem really

[20:26] complicated and having way too many steps and overwhelming the prospect. But then after the

[20:30] prospects, overwhelms and confused, it was like, great, you got that. So you're going to do it.

[20:34] And then you're like, oh, right. And so they're like, no, thank you. Now if you're like, hey,

[20:37] all of that, I'll do it different pitch. Three-pillar pitch, if you're not sure stick with that,

[20:42] usually crushes. And if you're like, wait, I have six steps for my process. You just chunk up.

[20:46] It means that you just gather two of them together and just make it a larger bucket. And one tiny

[20:50] tweak that we added before the pitch was basically getting them to invite us to sell them. And so we

[20:56] said, hey, given everything that you just said and you're doing X and Revenue, you meet Y qualifications

[21:02] and the fact that your challenge is this, I think that we'll be able to help you out. And that

[21:06] you'd be a great fit. And our experience is in solving this exact problem for your type of person.

[21:12] And if you want, I can walk you through that, but where do you want to go from here?

[21:17] And so then they have to say, no, please walk me through that. And then basically they're

[21:20] giving you permission to launch into three-pillar pitch. Now this last step, step four, was actually

[21:25] execution. And so there's a lot of things that we did here. And so this is not me selling you,

[21:30] done with use solution. This is me actually just trying to help you out. So we did many things

[21:34] to improve execution. And so we actually had a conversation with the founder. And they said,

[21:39] you know, I watched some of these discovery recordings and they look pretty bad. And we said, yeah,

[21:43] well, when was the last time you roleplayed discovery with your team? And they were like,

[21:47] I don't. And they're like, hmm, interesting. And so what we did, and this is going to be mind-blowing

[21:52] to you, is number one is we roleplayed. We actually had the team practiced it, all right? And this isn't

[21:58] with Wigs and handcuffs. We actually had them roleplayed with one another, but maybe that increases

[22:03] to stay so you can do whatever you want on your sales team. The next thing is that there wasn't

[22:07] very good tracking. And so we wanted to track KPIs more closely. And so sometimes if you have two

[22:12] chunked up KPIs, if you just have closed-rate for example, it doesn't give you more,

[22:15] probably like double clickability to look more granularly into how a closeer's doing. And so we want

[22:19] to see, okay, what percentage of people are you getting to show, what percentage of people,

[22:24] when you're on the phone, are you actually making the offer to, what percentage of people are missing

[22:29] because of what specific obstacle or not? And so this gives us a lot more insight into how each

[22:33] individual closer is doing. And then from there, that allows us to personalize the coaching that we

[22:39] have for each of those individual sales guys. Now, if you're still looking at this and you're like,

[22:44] man, what else was there? Well, sometimes it's a who thing, which is, do I believe that you can

[22:49] train anyone to sell? Yes, do I think it's worth it to train everyone to sell? No. Some people

[22:54] just start further back in the line. It says, not worth the resources for the business. And so we

[22:58] ruthlessly prioritize who gets the best calls, who gets the best times? And we do that by who closes the

[23:05] most. And if you eventually get kind of weeded out, you're almost managed someone out of sales.

[23:09] If they consistently show low returns for us, giving them and feeding them opportunities. And so what

[23:14] we did is, if you were below KPI, we cut your calendar in half. If you're still below KPI,

[23:19] you have basically a weager to to prove yourself for your out. And so the next thing that we did

[23:24] is that we routed the best leads to the best closers. So best to best. And this is one of my

[23:29] favorite ways to to increase sales overall. Like if your best closers get the best leads, you'll

[23:34] sell more stuff. If your worst closers get the worst lead, you'll lose the least. And so this is an

[23:38] optimization for any sales process across any business. And then finally, and this is a big one,

[23:43] we incentivize the paid and full because I think this particular business, if I'm not mistaken,

[23:48] the closers have got paid the same if they closed or didn't. But I prefer to close off cash

[23:54] all right, which means that the closers have the same incentive as you. And so let's say you have a

[23:58] $10,000 thing that you sell. Well, if if you have a payment plan, let's say that's five payments of

[24:04] 2K, then the closers are going to get $200 for that because they get just 10% of the $2,000

[24:12] they close. And if they get the paid and full, then they get $1,000 for that sale. So they get paid

[24:17] five times more. And so this incentivizes closers to actually close. And instead of these kind of

[24:22] like limpriced closes, there are rock hard or wrecked closers, no flaccid closes in this house.

[24:28] And that way, you know, that the prospect actually has been sold on an end is more likely to stick

[24:34] within the long term, which for real is actually an important thing. And oftentimes these types of

[24:38] issues come up like these laxive execution when a founder gets a little too far away. And so I

[24:44] like to say you want to know where the bodies are buried. Like you want to know in every department

[24:48] what is going wrong as a founder. And if you get too far away from it, then you don't know,

[24:52] which means you don't really add value because you have no context. And I think a lot of people

[24:57] get too far away from sales or especially revenue generation too quickly because they like want to

[25:02] scale. And they want to give you know, hand off responsibility to people underneath of them.

[25:06] But if when you hand stuff off, stats go down, you have abdicated, not delegated. When you delegate

[25:12] stats stay the same or go up because theoretically, if you give someone who has equal skill,

[25:16] more time to do it because they have more time than you, then stats should improve. And so when you

[25:20] give it to somebody who has less skill than you and you didn't prepare them and you didn't give them

[25:24] a checklist, then it's more likely that stuff's going to go down. And that's where you have to stay there.

[25:27] And they stay stive by side with you until they get it all right. And so with all of this stuff and

[25:31] you're like, holy cow, that actually when you think about a bad framing for, you know, we had to

[25:35] make a congruent. We chunked up discovery to make sure they avoided traps and stayed high level.

[25:40] We simplified it to three pillar pitch with a little bit of a pre pitch. And we did all these

[25:44] things on execution to make sure that the team actually was reading the script and actually saying

[25:48] the words the right way. The result of all of this work was, we got to a 35% close rate. So that was

[25:58] more than a double, whatever that is, 2.4, I think, 2.4x increase in close rate monster. All right,

[26:05] so we're going to talk about the results of this and at the end, I'm going to give you the take

[26:08] ways that I had for this business that you can use. So the result of all that works, we took

[26:12] our CAF from 5,763 to 2,868. So more than or about cut in half what it cost us to get a customer.

[26:25] On top of that, we went from a 1.62 which is very bad, whereas to a 3.96 row as much better.

[26:34] And we took our revenue from 569,000 to 860k per month. So we passed our 10 million dollar

[26:42] run rate and we have sustained that since these improvements have occurred. And then profit,

[26:47] we got to a 30.7% profit margin off of that. And so now this business is making 253,000

[26:54] dollars a month in profit, whereas before it was kind of plateaued and just kind of teetering at that edge.

[26:59] So let's talk about the big takeaways. So what you can do from this for your business no matter

[27:04] what size you're at. So number one is that you have to keep the main thing the main thing.

[27:10] Obviously this business was still generating a decent amount of monthly revenue. But the thing

[27:14] is that people discount how much an increase in revenue can disproportionately drop the bottom line.

[27:20] And so let's see, you've got a business that has 10% margins. If you can increase revenue by 50%,

[27:26] you can in a very real way disproportionately increase profit. So you could increase profit by

[27:31] 5x when you increase revenue by 10% or 20%. And so understanding the relationship between revenue

[27:37] and profit is something that a lot of business owners don't do. And so sometimes it's cool to

[27:42] trim from bottom line, but it's so much better to trace the top line and have that extra revenue

[27:46] fall through. And so big picture here all the way chunked up the constraint was acquisition.

[27:51] We weren't getting enough customers. Now underneath of getting enough customers, you'll notice that

[27:55] there's just a pipeline of things that all could be improved. It's like can we improve our CTR?

[28:00] Can we improve our opt-it? Can we improve our schedule? Can we improve our show?

[28:03] Can we improve the close rate? And so what we did is we just looked at all of them. And the key point

[28:09] here is that we actually looked. And so when we tried to improve the webinar, we weren't just

[28:14] like shooting from the hip. We were like where are people dropping off? Let's fix it. When we look

[28:18] at the sales, we were like where are people suffering? Well, if you're watching the calls,

[28:22] you can see that, wow, the discovery sucks. All right, well, then we need to focus more there at the front.

[28:27] And I will also put this point, is that the front is where a lot of times we're the cash is.

[28:31] So in the beginning of the webinar, we preloaded it. In the beginning of the call, we preloaded it.

[28:36] Right before we did the pitch, we pre-frame it. And so a lot of times people don't understand

[28:40] how powerful the frame is for setting the expedition about what's about to happen next.

[28:45] The next one is execution over plan. All right, so let me explain what I mean by this.

[28:51] If you have call it a mediocre script and you have an exceptional execution, you will still outperform

[28:57] somebody who has an amazing script in one reason, right? Or you have an amazing webinar deck, but you

[29:01] still sound terrible when you do it. You're not going to do as well as somebody who doesn't have as much

[29:05] of a deck, but sounds really smooth and great. And so a lot of times, this is the boring work that

[29:09] people aren't willing to do. They're not willing to watch game tape. They're not willing to

[29:12] roleplay with a team. They're not willing to practice themselves when they do repitures or when they

[29:16] do presentations. So they're not willing to take a content piece, get to the end of it and be like,

[29:20] you know what we can do that better. We can do it again. And so even for this video, we

[29:23] re-did the intro five times before you actually saw that. And so you have to be willing to repeat

[29:28] successful actions and just get 5% better over and over and over and over again because that

[29:33] bitterness across this whole thing compounds. And so one of the big things that I've learned

[29:38] around improving anything is that you can actually have measurement as intervention. It's like,

[29:43] okay, that's a big fancy word. Is that a drug rehab thing? No, that's not what I mean.

[29:47] Um, if you want someone to lose weight, the first step is to get them to measure their weight.

[29:53] And you can actually just have someone measure their weight and they will lose weight.

[29:57] If you just have someone report on their profit, they will make more profit. If you just have

[30:01] their report there, show rate, schedule rate, close rates and reinforce that on a regular daily

[30:05] basis where it affects their behavior in a cadence where they can change it, then they will.

[30:10] And so one of the easiest things that you can do to improve any business is start measuring the

[30:15] stuff that matters. And if you hate looking at the stat, you should look at it twice because that

[30:19] means I want you to feel the pain so that it causes you to change. And one of the big things is that

[30:25] better is oftentimes one of the lower risk ways versus new. All right. So if you want to expand

[30:33] or improve a business, let's say you're struggling for whatever reason, part of you wants to do new

[30:36] because new is sexy, new is fun, new shiny object. But the thing is is that what you're currently

[30:40] doing is already proven to a certain degree. And so simply doing more or doing the same thing better

[30:45] is a better risk adjusted move because you already know this works. And so fundamentally, if we get

[30:51] more people to show, we will close at least as many as we did before. If we pre frame with more urgency

[30:57] and we get more people to book, we will close more sales on the next call. Right? Is that fundamentally

[31:02] thinking through this is that more or getting an improvement to augment or get better will always

[31:07] fundamentally in the same system and prove it. And so just focusing on those things, which usually just

[31:13] will give you disproportionate return and oftentimes that drops to the bottom line. And one of the

[31:18] first rules of entrepreneurship that I have is use what you've got. Now, if we look at the team that

[31:27] they had and the process they had, we didn't change them from a webinar. We didn't change them from

[31:31] a phone sale. We didn't even change their calendar availability. But we just stayed at the fact

[31:35] until the truth. We said, hey, we only have this many slots. We only have this many sales guys. This

[31:39] is actually live. And so we wanted to reinforce the things that we were already doing, but simply

[31:43] telling them that we were doing it. And you get zero benefits from doing something that you do

[31:49] not communicate. Everything in business is about perceived benefits, perceived scarcity, perceived

[31:56] urgency. So if you have a deadline but don't let people know, there is no deadline. If you have

[32:00] scarcity, there's only so many slots you can take. But you don't let people know, you have no scarcity.

[32:04] If you are live, but you don't tell people you live, you're going to have the same effect as a

[32:08] recorded webinar. Arser recorded event, which eliminates the competitive advantage that you did

[32:12] this to begin with. So we got greedy in this business because Yola, why not? So what we did was we implemented

[32:18] an upsell. And so rather than covering this video, because this is front end, I want to talk about what

[32:22] we did in the upsell in this video. And if it's not out yet, check this one out.

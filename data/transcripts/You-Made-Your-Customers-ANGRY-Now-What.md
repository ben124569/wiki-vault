[00:00] Everybody messes up. It's part of business. Your employees are going to mess up. You're going to mess up as a boss.

[00:04] Your customers are going to think you messed up even when you didn't mess up. Messing up happens.

[00:08] And so if you act every time like you have never had a mess up before, then you are going to mess up even worse.

[00:16] And so I'm going to talk about three different stories about big mess ups that I have done and been an

[00:20] experience or of and some tactical things that you can do that have made our businesses so much better and

[00:26] turn one star reviews into five star reviews and the step-by-step process thing you threw that.

[00:31] What do you do when you mess up? Right? Because you're going to mess up in business. You're going to mess up with a

[00:36] customer. You're going to build someone the wrong amount. You're going to give someone the wrong date.

[00:41] You're going to forget to onboard someone. You're going to have a package that doesn't get

[00:44] delivered. It gets delivered to the wrong address. You're going to onboard someone and put the wrong

[00:49] companies logo on it. And every one of those examples that I just said is something that we have

[00:53] done at some point in my career. And so I want to tell you two stories and then I want to drive

[01:00] home a couple of principles that have served us well. Usually if you want but they have worked

[01:05] pretty well for us. And so I'll tell you two kind of polar extremes. So I buy a lot of gym equipment.

[01:11] Even though I'm not even in the gym just retectingly anymore, I have a massive gym that is in our

[01:17] headquarters. That's really sweet. I'll just put it that way. We feel like 85 unique pieces in the gym and

[01:22] just for me in the team. And so all the pieces are bought from individual people. I put the

[01:29] pieces together. So it's not just one distributor. And so I had a piece of equipment that I bought

[01:35] and I was really excited about it because I was like, oh man, I love this piece. It's going to be awesome.

[01:39] And when it showed up, it was bent. The frame was bent. And the weight stack was kind of off. And so

[01:46] one of the main poles was bent so then it was like this whole ordeal. And we call the company up.

[01:50] He was like, well, I mean, you accepted the shipment. And I was like, yeah, because the truck

[01:56] guy was like, what do you want me to do this? I was like, all right, we'll drop it off. He's like, well,

[01:59] as soon as you accept this shipment, it's your liability. And I don't know if it like it happened

[02:04] before or after that. And I was like, well, I'm telling you it happened before. And I just wanted

[02:08] to help the guy out who is the truck driver like complete is complete the runs that you had for the

[02:12] day. And he was like, sorry, did. And I was like, all right, well, I mean, can we can we get like the

[02:19] pieces or something like a new frame that you can ship out just that piece? And he's like, well,

[02:23] that's going to be extra and I'm like, dude, I bought this thing. It arrived not the way that I bought it.

[02:30] And now I'm incurring additional costs in terms of financial costs. But I also have the additional

[02:34] cost of now I'm talking to you when I'd rather be using the piece of equipment. And so the

[02:40] TLDR of that is I basically just threw the piece out. And I hate the person who I did business with.

[02:45] And I will tell anybody who ever considers buying from them that they suck. Now, let's take the

[02:51] alternative example. So last year I went to Orlando for Jim Khan and we stayed at the Ritz.

[03:02] And when I went to the Ritz, we'd had our team with us. And so we went out, they have a

[03:07] Michelin star restaurant there, which by the way, I found out was actually named after Michelin

[03:11] tires, totally random. I saw the Michelin tire man at the front of the restaurant. I was like,

[03:15] this feels weird. But it's actually what it is. Anyways. And so we go in there and it's this

[03:19] really nice restaurant or whatever. But it took three and a half hours to eat our entire meal.

[03:26] We didn't get drinks for like 45 minutes. We didn't get the appetizers until minute 90.

[03:32] And I was like, dude, this is, I was like, I honestly just want to go get Chick-fil-A. I don't even care.

[03:36] Right? And so anyways, we finished the whole dining experience. If you want to call

[03:40] that. And the manager of the hotel, our team was like, hey, just letting you know, like this was

[03:47] pretty tough. And as soon as the manager found out about that, he was so upset. He was like, oh my

[03:54] God, I can't believe this happened. We had just switched staff over. We're training some team up.

[03:57] And I think we were under short, you know, stores staff that day, whatever. He said, but that's

[04:01] 100% our fault. He said, please let me make it up to you. And so for the remainder of the trip,

[04:07] like, one, he comped the dinner that we had there, which was expensive. Then we got upgraded,

[04:13] I think, rooms for the rest of our stay. He said, please, like, they delivered like

[04:19] fruit baskets and drinks and other stuff to our room throughout the day. And my teams are

[04:24] so it's not just me, like, we had eight people with us this day and four or five rooms.

[04:29] And so all of everybody got taken care of, he made us reservations at two different restaurants.

[04:34] The next basically, every of the night for us to choose from. And then he met us at the restaurant

[04:38] to see us at the table. He got us the app, judges, and drinks at the restaurants that he met

[04:43] us at to make sure that we were okay. Now, I'll tell you this. Since then, if I go to Orlando,

[04:51] I stay at the Ritz. And I talked, and I talked to Havier, because Havier is my dude and Havier goes above

[04:55] and beyond. And the other guy at the other company, I don't say anything about. Now, I don't even

[05:00] want to say the name of the company because I don't want to give them airtime. All right.

[05:03] And so I think there's some really interesting principles about this that we've taken from

[05:09] for our business. So Disney says that there's 37 magic moments that it takes to make up for one

[05:15] tragic moment. And I think there's two kind of levels to thinking about this. So the magic moments,

[05:21] it means it takes so many good things to make up for one bad thing. So buy up for all into

[05:26] to purchase, avoid the tragic moment, because it's going to take you so many to make up for it.

[05:30] But if you do have that tragic moment, then you have to do a ton. And I see that on kind of

[05:34] bidirectionally. Now, one of the things that I like to think about a lot is like, I never want

[05:40] to become someone's project. And what I mean by that is like, if you piss someone off or you do

[05:46] something wrong and you know you did something wrong, you don't, you don't want that person to

[05:51] stew and just think like, how am I going to destroy this person? Like you don't want to become someone's

[05:58] project. And so I've talked about the angry button. I'm going to get to that in a second. But I

[06:01] actually want to hit on this point, because I think it's really important, which is that a refund to a

[06:06] customer is an apology. But you have to do better than that. If you hit your wife and then you

[06:12] apologize, it's not just like, oh, we're neutral. It's just as if I had a hitter. It's like, and I'm

[06:18] doing this as a natural extremely baphyperbolic. But like you're logging someone and saying, I'm sorry,

[06:23] is not enough. And so let me, let me prove the point. If you accidentally kill someone in Man's

[06:30] letter, society deems you saying, sorry, family, isn't enough. So what is the government do?

[06:36] They sentence you and they put you in prison. So they say, you have to say, sorry, and you have to

[06:41] pay 10 years because of involuntary manslaughter. They say, sorry, isn't enough. And so refunding someone

[06:48] isn't enough. If, if, if, have year at the rits had just refunded me, the meal, I wouldn't be like

[06:54] stoked. I would have been like, well, you wasted three and a half hours of my night. And it's, and like,

[06:59] the food was cold, like, all these other things like, I'm not like, I'm not back to neutral.

[07:02] Right? Like, one tragic moment, he gave me a magic moment. Okay, give me a refund. And so one of the

[07:07] things that you have to wrap your head around and this took me some time is like, you actually are

[07:10] going to go negative on refunds. Meaning, like, you're going to lose money. You're not just going to be,

[07:14] like, oh, well, you paid me a hundred bucks. So I'm going to pay you a hundred dollars back now, or even,

[07:18] it's no because there's additional costs that they incur. And so like, they got dressed up. Like,

[07:24] or like, if we got dressed up to go out this nice restaurant, we have expectations of the evening

[07:28] that are going to be really good. And so not only did we pay money, but we paid time, and every

[07:33] person might, you know, the, the, the, the gals of my team got all dolled up and all that stuff. And all

[07:36] of this is for it goes completely into the tragic perspective. And so as a customer or one of your

[07:41] customers has one of these experiences, it's like, dude, refunding is them is not enough. A real

[07:46] quick guys, if you guys are enjoying this, don't be a square share. I don't know, I'm going to come

[07:51] up, keep doing rhymes for this. But if you can screenshot this right now wherever you're listening,

[07:56] and post it and tag me, I'm going to share as many of these as it can on social media. And I will

[08:00] certainly make more of them if you tell me that you like them. And so screenshot, share, tag, and I will

[08:06] see you in five seconds. And so we have to do, have to go above and beyond. And so one of the issues that

[08:14] happens though is that when, when it happens, and this is, this is now me talking to the teammates

[08:18] of people who work in businesses, like, what you can't do, and I'm just, I'm just, please, I'm

[08:23] begging you. What you can't do is try and minimize it to the customer, right? Like,

[08:28] have you, or could it be like, oh, I mean, like, basically by saying you're being ridiculous,

[08:33] don't be a victim. Like, that's what that, like, that's whatever you say when the person's like,

[08:37] hey, the food was late, the what all you're doing is trying to invalidate them. You're basically

[08:42] saying you're lying, or you're not telling the truth, or, I mean, pick your poison and your

[08:48] bits is saying that you don't matter. That's what you're saying. And so what happens is, is that people

[08:54] then escalate to be like, yes, I do matter and you don't understand and not only that, but I'm

[08:59] going to punish you. And so what do you think one star reviews are? Think about it for a second.

[09:04] A one star review is a customer's way of being the judicial system and saying, okay, this person

[09:11] refunded me, but they needed to do more, and so I'm still going to jam them. I'm still going to put them

[09:16] in prison, even though they apologize for killing my husband in manslaughter, right? Even though they

[09:21] apologize, that wasn't enough. So I'm going to punish them with the review because that's all I

[09:26] can do. Those are the things that they have control over. And so we have to go above and beyond. And so

[09:32] I'll give you an example recently. And so we had a scheduling miss happen. And we had seven people

[09:39] were going to fly out to our headquarters. And basically they came here and there was nothing

[09:44] happening that day because the sales team messed up times. And so it's like, and five of these

[09:50] for international, think about this. You travel across the world to you get your expectations up.

[09:56] Some people have to apply for visas. Big big big, big expectations, big work, big money, all of

[10:02] these things like beforehand, right? And they show up and like nothing's happening. There was a scheduling

[10:08] miss app, right? And so what do you do? Right? Like that's a big big mess up. That's a big mess up.

[10:15] It's absolutely unacceptable. So here's what you don't do. You don't say, hey, you should

[10:21] check the email or hey, we sent some other correspondence that might have you don't conflict it.

[10:26] Like you don't go into any of that because it doesn't matter. They don't care. What matters is that

[10:31] it's always immediately your fault. And you have to be angry about it than they are. And this is the

[10:38] thing that is that even though I preach this, it's still hard to do when you're in the moment.

[10:42] Because no one wants to accept fault because fault is associated with all these negative things

[10:46] in our past because in the schooling system, if you say you're fault, you go to detention.

[10:49] Like you get punished by saying it's your fault. So you always want to blame. Hey,

[10:53] Timmy is the one who turned the music up, not me. So Timmy gets punished. But the reality is that

[10:57] in business, you always wanted to be your fault because if it's your fault, it's under your control.

[11:01] Which means you you have the power to fix it. That's what's key. And so as soon as you have that

[11:07] instance, you jump in the angry boat as fast as you can. You want to be quicker to the draw

[11:11] getting angry than the other person. And a lot of times customers will have one of these experiences

[11:16] and they'll shoot out this situation to wait to see how you respond because they want to,

[11:21] they want you to be upset about this because they are already angry and they're trying to contain

[11:25] themselves, trying to contain their emotions. And what you need to do is be the one who gets emotional

[11:31] for them. That is the ultimate validation is that something bad happens and you say that's ridiculous.

[11:38] That's unacceptable. Of course we're going to give you your money back. Of course, I'm going to

[11:42] refund all of your travel expenses, which by the way is what we did. We give them the money back.

[11:46] Give the travel expenses. But that's still not enough. It's not enough. Because if you travel

[11:50] across the world, you're like, okay, well, great. My flights. But like, I just lost four days of travel

[11:56] and I had these expectations that were met. And so we're taking the whole, you know, the seven

[12:01] people out, four, three hours. We're going to go to dinner. We'll talk probably, I'll probably

[12:07] end up doing three hours of personalized consulting for each of these businesses, which is not something

[12:11] that I would normally do. In an effort to go above and beyond and make up for something that

[12:17] that otherwise shouldn't have happened. And the reality is, is this, like, let's put our, let's

[12:22] put our hats on for a second. Is this my fault, Alex is fault? Was I the one who took the call?

[12:28] Was I the one who messed up the scheduling? No. But guess who's fault it is? It's mine. Right?

[12:34] I pay the people. I'm the, the buck stocks with me. And so the idea that sometimes I see business owners

[12:40] saying things like, well, that, you know, my team messed, dude, you fucking messed up. Like,

[12:46] that's the thing about the entrepreneurship game is like, you get, you get the upside,

[12:49] but you get the downside. You get it both. And you've got to be able to be comfortable with that.

[12:54] And the thing is, is like, you have to accept that. I want to like, this is the thing as soon as I go

[12:58] on my mind is like, I flip this switch or becomes a game of how can I blow these people away.

[13:04] All right. That as soon as I have like a clear and obvious wrong, and it happens. We mess things up.

[13:09] We're human and humans work for us and humans make mistakes. And so when as soon as, as soon as that

[13:15] happens, it becomes this game of, oh, our wise out the window. I'm already going to lose money on this.

[13:19] Done. Right. Like, you're going to give the money back. Plus extra cost that they incurred.

[13:24] Plus now you're still going to incur the cost that you would have normally done to deliver whatever

[13:29] it is that you do, right? But the thing is is, I am in a fucking advocate of the Ritz Carlton in

[13:36] Orlando and Havier. I tell everybody, when they're like, hey, where should I go? I'm like, go there,

[13:40] go to Havier. He's the fucking man. And I tell everybody that. And so I'll bet you they have more than

[13:45] made up for the transgression of the one restaurant experience and him meeting me at the other

[13:51] restaurants and sitting us down and taking five minutes before two or three or four other experiences we

[13:57] had while we were there. Those little minutes meant the world's me because I know what kind of business

[14:02] owner, what kind of entrepreneur, what kind of operator operates that way. It's somebody who gets it.

[14:07] You get the game, which is that did Havier mess up? He is not even, he's not even responsible for

[14:13] the restaurant. It's not even his division. But he did it because he knows that I don't care.

[14:19] And he had the power to fix it. So even if it wasn't his fault for the transgression,

[14:24] he had the power to fix it. And so it becomes his responsibility to make it right.

[14:29] Inside note here with the angry boat is one, you want to confront ahead on. You don't want to

[14:33] push you foot around it. You got to say like, this was our mess up and I'm super pissed about it.

[14:37] Second, you want to get in fast. Third, validate, validate, validate, validate. You want them to

[14:41] feel seen. You want the same feel heard. You want them to feel felt. You want them to feel felt.

[14:46] You want them to feel like you, you feel their pain more than they feel their pain.

[14:51] Because here's the, here's the reality. And this is the, this is the, this is the underlying

[14:55] highlight point. There is no way that you can minimize someone's pain. Only they can minimize it.

[15:03] You cannot invalidate a way someone's feeling about being wronged. The only person who can say,

[15:10] you know what, it's not a big deal. Is them. And so the only way for that to happen is for you to be

[15:17] more upset so that they say, hey, it's not that big of a deal come down. And then they said it,

[15:24] not you. Because if you say, hey, it's not that big of a deal come down. They're going to be like,

[15:28] RIP, yes it is, you need to validate me. And then you're like, oh my God, you're right. I should

[15:33] kill myself with like, do what? Don't kill yourself. And you're like, right. And they're like,

[15:36] it's not that big of a deal. Like, okay, fantastic. They come back down. And I say the, I use,

[15:40] I use hyperbotic extremes to make a point, which is if you want someone to feel better about something

[15:48] that you did that wronged them, they have to initiate it. And the only way they're going to

[15:53] initiate it is if you make it a bigger deal to you than it is to them. And so I want to, I want

[15:57] to do a quick transition to employee stuff around this. So if you were the person who messed up,

[16:05] like, you're the actual person. Now, of course, it's the entrepreneur. It's, it's always our fault,

[16:09] for sure. But on some level, if you're the person who messed up on the team, let me tell you what not to

[16:13] do. Don't try and skirt along. Don't try and pretend like it's not a big deal. When you say to the

[16:19] team, don't try and minimize, you're like, oh, yeah, I kind of messed up the, the dates on, on that thing.

[16:23] Don't fucking do that. Because it's the same thing in reverse. Because the, like, the owner, your manager,

[16:30] your leader, the entrepreneur, he's the customer. She's the customer in this incident. And I'll tell you

[16:35] what I want to see. I want to see you losing your fucking mind over how upset you are at this mess

[16:40] up. Because the thing is, if you're not upset enough, I'm going to make you upset. And so one of us

[16:45] is going to make you upset and you want it to be you, not me, being really real with you. And so

[16:52] what I'll tell you what I, I'll tell you what I told the individual. I said, listen,

[16:59] I know, because I know, I know, I know the person, you know, like obviously multiple parties

[17:03] bubble, but at some point, sometimes the buck and stop is something. I said, listen, I know that

[17:08] you're beating yourself up over this and you're beating yourself up over it in silence. I was like,

[17:12] but the thing is is like, no one cares. No one will give you credit for beating yourself up in

[17:17] silence. They will give you credit for two things, making it right and making sure it never happens again.

[17:23] That's it. That's all that matters. And so there is, there is no more useless

[17:29] emotion than feeling sorry for yourself. It changes nothing. Like no one gets better by feeling

[17:35] sorry for themselves at all. And so if you did mess up, just skip past the guilt part, skip past

[17:45] the shame part, skip past that and go immediately into the, what can I do to make it right? What can

[17:50] I do to make it better than right? Sure, you hit your wife. Sure, you said, sorry, but now what?

[17:53] We got to take out the dinner and get her nice necklace, get her some flowers, and then go to

[17:57] fucking anger therapy and make sure that you know like whatever. Like you do all the things to go

[18:02] from tragic to neutral, and then you go above neutral to try and make them into a champion. And then

[18:07] you do all the things to make sure it doesn't happen again. That's the point. And so too many

[18:12] businesses basically think that a refund is the highest level of what they can do to make it.

[18:17] Whether like a gave him his money back, what else does he want? A shitload more. That's what,

[18:21] that's what they want. Way more. And the thing is, I'll tell you this, is that if you

[18:25] incur the cost of the refund to plus the additional cost, and you lose actual money,

[18:31] actual resources trying to make it right, guess what you try not to do? You try not to fuck up

[18:35] so much in the future, because you know the real cost of it isn't just like, and like, don't even

[18:42] get me started on companies that won't give a refund on set. Like, if people, if a huge percentage

[18:49] of your customers are asking for refunds, fix your shit or stop selling it. Like, either you're

[18:55] selling it wrong and you're setting crazy expectations that no one, no one can, no one can live up to,

[19:00] or you're just delivery sucks. But like, if you're getting lots of refund requests,

[19:06] and then you, or like, well, I can't give the refunds otherwise I won't be in business.

[19:08] The maybe you shouldn't be in business. Fix your shit. And I get, I get, I get, I get, I get,

[19:17] I get jazzed about this. I like, I came into the team as well. I was like, oh, I know I'm

[19:20] talking about because this is hop because we just mess this up. We just have this mess up happen.

[19:25] And like, you have to own it and you have refunds on enough refunds or apologies, no one cares

[19:32] about apologies. People want more than apology because they will punish you and society believes that,

[19:37] too. You don't just say, I'm sorry. I killed somebody. I'm sorry. I was in a, I was a drunk driver

[19:42] and I killed your kid. I'm sorry. It's not enough. A refund is an apology. A refund is sorry.

[19:48] And people want more than that. And so you got to get them to neutral and then, and here's

[19:52] the cool part. So this is my silver lining for this is that if you do, turn a tragic moment into a

[19:59] series of magic moments afterwards, you can create brand champions. You have a higher potential

[20:05] to take somebody and make them a true believer in what you do. If when you mess up, you own it

[20:12] and you make it better than right because they're like, these guys messed up but they went so far

[20:17] out of their way. And if anybody's ever had this experience and I hope you have at least one time

[20:21] in your life or a business owner when above and beyond, they didn't just make it right. They made

[20:25] it better than right. And then what happens? You become a customer for life. You have a higher

[20:31] potential for being a customer for life. And I remember there was a quite in some line who was in the

[20:35] hot sauce business, just kind of random. And he had a customer. So he had sent them a hot sauce kit

[20:43] or something and it didn't have caps. And so he couldn't use the hot sauce because it didn't

[20:48] have a cap in the kit. And so he sent a handwritten note to them and he sent extra caps, not just

[20:55] enough but more of them just in case or whatever. And they said, they sent him back a note being

[21:02] like, wow, that was so nice of you, like you went above me on whatever. And so he actually started

[21:06] sending the kits with handwritten notes with an extra cap because of that experience. Because

[21:13] that person then went change their one star, two of five star because of the great experience.

[21:18] And I don't know if you've ever done this, you've seen this like updated reviews where people

[21:21] say, hey, I left this one star, the company found to reach out to me, he got on the phone with

[21:25] me, he made it right. The thing is is that people want to punish you when they feel invalidated.

[21:30] And you can absolutely, you can, you can make them feel validated. Like the reason malpractice,

[21:36] so they did a bunch of research, like it's both my parents or physicians. There's a ton of,

[21:41] ton of research on malpractice. The people who get sued from malpractice are doctors that people hate

[21:47] not people who make the most mistakes. Then interesting. So they tell this story of a lady who

[21:54] had some sort of thing that happened that was wrong and like a clear loss it. And she had had

[21:58] like two or three physicians that she was going for like cancer or something, whatever it was.

[22:03] And when the, uh, she hired this malpractice to her and it because she wanted to go after this

[22:07] physician. And so after doing more research, the lawyer was like, hey, it's not this guy who actually

[22:12] technically made the mess up, it's this one, your primary carrier, your general physician.

[22:16] And the lady was like, oh, Sarah, oh, I love Sarah. No, it's, it's, it's fine. And so it had nothing

[22:23] to do with the transgression. It had to do with the fact that they actually hated the person.

[22:27] And so the thing is is like people, people want to punish you if they don't like you. And you

[22:32] increase the likelihood that they do like you by going above and beyond. And so here's one tactical

[22:37] thing, one more last tactical thing, uh, for my notes that I'll give you.

[22:41] If you deal in a business that has lots of transactions, high volume transactions every day,

[22:46] what you want to do is you want to give someone a box of responsibility, one of you have a box of

[22:50] decision making power. And so they do this in the hotel industry and this is what I like stealing things

[22:54] from one industry and putting it to another. And so for example, if someone wakes up in the middle of

[22:59] the night because they smell smoke, right? And they come, they call the front desk and they say, hey,

[23:02] I smell smoke. I can't sleep above a buck. That front desk person, if they have no power to fix it,

[23:10] the customer still holds them responsible. So they basically, you give them a losing card that

[23:15] can't do anything. But if you say these are the things that you have within your responsibility,

[23:19] that within your power, you can give someone free free drink credits. You can give someone a free meal.

[23:25] You can give someone a free upgrade. All right. So these are the three things you can do based on the

[23:28] level of the mess up, right? If someone had to wait 20 minutes for a bellhop, okay, is that like

[23:34] end of the world? Probably not. Here's two drinks just in case you're waiting or for tonight to

[23:40] make it special before you go out. All right. Now, if someone can't sleep because they're smoke and

[23:44] they shouldn't have had smoke in the, that's a pretty big mess up. So what do we do? Well, if the

[23:49] front desk person has the power to upgrade them for the next room for the next night, then you

[23:53] probably refund them for the night before and give them a free upgrade for the next night.

[23:58] But you have to give people, you have to give your team, the two or three things that they can do

[24:03] and then just say, listen, if we're, if you're using up more than five of these a month, then like we need to

[24:07] fix a process here. But these are things that you can give out as freebies that you bake into the

[24:12] profit margins of the business so that you know that you can make things right when things do

[24:15] inevitably grow up because people are human and humans doing with humans, leads to mistakes. So

[24:21] what to do when you mess up is don't just refund someone, that is not enough. Go above and

[24:28] be on and if you do that you might just turn a hater into a lifelong fan.

[24:35] Be awesome, take care of your customers, well that good stuff. Oh, by the way, share this if you can,

[24:41] mean the lot to me and all that stuff. Otherwise, otherwise I'll stop doing these. Not really,

[24:47] I will stop doing it, but it would just mean a lot more if you did that because then I'll know

[24:51] that you do like it and then I will actually, I will, I will probably make more if you share

[24:55] that rather than stop or start. I will probably make more if you share these.

[24:59] Anyways, keep being awesome, get you to do.

[00:00] You're about to watch a conversation between me and Alexia Marr, who is a legal attorney for musicians.

[00:04] The problem is that he's losing money and lots of it.

[00:07] Anyways, about six months of cash left before his dream is going to go under.

[00:11] My name is Dr. Muzzy, an acquisition.com to perform a company that last year did over $250 million

[00:15] in aggregate revenue and we're going to take all of those findings and help him save his business. Enjoy.

[00:20] Let's do a quick, quick overview.

[00:22] So walk me through the business as a currently stance right now. What's revenue?

[00:25] I revenue for the last 12 months has been 300,000.

[00:28] Profit.

[00:30] Negative.

[00:31] So we're losing money.

[00:33] Okay, how much?

[00:34] We lost 100,000.

[00:36] Okay, minus 100,000.

[00:38] Yes, you're like I could have done nothing and I would have just had zero at the end of the year.

[00:42] It's the working all year and then being worse off.

[00:44] Mird.

[00:45] All right, what are the business units?

[00:47] Right now we have services.

[00:49] Okay.

[00:50] We have education.

[00:51] Okay, and who do you sell to?

[00:53] I sell to artists and entrepreneurs in the Latin music industry.

[00:57] Musicians who are Latin American speaks baddish.

[01:01] Yeah.

[01:02] Okay, and you sell service.

[01:03] You saw education was last one software.

[01:04] What's the revenue breakdown between?

[01:06] Did any of these make money?

[01:07] Yeah, this the services.

[01:09] So this made my was profitable.

[01:11] Yeah, that was profitable.

[01:12] Okay, what was the top line of bottom one here?

[01:13] So we made 131,000.

[01:17] Okay.

[01:18] And we made about 10k for the last 10, 12.

[01:22] And profit on that.

[01:23] And profit.

[01:24] You just didn't lose money on this.

[01:25] Okay.

[01:26] And then education.

[01:27] 131 as well.

[01:29] How coincidental?

[01:30] All right, profit.

[01:32] But we lost there like most of the money we lost between the two.

[01:37] Okay.

[01:38] So it's between the two because they're under one company.

[01:40] Got it.

[01:41] And so this is 40k.

[01:42] I'm just going to put this for the software.

[01:44] And then the money that you lost here was how much until I guess 100,000.

[01:48] 110,000.

[01:49] Okay.

[01:50] Put a little negative smiley face there.

[01:52] Maybe a little tears.

[01:53] There we go.

[01:54] Very sad.

[01:55] Okay.

[01:56] So we're going to do more tears.

[01:57] All right.

[01:58] So how are you getting customers right now?

[02:00] Before we talk about how we're going to fix this, how are you getting customers?

[02:02] So we create content on YouTube.

[02:04] We have about 90,000 subscribers.

[02:06] Is that we're most like everybody's coming from?

[02:08] Yeah.

[02:09] Okay.

[02:10] So we got YouTube.

[02:12] All right.

[02:13] What else we got?

[02:14] Then they usually go to our Instagram page from YouTube.

[02:18] Yeah.

[02:19] Okay.

[02:20] Is that the, that's like the call to action in the videos.

[02:22] You know, like the call to action is to go to our website.

[02:26] A lot of people go to Instagram to just ask questions.

[02:30] Like, hey, I have this problem.

[02:32] Can you help me?

[02:33] Interesting.

[02:34] Okay.

[02:35] Got it.

[02:36] So where did the sales come from?

[02:38] The sales comes through DMs.

[02:40] So usually they go to Instagram and they will ask a question.

[02:44] So the place that you don't intend people to go is where you make your money.

[02:47] Yeah.

[02:48] Instagram.

[02:49] And you don't tell people to go there.

[02:50] They just find out.

[02:51] No.

[02:52] Yeah.

[02:53] They just find us.

[02:54] Okay.

[02:55] So we got to go there.

[02:56] So we got to go there.

[02:57] So we got to go there.

[02:58] So we got to go there.

[02:59] So we got to go there.

[03:17] So we got to go there.

[03:18] So we got to go there.

[03:19] Okay.

[03:20] Got it.

[03:21] So you're converting 2% into options.

[03:23] Yeah.

[03:24] There for free course.

[03:26] Okay.

[03:27] So we're getting off the course.

[03:28] Yeah.

[03:29] Got it.

[03:30] Okay.

[03:31] And then from there.

[03:32] Usually we'll try to sell them the course or main course.

[03:37] How do you try and sell them?

[03:38] Do you like reach out to them?

[03:39] Do you?

[03:40] With every video, we usually tell them,

[03:42] and if you want to learn more about this,

[03:44] make sure to to enroll in our community.

[03:47] Then, then, next step for that, though,

[03:49] go through the course and receive some nurturing emails.

[03:52] And then from the emails is how they buy and what are they buying from the emails.

[03:57] So right now, we're selling about 9.

[04:00] 9 out of the 150.

[04:02] Our basic offer is $500, one time fee.

[04:06] So they have access to all of our courses now and forever.

[04:10] Okay.

[04:11] And then we have an upsell or another 500.

[04:14] Do they want to funnel or something?

[04:15] Yeah.

[04:16] They want to do the same card.

[04:17] Okay.

[04:18] When they buy the 500, we'll upsell them to another 500 for monthly Q&A.

[04:24] Per month?

[04:25] No.

[04:26] Just lifetime as well.

[04:27] Forever.

[04:28] Okay.

[04:29] Oh gosh.

[04:30] Okay.

[04:31] So there's so many, I mean, where there's so many things.

[04:34] Before we, you know, tear this apart, the good news is,

[04:37] I actually think that you'll be able to make significantly more money pretty quickly.

[04:40] So this is your education side?

[04:42] Yeah.

[04:43] All right.

[04:44] What's the service side?

[04:45] And the same Instagram page, if they want a consultation instead of learning, because they say,

[04:52] I'm not interested in learning.

[04:54] Sure.

[04:55] I just want to watch it.

[04:56] Yeah.

[04:57] When you do it, we'll then send them to our calendar link to schedule a consultation.

[05:02] And that's $250 for an hour.

[05:05] So you go DM to calendar.

[05:08] Okay.

[05:09] And then you charge before you have the call.

[05:12] Yeah.

[05:14] Okay.

[05:15] Do you want to do 50?

[05:16] Do the good news is there's lots of room for improvement.

[05:19] Okay.

[05:20] So if you're calendar and then you charge 250 per hour, and they pay on the calendar to have access.

[05:26] Yes.

[05:27] Man.

[05:28] All right.

[05:29] And so that means that you sold somewhere in the neighborhood of six hundred and 30.

[05:35] So I'm going to like whatever the math is.

[05:37] One thirty one times four.

[05:38] That's four hundred five twenty.

[05:40] So five twenty four.

[05:42] So five hundred twenty four hours is what you're able to sell in services last year.

[05:45] You can do that.

[05:46] Thirty one.

[05:47] Okay.

[05:48] Between the consultations, because usually when they go through the consultation, say, for example,

[05:54] the in the last three months with average about nine to ten calls.

[05:58] Mm-hmm.

[05:59] So then from there, we'll either tell them, do you need a deliverable service?

[06:03] So for example, register in your trademark or business formation.

[06:06] Those are three out of the ten.

[06:08] Okay.

[06:09] And then another three are ongoing legal services.

[06:12] Okay.

[06:13] And what other business do you have?

[06:15] Let's talk about that.

[06:16] So the other business is the software.

[06:18] Because you're like, you know, I'm not losing money.

[06:20] So I should, I am losing money.

[06:22] Excuse me.

[06:23] So I'm going to spread my attention even more.

[06:24] Yeah.

[06:25] Okay.

[06:26] So there's a story behind that.

[06:27] It's a VC story.

[06:29] So if you want to horror story, I think you will get.

[06:32] We'll get into it.

[06:33] I'm sure.

[06:34] All right.

[06:35] So there's the software come.

[06:36] Mm-hmm.

[06:37] Okay.

[06:38] So the software is.

[06:40] Instagram.

[06:41] Yeah.

[06:42] It's the same thing.

[06:43] Okay.

[06:44] Okay.

[06:45] Usually they'll say, I don't have 250 dollars.

[06:48] I just want to contract.

[06:50] Okay.

[06:51] And we'll tell them, well, you can access, you know, all of our contract templates inside our software.

[06:56] So you can pay for that.

[06:58] Okay.

[06:59] And that's what happens.

[07:00] Right now.

[07:01] And so if you're in a via Instagram, you just said those people,

[07:04] a not a calendar link, and you don't send them this site, you send them to two our web

[07:09] to our software website, which is a different website.

[07:12] Mm-hmm.

[07:13] And then they just check out on that page.

[07:14] They start a free, we had a free moon.

[07:17] Now we're using free trial.

[07:19] Okay.

[07:20] And what's the membership price?

[07:21] Right now is a thousand per year.

[07:23] And that's what, it goes straight to a thousand per year is what you were billing.

[07:26] Yes.

[07:27] We also have monthly version.

[07:29] I can't afford 250 dollars.

[07:31] And you're like, yes.

[07:33] So pay a thousand dollars a year.

[07:34] Before we have a five hundred dollars per year.

[07:37] Yeah.

[07:38] So it was easier.

[07:39] Yeah.

[07:40] The problem is that the value proposition at first was,

[07:42] but pay us and we give you the contracts, but learning that people were turning because once they have the contract they'll download it and just go away.

[07:49] Yeah.

[07:50] We have a couple of decisions that we have to make.

[07:51] Is there any reason that you just don't sell services and make money?

[07:55] So, well, the reality is we started selling services back in 2019.

[08:00] Yeah.

[08:01] So in 2021, people, we got a lot of the man.

[08:05] I couldn't keep up.

[08:06] I started selling courses.

[08:08] So they could, you know, learn about how to do them themselves.

[08:12] And then after that, I'm also contract templates.

[08:15] And then the education side just, you know, we started making them same amount of money and education.

[08:21] This is going to be an important one for you.

[08:23] Yeah.

[08:24] All right.

[08:25] So actually, you know what I'm going to show you on my logo.

[08:27] Two most important concepts in business.

[08:29] Supply in demand and leverage.

[08:31] So, if supply is low and demand is high, what happens to price?

[08:36] It goes up.

[08:37] Is that what happened?

[08:39] Yeah, we started doing that.

[08:41] Yes.

[08:42] But then you created this other thing that was much cheaper.

[08:43] Rather than just saying, I don't have enough supply, pay me more.

[08:46] You're right.

[08:47] All right.

[08:48] We wanted to help more people instead of just.

[08:50] Yeah.

[08:51] But the thing is, is that long enough time rise and you'll have no one if we don't make this business profitable.

[08:55] Right?

[08:56] Yes.

[08:57] So, okay.

[08:58] Tell me why we can't shut down the education in software so that we can just do services.

[09:04] And then we can fix the service business to make it make money.

[09:06] Yeah.

[09:07] So the educational side we already have over 800 people.

[09:10] They'll bought like lifetime.

[09:12] Yeah.

[09:13] Lifetime everything.

[09:14] Lifetime everything.

[09:15] The thing with the education is that it's part of.

[09:18] We are giving back to the community and nobody else is doing this.

[09:22] All right.

[09:23] So every time thanks to the education efforts, we are traveling the world and teaching other people in Guatemala and the Dominican Republic in Spain.

[09:31] How the music business works because in those places our content is the university's content.

[09:37] So it's an impact project, right?

[09:40] So that is why the education, you know, it would be very difficult for us to shut down.

[09:45] And the education without the software is not losing money.

[09:48] It's the software that actually is.

[09:50] Okay.

[09:51] So we did this breakdown.

[09:52] You said the education loses money.

[09:53] So how much money does the education make if you don't have the software?

[09:56] In reality, the education would be a break even.

[09:59] Okay.

[10:00] That whole money is a reducing zero.

[10:03] Yeah.

[10:04] You said this is 110,000 of losses.

[10:06] So that means the software costs you 150,000 a year and makes you 40.

[10:13] Yes.

[10:14] Okay.

[10:15] You could say that.

[10:16] So why can't we be done with the software?

[10:18] So the software right now, there's not a specific reason we can shut it down.

[10:25] We we've seen traction on the B2B side of companies in the music industry that are interested in using our software because their clients like big companies now need a music contracts software to manage their documents.

[10:40] So they play there for us.

[10:42] So what the software?

[10:43] The software.

[10:44] But that is something that.

[10:46] What is your cost you to develop the software?

[10:48] Right now, it's burning 7k a month because we cut every, you know, every employee before.

[10:55] How likely is it do you think that you're going to sell the software?

[10:58] I'm not sure.

[10:59] And the other thing is the software actually right now.

[11:02] The way we are seeing it grow is by bundling services with software.

[11:09] What's obvious is the services the thing everyone needs.

[11:12] And then we just have like this other stuff that we did to be cute.

[11:15] Where do you want to grow from here? What do you want to have happen?

[11:18] The thing that we need is to be profitable.

[11:22] That we can solve very easily.

[11:24] That's the good news.

[11:25] Yeah.

[11:26] But it will just be painful.

[11:27] Yeah.

[11:28] But it's good pain.

[11:29] Growing pains.

[11:30] Yeah.

[11:31] Go on growing pains.

[11:32] If you lose a negative, it's a positive.

[11:34] So, okay.

[11:35] So in a world, hypothetically, where you just ended the software tomorrow.

[11:40] And then you have the education in services.

[11:42] What is required for you to maintain the education?

[11:45] Workwise per week.

[11:46] Right now, it's only one live stream with the community per month.

[11:52] Per month.

[11:53] Yeah.

[11:54] That's amazing.

[11:55] That's it.

[11:56] Okay.

[11:57] Great.

[11:58] Can we just shut down the software?

[11:59] We can do that.

[12:00] Well, that was easy.

[12:01] Okay. Great.

[12:02] I love this for us.

[12:03] Okay.

[12:04] So we're going to X this out.

[12:06] Let's use a red.

[12:07] Let's keep this.

[12:08] Keep this on brand here.

[12:09] So this is a red.

[12:11] I'm going to say that this isn't really a business.

[12:13] I'm going to say this is a charity.

[12:15] You might even want to operate like a nonprofit because it doesn't make any profit anyways.

[12:19] And you're very, you know, kind of impact revenue whatnot.

[12:21] So then what's the cost on the 131,000 services?

[12:25] The cost would be the associate who is delivering the services.

[12:30] Okay.

[12:31] Right now, we have a ref share model.

[12:33] Okay.

[12:34] But we also have because the services, for example, this year,

[12:39] we are already at 150.

[12:41] Okay.

[12:42] Okay.

[12:43] Great.

[12:44] Because now, thanks to the education,

[12:47] the next generation of artists are looking towards us to represent them in deal close.

[12:53] Okay.

[12:54] So from there, we take a commission from the deal.

[12:57] Okay.

[12:58] So for example,

[12:59] we've recently closed several deals.

[13:02] There are above 500,000 for the art.

[13:05] And we take 5% from those.

[13:08] Okay.

[13:09] So do you guys, we're actually an agent for that?

[13:11] No, they're lawyers.

[13:13] Represent those are legal fees that the label will also pay us.

[13:17] The, the, the music industry is not commission, it's heavily commission based.

[13:20] So they get an advance.

[13:22] Yeah.

[13:23] And the label will.

[13:24] So the services strike again and making.

[13:27] Yeah.

[13:28] Wonderful.

[13:29] So what I want to do is reimagine the business and the simplest format possible.

[13:33] So we're going to make you money both short and long term.

[13:36] Is that okay?

[13:37] Yes.

[13:38] All right.

[13:39] So I'm going to draw it across the top here and we're going to draw it in green because this is the money path.

[13:43] All right.

[13:44] It's the money path.

[13:45] You keep your YouTube where it is.

[13:47] Now what I want you to do is I want you to have four different places that you're going to embed cost action.

[13:53] All right.

[13:54] So number one is at the 30% mark of every video.

[13:56] I want you to make a quick 30 second.

[13:58] Like hey, by the way, you know, if you want us to, you know, help you out with your, you know,

[14:02] you're going to be able to do this.

[14:03] So I'm going to do this.

[14:04] So I'm going to do this.

[14:05] So I'm going to do this.

[14:06] So I'm going to do this.

[14:08] So I'm going to do this.

[14:10] So I'm going to do this.

[14:11] So I'm going to do this.

[14:12] So I'm going to do this.

[14:14] So I'm going to do this.

[14:16] So I'm going to do this.

[14:17] So I'm going to do this.

[14:18] So I'm going to do this.

[14:19] So I'm going to do this.

[14:20] So I'm going to do this.

[14:21] So I'm going to do this.

[14:22] So I'm going to do this.

[14:23] So I'm going to do this.

[14:25] So I'm going to do this.

[14:26] So I'm going to do this.

[14:27] So I'm going to do this.

[14:28] So I'm going to do this.

[14:33] But pinned comment so you can own that real estate.

[14:35] We also have your profile on YouTube, which gets traffic as well.

[14:39] And so there's a four places that we can actually just put.

[14:42] And all of the CTAs here are DM me on Instagram.

[14:45] Why are we doing that?

[14:46] Because it already works.

[14:47] I'm not trying to break it.

[14:48] All right.

[14:49] So now everything's going in Instagram.

[14:50] So instead of having the site, we don't even care about the site.

[14:52] Who cares?

[14:53] Doesn't matter.

[14:54] So we're going to do DM me on Instagram.

[14:55] And then from there, what I want you to do is I don't want you to have them

[14:59] book a call without paying.

[15:01] And then what we're going to do is we're going to sell them.

[15:04] And what we're going to do is we're going to sell them package.

[15:07] And we're going to sell to the outcome.

[15:09] And you're going to say, hey, a lot of lawyers like to charge by the hour.

[15:13] The reason that we don't do that model is because it disincentivizes us.

[15:17] Our basically our incentives are a first to you.

[15:20] When we do it by the hour, we're incentivizing to take as long as you really

[15:23] possible.

[15:24] So it means it costs you more and it takes longer.

[15:26] That sucks.

[15:27] What we're going to do is we're just going to charge you for the outcome.

[15:29] Period that's it.

[15:30] How's that sound?

[15:31] Yeah.

[15:32] So we have to qualify them before they can go to the landing page.

[15:36] Because, you know, there's 10 million artists on Spotify.

[15:39] Sure.

[15:40] And only a thousand are professional.

[15:42] Maybe 2000.

[15:43] So do you see that the landing page?

[15:46] Yeah.

[15:47] But they all eat.

[15:49] They all have cars.

[15:50] They all have cell phones.

[15:51] They all pay mortgages and rent.

[15:53] We're not.

[15:54] You sell to a lot of up and commerce and newcomers.

[15:57] They're going to use just like you have been spending your education money that you make money

[16:01] on this dream that you have and losing money.

[16:04] We're going to have them do the same thing.

[16:06] They're going to take their job money and spend it on their dream.

[16:09] And hopefully they make it.

[16:11] But our goal is to try and figure out who's going to make it.

[16:14] Our job is to enable the opportunity.

[16:16] So the pre-qualification that I would have here is just income.

[16:21] Not like, and if you want, you can either Spotify if you think that matters.

[16:24] You know, in the qualification.

[16:25] But fundamentally.

[16:26] Yeah.

[16:27] That's what I figure.

[16:28] Yeah, because if you have work with different artists that there's body vibe.

[16:32] For example, I have a Spotify.

[16:34] I want to get to our player.

[16:35] Yeah.

[16:36] And I have 15,000 monthly listeners.

[16:38] But you wouldn't take that to the term being whether I can pay you or not.

[16:44] So income.

[16:45] But we are currently doing it that way.

[16:47] Yeah.

[16:48] You're right.

[16:49] You're going to use income.

[16:50] But we're going to do it through budget authority and timing.

[16:52] That's the big four.

[16:53] Right.

[16:54] So do you have the money?

[16:55] Is there somebody else who needs to be on the phone?

[16:57] You're grandmother, your dog, your agent, whatever.

[17:00] Need.

[17:01] So how important is this to you?

[17:03] And then timing.

[17:04] If we were to get you set up how quickly would you want us to make this?

[17:07] Get this trademark or get this thing fun.

[17:09] Right.

[17:10] You want to take the people who have the money and want to do it now and are able to make this.

[17:12] That's the qualification.

[17:14] Now, the big question is what are we going to charge?

[17:17] So you're asking me?

[17:18] I'm going to give you a hint.

[17:19] It's more than 250.

[17:20] So you'll play the prices right with what you're going to charge.

[17:23] So the average ticket on the service size between the ongoing one time and the consultation

[17:30] is about 1500.

[17:32] That's the average.

[17:33] Okay.

[17:34] And a lot of that is from people just getting hourly charged.

[17:39] It's no.

[17:40] It's basically the ongoing right now is about the lower ticket is about a thousand per month.

[17:46] Okay.

[17:47] Because we're not charging them by the hour like a traditional lawyer.

[17:53] And this is 750 usually.

[17:55] So you can see that if you combine the other, they're usually get to.

[18:00] So this is what I want you to do.

[18:01] I would love you to charge 5000.

[18:03] I feel like that's going to be a stretch for you emotionally.

[18:06] So how about we start it three?

[18:07] Yeah.

[18:08] Can you do five?

[18:09] Can you emotionally do five?

[18:11] Yeah.

[18:12] We're selling right now.

[18:14] So we're going to sell.

[18:15] So we're going to sell.

[18:17] So we're going to sell.

[18:19] So we're going to sell.

[18:21] So we're going to sell.

[18:23] So we're going to sell.

[18:25] So we're going to sell.

[18:27] So we're going to sell.

[18:29] So we're going to sell.

[18:31] So we're going to sell.

[18:33] So we're going to sell.

[18:35] So we're going to sell.

[18:37] So we're going to sell.

[18:39] So we're going to sell.

[18:41] So we're going to sell.

[18:43] So we're going to sell.

[18:45] So we're going to sell.

[18:47] So we're going to sell.

[18:49] So we're going to sell.

[18:51] So we're going to sell.

[18:53] So we're going to sell.

[18:55] So we're going to sell.

[18:57] So we're going to sell.

[18:59] So we're going to sell.

[19:01] So we're going to sell.

[19:03] So we're going to sell.

[19:05] So we're going to sell.

[19:07] So we're going to sell.

[19:09] So on the sales call, someone is unqualified.

[19:12] So this depends on your deal flow.

[19:13] But I'm assuming that you've got time to take calls.

[19:15] Yeah, because my time is spread around trying to understand this.

[19:19] We don't help you that.

[19:21] All right.

[19:22] We're going to.

[19:23] This.

[19:24] This will work.

[19:25] When you have these people that are coming to call, what I want to add is before we have the sell the outcomes.

[19:27] So this is kind of like on the call right here beforehand.

[19:30] We're going to add a VSO.

[19:32] Okay.

[19:33] So you're from over the VSO.

[19:34] Yeah.

[19:35] So I was like, do you have one right now?

[19:36] For the course.

[19:37] Yes.

[19:38] So instead, I just need you to make one.

[19:40] Seven minutes.

[19:41] You know, five to seven minutes doesn't need to be long.

[19:43] Just explaining how you do things in your process.

[19:46] Okay.

[19:47] And the other people that you've worked with, some of the six outcomes, reviews, things like that.

[19:51] And then also I had set expectations, which is like on this call we're going to have one of two outcomes.

[19:56] Either you want more personalized attention and we'll, you know, give you the outcome that you want.

[20:00] Or if you're like just starting out,

[20:03] we do have an education thing that if you can't afford our actual services, you can do it on your own.

[20:07] That doesn't sound.

[20:08] Yeah.

[20:09] Now the thing is, is that, you know what, I don't even know if I like that.

[20:12] I'm, I'm deleting, I'm deleting that.

[20:14] Okay.

[20:15] So the VSO is going to sell the services.

[20:17] That's it.

[20:18] When you get on the call, if the person lied about their income or lied about their qualifications,

[20:23] which does happen, then you can immediately triage them and say,

[20:26] Satriage them and like you split and say, you know what, you can tell like this isn't going to be a service to sell for six hours and a hours plus a percentage.

[20:35] Instead, it's going to be, you know, a one time education product sale, then then you can sell that.

[20:41] Now right now you have this 500 and 500.

[20:43] I'm going to wager that you don't, like if you're getting people to buy this in a, on a checkout page,

[20:49] typically you can triple the price with a phone call of the same thing.

[20:53] Okay.

[20:54] So you could probably sell for three grand.

[20:56] So if we're charging six here, I would say probably somewhere in the neighborhood of like two to three K,

[21:02] is the right price point for the education down so.

[21:05] But the only purpose of that is just so that you can maximize your time on the call so that you can still kind of have something.

[21:11] And if you need to do a payment plan or whatever, you know, that's, that's, at that point you're just trying to liquidate your time.

[21:15] But fundamentally, if we were to do this, let's walk through it.

[21:19] It actually looks like now.

[21:20] You have your YouTube videos.

[21:22] Now all of the calls to action, the way I see my YouTube is I have, you know, 2,000 video, whatever how many videos I have.

[21:30] And each of them are basically like little mini ads that are always running.

[21:34] And underneath of the video, the quality ad, I have my actual call to action.

[21:38] And I can, I have this surface area across the whole internet that I can change and redirect all of that traffic from all of my videos to wherever I want.

[21:45] Then you can go back and on your biggest videos, go get pinned comments that, you know,

[21:50] that have the same call to action.

[21:52] It gives some people just read the comments, change your profile,

[21:54] and then going forward in your videos, you put the, the, the CTA towards it to DM me on a Instagram.

[21:59] We're going to completely ignore the site since that's where all of your, all of your sales are having on DM.

[22:03] So let's just push everyone to DM.

[22:04] Now how many followers per month are you getting?

[22:07] I'm getting about 800 per new followers.

[22:10] Guess what?

[22:11] We're going to, okay, so this is thing one thing two is that for every new follower you get,

[22:17] I want you to DM them and say, are you here for free content or entertainment, whatever,

[22:23] entertainment or you want to help.

[22:28] And then every person who says they want help is a lead.

[22:31] So right now, if you think about that, you got 800 new leads a month that you can work.

[22:35] Realistically, you close five percent of those.

[22:39] I mean, it's 40 more sales a month at six K. There's 240.

[22:44] That's just from not including your existing volume,

[22:48] which we're now going to redirect everything to the most efficient monetization model.

[22:52] What stops you from doing this?

[22:53] Nothing.

[22:55] All right, I think this will make you a lot.

[22:58] And I think this will save your business.

[23:00] And I think this will also make you very rich.

[23:02] So we can help more people.

[23:03] Yeah, because you can't help people if you broke.

[23:06] The thing is is that the education, I think long term, long long term,

[23:10] you might end up just giving it away for free,

[23:13] because people are coming from that group as well.

[23:16] I'm assuming.

[23:17] And then they buy your services.

[23:18] And that's why I'm not trying to attack this because this is long term lead nurture for you.

[23:21] Yeah.

[23:22] So it's that.

[23:23] Yeah.

[23:24] Good job.

[23:25] Well, there's your first mistake.

[23:27] I knew it.

[23:28] No, but if you were to do it on school, there's a couple benefits.

[23:33] The biggest one is that we have more active users than any other group platform.

[23:38] And community platform.

[23:40] So like you'll probably just get people coming into your community anyways.

[23:45] But you can also, every single person who gets into the group,

[23:49] you can offer a free onboarding call as a part as a benefit of being in the community.

[23:54] And then you can use those setting calls to either triage them to services or just refer them to free stuff.

[24:00] Right, like instead of coming from YouTube,

[24:02] they would go from the school and then think about like this.

[24:05] This is actually really good visual.

[24:07] So your old way, let's do this in red is Michael of stars.

[24:11] Michael.

[24:12] Michael.

[24:13] So old way is this.

[24:15] You had one source of eyeballs, right?

[24:18] And you were splitting it between three different places.

[24:22] The new way is you now have three different sources of eyeballs in your forcing all of them through the most efficient monetization of the equal.

[24:30] Because you've got your YouTube, you've got your Instagram,

[24:33] and then you've got your group.

[24:35] And all three of those are pushing to the one thing that we know makes you the most money that also people want.

[24:39] And we're pricing it in a way that actually makes you money.

[24:42] And then the question, the question would be,

[24:45] so we would create from the Instagram, from the DM or the WhatsApp,

[24:50] we would create a calendar link, they're golden.

[24:54] They'll get the initial consultation for free.

[24:58] It's going to be clear.

[24:59] It's not a consultation.

[25:01] It's a sales call.

[25:02] Yes.

[25:03] Then from there, once they scale the call, they go to a VSL to prepare them.

[25:10] Yes.

[25:11] And there are expectations and everything.

[25:14] Then on the sales call, we'll identify whether we can sell them our services or if not,

[25:20] down sell them to our course.

[25:23] Exactly.

[25:24] Right.

[25:25] So our core offer is our, the results, right?

[25:28] The outcome.

[25:29] That's our core offer.

[25:30] Yeah.

[25:31] And that outcome, it's based on your specific need and our ability to fulfill that.

[25:36] But we're not saying, when people are coming to us because we're lawyers in the company,

[25:40] we're not going to have to do that.

[25:41] We're not going to have to do that.

[25:42] We're not going to have to do that.

[25:43] We're not going to have to do that.

[25:44] We're not going to have to do that.

[25:46] We're not going to have to do that.

[25:48] We're not going to have to do that.

[25:49] We're not going to have to do that.

[25:50] We're not going to have to do that.

[25:51] We're not going to have to do that.

[25:52] We're not going to have to do that.

[25:53] We're not going to have to do that.

[25:54] We're not going to have to do that.

[25:55] We're not going to have to do that.

[25:56] We're not going to have to do that.

[25:57] We're not going to have to do that.

[25:58] We're not going to have to do that.

[25:59] We're not going to have to do that.

[26:00] We're like, oh, I don't want to pay that percentage.

[26:02] That you can pay it's 25,000.

[26:04] So we'll do 25,000 without the percentage or we'll do 50,800 with the percentage.

[26:08] Got it.

[26:09] And then, uh, do you think that that also gives you a very nice price anchor?

[26:12] Yeah, it makes it makes sense because the percentage right now, the last two deals, the average has been like 40 something.

[26:20] Okay.

[26:21] And the lead magnet would be the cell skull.

[26:25] Yeah, I want to just do this as the easy, like,

[26:28] was the easiest thing that I can do to immediately fix this business and make it profitable.

[26:32] Okay.

[26:33] If we wanted to add something else we could, but I just don't want to write it.

[26:37] Okay.

[26:38] We're going from spraying the traffic all over place into places that lose money,

[26:41] to pointing three different places to the one place that makes money, and doing more of what already works.

[26:46] And we're just going to add a little bit of qualification at a little VSL, fix the pricing,

[26:50] and then we're also going to route all the new followers that come there too.

[26:53] So you're going to have it, you will likely have a lot of opportunities.

[26:57] So you'll likely be taking, far, you know, eight, ten, twelve sales calls a day.

[27:02] Okay.

[27:03] And which is a good thing.

[27:05] It's not in great.

[27:06] And I have three people that can actually do that with me, so if everyone has their own calendar link,

[27:12] as you explain your book then, okay.

[27:15] I have a book on the best selling author in Spanish in this niche.

[27:20] Right.

[27:21] How do you see that fitting in maybe that solid magnet, like giving it out for free like you do?

[27:26] Because they're usually become super fenced like, of course.

[27:29] Yeah.

[27:30] Um, what is that just another?

[27:32] So there's a couple of, so there's, let's say like right off the top of the head,

[27:36] there's two places that we can, like if you wanted to use it now,

[27:39] I would say that you could give to people who are unqualified.

[27:42] If you don't think you could, like if you look at somebody's profile and you don't think they're, they look like,

[27:45] I mean, you can probably tell somebody's not qualified.

[27:47] You could say, hey, it doesn't look like you're ready for all of those services,

[27:51] but because I want to, you know, invest in the relationship long term.

[27:54] Here's a copy of my book.

[27:55] I think that would be a very elegant way to not overly complexify would already,

[27:59] will work.

[28:00] Long term, we could start using it as a, um, a way that we would drive traffic in the future.

[28:06] And then you can have a call team call the people who bought the book.

[28:09] And then see if they're, you know, they want more help.

[28:11] And then you could basically bring, it would just, we'd, all we would do is we add is another whole.

[28:15] But right now you have three more than sufficient traffic sources that you were just wildly under monetizing.

[28:21] And we just need to fix that.

[28:22] Okay.

[28:23] And the last question would be, um, on the software side,

[28:28] because the product roadmap is almost finished entirely with all of the features that the companies are looking for.

[28:36] Yeah.

[28:37] If I'm not investing any energies on that, I want to know,

[28:41] I don't know.

[28:42] I'll believe that.

[28:43] I want to see it.

[28:44] Okay.

[28:45] So if I'm supposed I'm not spending energy in a world that doesn't exist.

[28:48] Yeah.

[28:49] In fantasy land is there a way that we can create like a sunset period where we would say,

[28:55] Okay, I'm going to give the team X amount of time to roll out all of the features that this company is that are saying,

[29:02] I want to use it.

[29:03] I'm going to pay for it.

[29:04] Yeah.

[29:05] You know, 15, 25,000 dollars per year for the software.

[29:07] Mm-hmm.

[29:08] Is there a way to create that while we're focusing on this?

[29:11] So the very beginning, you know, I said, like, what do you, what do you want?

[29:14] Mm-hmm.

[29:15] And so we had to fix making this make money because you're going to run out of money.

[29:18] Yes.

[29:19] And so we have to solve that.

[29:21] The thing that makes me hesitate with the software is the amount of work in the amount of expertise it takes to make software really work is really high.

[29:30] Mm-hmm.

[29:31] And so I would be more inclined to say, like, if you have some of these big companies, you might just give them the software.

[29:37] We'll have them just say like, you're like, hey, essentially 5,000 year, if you just pay me a hundred grand or pay me 200 grand, I'll just give you the whole thing.

[29:43] And that's basically you getting it cost and saving two years.

[29:47] And then you could focus on this.

[29:48] Okay.

[29:49] That's of course if you want to make money.

[29:51] Of course.

[29:52] No, no, no.

[29:53] I understand that you just want to have like the different scenarios.

[29:56] Yeah.

[29:57] I mean, the alternative scenarios that you burn the education, you burn the services to the ground you go all in on the software.

[30:01] And you need to be able to fund that loss for a while and then actually build it right.

[30:07] No.

[30:08] And that doesn't seem like it's a, it's too more fantasy than reality.

[30:11] Mm-hmm.

[30:12] And then you burn the ton of lessons, which is fine.

[30:14] Everybody just gets better from learning and you build a really good business, which I think you have all the making.

[30:19] You literally have everything in place.

[30:20] They were just organized wrong.

[30:21] That's the good news is like, we don't have to build anything.

[30:23] We just have to take what we already had.

[30:25] Mm-hmm.

[30:26] Read a rectet through a better monetization vehicle.

[30:28] And that's it.

[30:29] And so you like this is the first step.

[30:31] We add traffic here as the second step.

[30:34] And then we'll add the book as the third step later.

[30:36] But for now, you just need to step one step to step.

[30:38] We have enough leads to probably fill up your calendar.

[30:41] Your calendar plus one other person may be too.

[30:44] And if you have three people selling full time and you have a $6,000 thing, you could be at $18,000 today,

[30:49] $30,000 today, $50,000 today.

[30:52] And the next problem that's going to hit you is that you're not going to have the team to actually deliver on this stuff, which will cross later.

[30:57] But that's what this is going to do.

[30:58] This is going to break the business.

[31:00] But you'll be making money.

[31:02] And then we'll take that money that we're making and then we'll solve the thing that's broken, which is that we're going to hire more.

[31:07] So we're getting this advantage for work.

[31:09] We're doing it right.

[31:11] I'm giving you a little Puerto Rican Spanish there.

[31:13] Puerto Rican, you're right.

[31:15] So our constraint right now on your framework, the scaling workshop.

[31:19] Yeah, it's demand.

[31:20] It's demand.

[31:21] Yeah.

[31:22] Because we're not only starting a stopping, but also we're not directing them through the proper channels.

[31:28] And you were mispressed.

[31:29] So I have my little moniker for the six big mistakes that small business owners make.

[31:35] So let's make those in red.

[31:37] And I think you're making almost all of them, which is great.

[31:40] There are good things.

[31:41] It's only up from here.

[31:42] Yeah.

[31:43] So you were selling to too many different avatars.

[31:45] So let's number one.

[31:46] Focus, which is that you had more than one business.

[31:49] So you were hitting that one.

[31:51] You're hitting this one.

[31:53] You weren't.

[31:55] So over expansion, which I will not say that you were wrong.

[31:58] So we put it under focus.

[31:59] I'll give you a neutral on that one.

[32:01] Put it there to be aware.

[32:03] Uh-huh.

[32:04] Then we have compensation.

[32:05] So we have our RU overpaying your people, which right now I don't get that impression.

[32:09] Underpriced, which you were, or mispriced.

[32:11] So you had that one.

[32:12] And then this one is single product.

[32:14] So that's one of somebody has a front and a back end.

[32:17] Which I'll say that you had kind of like a half issue.

[32:19] We had the the $250, you know, power service fee.

[32:23] But we didn't have that kind of percentage when right yet.

[32:25] And it wasn't part of a standard offer.

[32:27] So I'll say that you had like a half a little X, a little miniex.

[32:30] Okay.

[32:31] But the good news is that these are the mistakes that most small business owners make.

[32:35] And it's normal.

[32:36] And it's okay.

[32:37] And that's why we're fixing it.

[32:38] And the next phase, to have a timeline, or at least to be aware of our next phase,

[32:44] would be do this until we get to a million per month.

[32:48] Is that your, I don't know if you get to a million a month from this.

[32:51] You will certainly make a lot more than you are now.

[32:53] And the next thing that's going to break is you're going to run out of words.

[32:57] So the next issue you're going to run into is supply constraint.

[33:00] I actually think you have probably more demand.

[33:02] Like you will not be able to sell through the demand that you already have without expanding supply.

[33:07] But if we completely utilize your existing supply of, you know, work that you could do at the appropriate price,

[33:13] you could actually make this into a multi-million dollar period.

[33:16] Yeah, it's just becoming a lot firm, you know, bigger and lower.

[33:20] Yeah, and a specialized offer, which is good.

[33:22] So you have that in your down.

[33:23] You have a very specific niche.

[33:24] And there's nice things that there's a lot of people who want this service.

[33:27] And the price point that we're charging is an appropriate price for somebody who's, you know,

[33:31] wanting to make a bet on themselves and they're clear.

[33:33] You have to make an investment just like you do.

[33:35] They have to make an investment too.

[33:36] Yeah.

[33:37] And that number is that the $5,000 is that for any type of outcome.

[33:42] No, so I mean, you'll know this better than I do.

[33:46] Okay.

[33:47] But I just want to make sure that, you know,

[33:49] Do you have a rich ticket?

[33:50] I want to make sure that I'm running at at least 80% gross margins for service.

[33:55] Okay.

[33:56] So you're actual cost.

[33:58] So you're actual cost on this.

[34:00] Should be, let's see, should, you should be less than,

[34:03] Call like $1200 bucks or let's say $100.

[34:05] So if you're less than $1100 in terms of total cost,

[34:08] For the liver that to deliver that,

[34:10] Then you can then you charge 50%.

[34:12] And so I'm guessing your man hours are going to cost you less.

[34:15] I mean, I don't know what you pay your,

[34:17] Your lawyers will say it's $100 now or if it's less than 11 hours to do it,

[34:20] And you're going to go.

[34:21] And if they do it in five, amazing.

[34:24] Okay. So if I've had the cost, for example,

[34:27] A lawyer calls me X amount per month.

[34:29] Now I know that I need to be making five times more.

[34:33] Five times more.

[34:34] Okay.

[34:35] And that may sound crazy to anybody who's listening to this,

[34:37] who doesn't have a business, but let me show you this one.

[34:40] So good.

[34:41] So good.

[34:42] This is great.

[34:43] People say that, but listen to me,

[34:44] I have $100 a revenue, right?

[34:46] You was simple.

[34:47] If you have a 20% gross, sorry,

[34:50] 20% cost, but 80% gross margin business.

[34:52] And it's like cool.

[34:53] So we already have $20 going.

[34:55] So we have $80 left.

[34:57] But we're still going to have marketing that we got to spend.

[35:00] We're here to stop admin costs of, you know,

[35:03] People who are scheduling and all that stuff.

[35:05] We have sales that we're going to have to pay on top of that.

[35:08] And that's going to be the majority for this business,

[35:10] because the labor is going to be here,

[35:12] right, in terms of your cost to goods.

[35:14] And so maybe all of these things cost, you know,

[35:17] 60%.

[35:18] Right.

[35:19] So then we still have a 20% margin in the business.

[35:21] But that sounds greedy when you're like, oh my God,

[35:23] there's 80.

[35:24] It's like, yeah, but we got to do all the other costs of the 80.

[35:26] And then whatever's left is our profit.

[35:28] Now hopefully you can run this thing at 30, right?

[35:31] And then you have a 50% margin here,

[35:33] which would be wonderful.

[35:34] And then we smile.

[35:35] Mm-hmm.

[35:36] Got it.

[35:37] So all in all, we went from sad face to smiley face.

[35:41] Did it?

[35:42] Great.

[35:43] I was aware that services was the play.

[35:47] Mm-hmm.

[35:48] When we focus on services this year,

[35:50] and we're already making way more money.

[35:53] But that was, you already have to.

[00:00] You know a lot of shit and like you've clearly package this in really easy

[00:03] down to stay at a ways.

[00:04] It's almost exhausting listening because it's like every it's like when you read

[00:07] a really good historical book or something it's like every sentence is packed

[00:10] with a fact.

[00:12] You seem like a grinder when you're building these businesses where you just

[00:16] like doing 80 hour hundred hour work weeks and what about now because you're

[00:20] like you're you're a huge you're like a bodybuilder.

[00:23] So so like how did you balance like being fit and get married and you

[00:27] but I don't know you well but you seem like you'd be grinding hard.

[00:30] So my wife works in the business with me.

[00:32] So we are true 50 50 partners like it's very rare.

[00:35] I like I recognize how rare it is.

[00:36] She actually is 100% matched with me and like she just as much be on this call

[00:41] because she runs the other half like she for a work standpoint.

[00:44] She has more output than I did.

[00:45] She is the operator.

[00:46] So she builds the infrastructure.

[00:47] She does the recruiting.

[00:48] She says that they are they are stuff.

[00:50] She does the culture.

[00:51] She like she does I mean she runs everything.

[00:53] I just you know occasionally come up with a good idea and try and stick with it long

[00:57] enough to see it come true.

[00:59] But in terms of grinding like I love business I love this and there's nothing that really

[01:04] stimulates me like this and so I do as much of it as I can and if we want to go

[01:09] out to dinner you know but like worst work I was a single single so it all kids and so

[01:13] we work from like fiveish to four and then you know usually in the middle of the day

[01:18] we probably go to the gym for an hour or two and then come back and keep working and

[01:22] go out to dinner and that's kind of our lives.

[01:24] You see pretty um this isn't I would say I'm a little bit I'm definitely this Sean has a

[01:29] little bit of a two like manics not the right word but like neurotic maybe is a better

[01:34] word where it's like there's something that's deep rooted inside of you it's not like

[01:40] you want to do something necessarily it feels like you're it's more compulsive or obsess

[01:44] you have assessed about stuff which I am as well.

[01:46] If that's true what's that rooted in what are you trying to get done.

[01:49] So I think originally the drive was from just crippling insecurity and needing approval

[01:54] right and then I think from like a behavioral conditioning standpoint I got a media feedback

[02:00] that was positive and then I was conditioned to continue those actions.

[02:03] Now I continue to do that without the original catalyst that got them going to begin with.

[02:07] I don't think I suffer you know from the insecurities as much as I used to I'd say

[02:12] I'm probably 30% better than I was at the beginning and it might just be because I have

[02:16] this massive big pile of money that I can use as an emotional approach to why I'm not a

[02:19] piece of shit.

[02:20] That would help.

[02:21] I'm just being like I mean in the film world this is pure I'd find out how much actual

[02:25] growth I had or if I just compensated by circumstance and you know, compensate for

[02:28] divisions.

[02:29] You can stand it to me and we'll find out we'll see.

[02:32] I just wonder to you.

[02:33] I'd like so there's the compulsion and like this last year I pretty much took off.

[02:38] I get it not worked that much and so I saw the difference and I have come to accept that I love

[02:43] working and I don't need to judge myself for that or or take in other people's judgment

[02:48] on how much I should quote do like this is my life and this is what I like doing and

[02:54] their ideals that they've arbitrarily made up as what they define as balance are irrelevant

[02:59] today.

[03:00] You said you took last year off what'd you do what you get up to?

[03:03] We traveled a lot.

[03:05] Went to combo, went to Scott's there, went to Sedona, went to Flagstaff, traveled all over,

[03:11] now felt honestly pretty empty like you can only eat so many times like there's just not

[03:15] a lot to do.

[03:16] It feels good having that rest though.

[03:18] Like you can't be in the trenches I think rather you need breaks from being at war.

[03:21] I think it may be even phrasing it.

[03:24] Number three in South are like phrasing it is instead of like a break as a shift in how

[03:27] you're thinking because like it's going from dirt to clouds but I still think it's high leverage

[03:31] activity.

[03:32] You know what I mean?

[03:33] Like I'll put it's just a different type of output.

[03:35] You said something on one of your videos that you're one of the only other people that I

[03:39] have heard say this phrase I use it a lot which is yeah I had a season like are this season

[03:43] I'm doing this or I had a season where I was really just focusing on X and that's been

[03:48] like a game changer for me my personal trainer and kind of coach.

[03:51] She's like my mindset goes plus trainer.

[03:53] He does this all the time where he's like I'm in a season right now where I'm just he'll

[03:58] be like you know I'm practicing not waiting and he's like he comes up with these little

[04:01] themes or he'll be like right now I'm in a season where I'm going to eat whatever I want

[04:05] and it's kind of like in the entrepreneur world like time boxing.

[04:08] All right I'm going to give myself two hours to get this shit to done I'm going to launch

[04:11] in the next two weeks no matter what right like we've used time boxing for productivity

[04:14] and now this season's thing it makes every like decision you're making less heavy of a

[04:19] commit because you're like it's okay.

[04:21] Yeah there's beginnings and ends and this season is going to feel a little different

[04:25] just like winter feels different than summer.

[04:27] That's how I use it.

[04:28] Do you use it like that?

[04:29] I just noticed you said that phrase.

[04:31] On a person.

[04:32] Yeah I mean I think about in terms of entrepreneurial seasons and at least for me might have

[04:36] been like five year chunks.

[04:37] And so this is going to be my fourth season and they've roughly been about the same length.

[04:41] So I think that it probably takes me like three-ish years to like really see something

[04:45] through and then two years to figure out how I'm going to transition from that thing or

[04:50] realize or monitor whatever that's right it's kind of like a PE cycle and most.

[04:54] Give us kind of like give us an example of normal like here's the default way people

[05:00] are doing something and here's the refraise of the refram that has better results.

[05:05] I would love to get two minutes of learning sales from Alice.

[05:08] Sure.

[05:09] So as my belief if you look at Bellford you look at Bradley you look at Grant Cardone some

[05:12] of the big sales trainers that are out there almost all of them invariably have the same

[05:15] story which I started selling and was the best guy on the team by fucking mile and then

[05:19] I tried to figure out what I was doing.

[05:21] And so I do think that some people naturally based on their childhood or their offerings

[05:26] there would ever or just have a higher proclivity for selling.

[05:28] We'd care to get to get to Gab and and and yeah and I think it carries over into how

[05:34] you recruit for selling too because we built a lot of sales teams and I actually have a very

[05:37] short allowing for people to fail at sales cycle probably much shorter than most people

[05:42] and it's just because I've never had a killer sales person who didn't do pretty well the

[05:46] first week and so for me we you know we turned through this quickly but as a result of that

[05:50] the team is just killers and they know that in terms of sales stuff I think people don't

[05:55] know how people are really freaked out about the idea of selling and the front part of that

[05:59] is that I do think that the number one predictor of good sales is conviction.

[06:03] Fundamentally you have one person who should believe in something another person who does not believe

[06:07] it yet and trust is the thing that transfers that conviction.

[06:10] So if fundamentally there's the two things you need you need trust and you can

[06:13] picture.

[06:14] Most times salespeople don't have 100% trust as a 100% conviction and so the also the idea

[06:19] of conviction as a binary is false so it's not like I believe it or I don't believe

[06:22] it is to what extent to I believe right and so that's why like in terms of if I

[06:26] wouldn't improve a sales team I can do the drills which we do that's like blocking tackling

[06:30] but the thing that really juices the sales team is hearing the testimonies of the people

[06:33] that they sold last week and what they're doing today and how their lives have changed and so

[06:37] I noticed this because on my sales teams when we were in person whenever I did way out day

[06:41] which is when everyone finished their challenges and everybody was crying and so excited

[06:44] I tried to stack as many sales points as I could while people were weighing out and during

[06:49] those days we closed like 100% because people were like dude how can you not think this works

[06:53] it's right there and so the thing is is like you can either trick yourself into having the right

[06:57] tone or you can train yourself and I think that it's much easier to trick yourself into it

[07:02] by just simply believing because if you talk if you truly believe in the product you will talk

[07:06] about it differently and so in terms of an understanding of selling if you need to have conviction

[07:11] you need to have trust trust is going to come from expertise and so the love of rapport right

[07:16] I think that over arching late to help someone sell we just have to ask the right questions to get

[07:20] someone to come with the conclusion on their own and so most sales conversations follow more

[07:24] or less the same framework if you know what you're doing otherwise people are just chasing their

[07:28] tail and trying to chase a prospect to an outcome that that prospect doesn't know how like

[07:32] we've had this conversation a hundred times they have only had it once we should be the one

[07:36] knowing how this conversation is supposed to go right we should also come in with a massive advantage

[07:40] to how to have this conversation go the way we want to because we do it on a fucking day right

[07:44] and so big front-end pieces is like why are they there what's the problem what have they done so far

[07:50] understanding where they failed seeing why our product is different from the things that they failed

[07:54] asking for permission to explain about the product explaining the product not in any way based on

[08:00] features but only based on the experiences that they will have as a result of it and using

[08:03] analogies to explain those experiences and then having a close at the end which the the

[08:08] TikTok I think that you he references like a no-based close and I've got a lot of natural sales people

[08:13] do this anyways like if I want something I'm like hey can you do this for me I'm like hey

[08:17] would you mind and they say no they don't have a right like this natural communication dynamics

[08:21] that most people naturally know how to persuade people or at least influence do that on their own

[08:25] this is just retroactively looking at and saying what did I do different like why is this different

[08:29] in terms of like overcoming because people are afraid of confrontation right that's what they're

[08:33] afraid of and so I believe that you can solve out ever having confrontation and you can do that with

[08:38] what I like to call child let curiosity and so if someone says well my husband's not going to

[08:43] approve that like I wouldn't be like huh that's so interesting telling more about that rather than like

[08:49] all right let's like you're husband and asshole like that's not going to work because in arguments

[08:53] known wins right and so like why why would you think that because because I would think that he wants

[08:58] what's best for you right yeah he wants what's best does he know you're struggling with this right

[09:01] now well I mean yeah he knows what's struggling with it okay so he wants a special he knows you're

[09:05] struggling with it so why do you think he would be opposed of solving something that you're currently

[09:08] struggling with just don't understand would he be happier if you continue to struggle oh no it's like

[09:13] will break then would you be opposed to moving forward today and that way and hey if you go home to

[09:17] your husband then you make a joke and the lightest scenario and then you close it right and so it's

[09:21] I think childlike curiosity is the immediate that you have to train because people get defensive

[09:26] so that is one thing that like fighters talk about when they're in the ring like in the beginning

[09:30] you breathe into much right I don't know if you like if you've been like sparring itself like you

[09:34] breathe in you breathe too much you hyperventilate and so the guys who've done it enough they slow down

[09:39] the breathing because when they get things get intense they can slow it down and so I think sales is a

[09:43] lot the same way where you're like your adrenaline kicks in sharp breathing faster it's spider fly

[09:46] so you gotta be able to slow it down and be like huh that's crazy I want to thought that okay

[09:50] tell me more about that and like you know you're interested and then they don't feel like you're

[09:54] combating them they feel like you genuinely are interested and want to help them which is what

[09:59] you should be doing because you should be so damn dude only if it makes sense but you are full of

[10:04] like interesting insights and like you know a lot of shit and like you've clearly packaged

[10:09] it really easy to understand ways it's almost exhausting listening because it's like every

[10:13] it's like when you read a really good historical book or something it's like every sentence is packed

[10:17] with a fact yeah and it's like oh my gosh like I gotta you know what I'm trying to do

[10:20] I'm trying to do that all the time I was like exhausting this is awesome

[10:23] most of the nation if you enjoyed that video smash the subscribe button hit the little notification bell

[10:28] the reason for that is because I don't actually have a cadence when I make these videos so if you want

[10:30] to make sure you don't miss the next one that comes out go subscribe notify and I'll see you the next one

[10:35] bye!

[00:00] I would rather have a solution that I can get 90% of the marketplace to get an 80% win,

[00:06] rather than have five percent of the marketplace to get a hundred percent win.

[00:09] I slept like a chairb, which is a small angel baby last night, my gosh, I feel like an human being.

[00:16] And so I wanted to bring you a question that lay last me yesterday and I thought that would be a good podcast topic.

[00:23] She was like, what would you actually do? Like right now? You're like, well, like if you had,

[00:27] if you were, you know, roll back to time clock and this has happened when we had R6, Jim's like,

[00:32] what would your actual, what would you do to approach this and what would you play to it?

[00:37] And so I want to, I want to first just at least say with my big disclaimer here is that

[00:42] something that I don't discuss a lot, but I think it's worth mentioning is that the advice that I give

[00:48] in general, I try to cater to the audience that I'm speaking to.

[00:53] If I ran a Jim, I would probably run it somewhat differently than what we espouse.

[00:58] And that is because I am not you and you are not me. And so I would rather have a solution that I can get

[01:06] 90% of the marketplace to get an 80% win, rather than have five percent of the marketplace get a hundred percent win.

[01:13] And I've run my business that way and I think that is why we've been

[01:16] really successful is because it's the same thing with a weight loss program. Like if I can get,

[01:21] if I could get 90% of people to have a great result, rather than 10% of people to have a crazy,

[01:30] crazy result, then I would rather serve the 90. Elon Musk even talks about this. He's like, I'd rather do

[01:37] a good amount for a ton of people rather than a lot for a very small amount. And so we've

[01:41] taken the same approach in terms of how we, when we make offers, all my focus is how can I make

[01:47] the best offer that anyone can sell? How can I make a sales process? It's so easy. Anyone could do it.

[01:52] Not necessarily like for me, I'd be selling hats that could over the phone all day long. But a

[01:57] very small segment could actually do that successfully at scale. So that's my first disclaimer.

[02:04] Now that being said, this is exactly what I would do. If my Jim's were in the midst of this

[02:11] COVID stuff. So first off, I would get out of the leases that I have. Now, independent of,

[02:21] because there's some people were like, whoa, we're going to get out of this scenario. There's

[02:24] there. I have no idea. But what I know is just opportunity. If I have the opportunity to flip

[02:30] my facilities in an environment where I'm being encouraged by both government and my clients

[02:36] to make the flip and remain open, then I'm going to take that opportunity and flip to a

[02:42] more profitable model. We're being given permission in this instance to do that with the zero

[02:47] repercussions that's even being encouraged. And so the first thing is I would take all six. I

[02:51] have my recurring base of members and I would flip them to remote. Now then I would try and cut

[02:58] all of the rent for each of those locations. Maybe even get out of the lease. I would likely

[03:03] just try and negotiate three, six months if we rent see how it shakes out. But likely,

[03:08] this is what I'm saying. I would do. You don't need to do this. This is how I would play my cards.

[03:15] And so what happened is let's say each of those Jim's at 30,000 a month, right?

[03:20] In Recurrent. Just EFT is not for an encast flow, nothing else. They're doing 30,000 months. Cool.

[03:26] So now I've got 180,000 a month that I have in Recurrent. Now let's be realistic. Let's say 25

[03:32] percent of this people drop off because it's not an owner operated facility. I've got staff. They

[03:36] don't care as much. They're not rubbing belly, some kissing babies the way I would if I were at a single

[03:40] location. And so let's say at least 25 percent. So that means I lose roughly, you know, 45,000 off that.

[03:47] I think. No. 40. Yeah. 40-ish. Right. So at least 40,000 off that's now down to like 140-ish or 135.

[03:58] Per month, that's my recurring none. Okay. There's a lot of cash there. All right. Then I would take my

[04:03] best trainer at each facility. The guy, the guy or gal who cared the most, who is the most engaged

[04:09] with members, who is the most upbeat, the most positive, and truly cared about keeping them.

[04:14] And I might have to take two at each facility if there's too many for one person to handle. That's fine.

[04:19] The rest of my personnel would be considered non-essential because in this new model, they would not

[04:24] be able to provide value. All right. That's what I would do. All right. So I've got, let's say we got six.

[04:28] It means I've got 12 staff that I'm keeping on to maintain 135,000 dollars in recurring revenue

[04:35] per month. Now let's say it conservatively, I pay each of these people $3,000 a month. Right. To stay at home.

[04:41] Now that's a great for some of these guys that might actually be a big paid jump from what they were doing in

[04:45] person. Cool. So another making 3000 months staying home to just provide accountability. All right.

[04:53] That is it. So big, big thing here, not like a gym lunch, what we're doing is we have

[04:59] we just, so I'm kicking this off today, starting a Monday, we're running 16 remote workouts per

[05:05] day. Basically every hour during the normal workday, there's going to be a class that's being held.

[05:11] And that way, all of our gyms can cut their overhead and just have all of those workouts as

[05:16] fulfillment for their online clients. Right. And so now they don't even have to staff that stuff.

[05:20] It's already been taken care of centrally. My all of us all of our gyms can participate that

[05:23] cut their overhead even further. Right. Now, rewank back to the six gyms. So step one, I'm going to

[05:29] get out of the leases that I can because because right now, you have a pretty good opportunity to

[05:33] be able to break leases and you're at the very least get three, six months of free rent right now.

[05:39] So that's one. Two, I would flip my recurring revenue into remote, which would be nutrition

[05:46] in accountability primarily. I have the workouts that are being done. If I have 12 trainers,

[05:51] I can say each of you guys are response for one workout a day. That's it. That's one every hour.

[05:55] And that allows all of my people to participate in a session at any given time. But it's not

[06:00] that hard because you can do it from home. Right. And the whole point is that like, I'd love to say

[06:04] it's going to be from the gym, but reality if you're getting quarantined, you might not be able to even go

[06:08] to the gym. So, and most of the clients are going to be consuming this from their homes. And so it

[06:11] makes this to have a trainer that's from not a big deal. So that's that's what I have on the workout

[06:16] part. Big, big caveat here. No one cares about the workouts. If you're selling over the phone,

[06:21] you can get workout apps online, you know, like, you know, beach body and kill it. It seems

[06:26] got a sweatout. Like, there's all these other apps that are like 10 to 20 dollars a month that have

[06:30] probably better already pre-existing stuff. So you're not going to win on the workout front, right?

[06:35] You're going to win on the accountability and the service. That's how we've always won and that's how

[06:39] we need to keep like, remember the rules haven't changed. Your workouts never matter. They don't

[06:43] matter now. Right? What matters is the relationship that you have these people that they feel like

[06:47] someone is checking in on them. Right? They pay for you to pay attention. That's how it works.

[06:52] All right. So I have my 12 trainers. Let's say I said I'm paying them 3,000 a month. So I'm paying

[06:56] 36,000 a month and overhead for those trainers. Right? And the only thing they have to do every day is

[07:01] one workout and then reach us to the customer. So make sure that they are being taken care of,

[07:07] making sure that their head space is good, making sure that they're not going to the pantry

[07:10] and rating it and getting cookies every day, making sure that they attend one of the workouts.

[07:14] That's what they do all day now. That's it. It's all they have to do. All right. Now overnight,

[07:18] by doing this, I have 100,000 a month that's left over in all profit. Holy smokes. That's a

[07:28] pretty good deal. But wait. Now what do I do with my time? Right? So my time would be focused.

[07:34] The other thing that I would ask them to do is I would dedicate their first two hours of the

[07:40] day every day to doing 100 cold reachouts. All right. They want to pay for themselves. Cool.

[07:45] 100 cold reachouts. What you do is if you have someone who's interested, you book them on my

[07:50] calendar offloads. All right. So I'm going to film my day with appointments that my team, my 12

[07:57] people doing reachouts are going to set for me. All right. And then I'm going to close beyond that.

[08:03] I'm going to start turning on cold traffic and I'm going to run because right now

[08:07] in this hypothetical environment, which is the real environment currently,

[08:10] lead costs are like 50% to 75% off. It's nuts. Right. I've never seen anything like this. It's crazy.

[08:17] And so we would be scheduling phone calls to sell. And so my trainer's day looks like this.

[08:23] First two hours of the day. All they're doing is doing cold reachouts. They get their daily 100

[08:27] day. You give me 100 reachouts. That's what you owe me. All right. Get me one schedule the day.

[08:31] I don't care. Just get me one schedule the day. All right. What are they going to say? They're going

[08:35] to say, hey, name. Do you know anybody who's trying to stay in shape during the quarantine who

[08:40] doesn't want to get, make turn their sweatpants into yoga pants by the end of this. Ha. Right.

[08:45] Whatever. Now when you say that, all of a sudden, the people who are responding are like,

[08:48] oh, this person's not fishing, they're asking genuinely if I know anybody. Right. And then

[08:52] now more than ever, people have a lot of goodwill that they want to help out other small businesses.

[08:55] I was like, that is definitely the zeitgeist of this moment. So I guess the German word for the

[08:59] general vibe of the era. Anyway, so people are trying to help out small businesses. So if you're asking

[09:04] like that, you're not even soliciting them. You're just saying, hey, do you know anybody? And a lot of

[09:07] something like, you know, I'm trying to, I'm trying to lose weight. Perfect. Our game weight. Perfect.

[09:11] Let's get you booked for a call. We have a totally remote thing to make sure that you stay healthy

[09:14] etc. Right. So the first two hours they're doing the daily reachouts, then they're doing all the

[09:19] reachouts to their existing customers that they're maintaining. Right. And then one hour of the day,

[09:23] they're required to do their workout. Now most of the time, you want to have your trainers

[09:27] to work out any ways at home. So it's like just record it, like have fun with it. Right. And then that

[09:32] way, all of my people can actually have more sessions than they ever had in person. So I'm adding

[09:36] values and from what I used to have. They have more availability that we're at. They have more variety

[09:41] because they probably have access to trainers that they couldn't have had access to before. All right.

[09:44] And it's also my best coaches. So it's like, you know, we all know we have a got a couple of coaches

[09:49] who run stuff. And if somebody uses news coming in, you probably want to put them with Jessica

[09:53] and not Eric, right? And like Jessica's awesome. Don't put in Eric's as your first session.

[09:57] Right. Maybe maybe save that for some of the later people who already like us. Right. So those are the

[10:01] trainers. We're going to be getting those at home workouts. Big picture again, bigger-minded,

[10:05] known cares. Right. No, not cares about the workouts they only care about the capability. All right.

[10:09] So if I flip my gyms, right, I renegotiate my leases. I push them out where I break them. I take my

[10:15] recurring. I would get into 100% remote. I would let go of not essentially personal or not,

[10:19] who are not generating revenue or keeping revenue through fulfillment. Right. They're generating

[10:24] revenue in their first two hours a day by getting new calls. The rest of their day, they're focused

[10:28] on doing the fulfillment for the clients that they already have and maintaining that EFT and recurring.

[10:33] They're feeling back to the bucket because I'm going to be doing the sales because in a time of

[10:37] strife, I'm going to do what I need to do best and make it rain. Right. And so the people

[10:42] are not going to be able to succeed. The ones you don't want to roll if their sleeves are not

[10:44] getting dirty. If you're the best salesman at your gym, then you should sell. That's what you should

[10:47] be doing. Right. And then they do their one workout a day. So that's all I have to train. There's

[10:52] that for you. Three things. Reachouts to get new customers. Reachouts to exist in customers, make sure

[10:57] they know we're paying attention. And then finally, that they're doing one workout a day, which

[11:01] they should be doing for themselves. Anyways, they're just going to record it. Awesome. Boxes

[11:04] checks. All right. My day is going to be making sure that we're marketing and filling the bucket

[11:08] up back up. All right. That's it. That's my day. All right. So I'm marketing and taking sales calls.

[11:13] I'm taking sales calls from Patreon. I'm taking sales calls from from outbound. I'm taking sales calls

[11:17] all day long. That is what my job is to make it rain and feed the machine. All right. That is what

[11:22] I would have done. If I had been in that situation or in this situation, I'm not necessarily saying

[11:28] you do that. I'm telling you what I would have done. And that would be the play that I would do because

[11:33] it would give me permission to overnight transform six facilities into one massive recurring

[11:39] revenue stream that's 100% remote as high as high a high profit margin off of the moment.

[11:45] And I would say what I said yesterday, but I would say to again, so hopefully it sinks in,

[11:48] is that just because this has changed does not mean it's bad. Right. Eight months ago, I walked

[11:53] through all the math about why having a remote filament is a better solution. There's a reason

[11:57] people are going online. Right. There are better margins. Right. There are. The thing is,

[12:02] is that a lot of people feel like for some reason that that was bad. That's okay. But now people are

[12:07] being forced to do it. Doesn't mean it's bad. It actually makes more money and now we're getting

[12:10] permission from the government and from society to do this for ourselves. So I would take that opportunity

[12:17] and run with it. So that's my recommendation. That's what I would have done. You can take that

[12:22] for what you will, but that is exactly what I would have done step by step. That's how it would have

[12:26] broken out my trainers. That's what I would have done with my overhead. That's what I would have

[12:29] redefined their proper spots. Build these as and then beyond just lead them through the crisis.

[12:34] I would also try and paint a vision for a better future. It's like guys, you like in this,

[12:38] you stay on that home, you can work out whatever you want. You're just actually getting people

[12:43] good results because we're making sure that they're just staying accountable and they need us the most.

[12:46] Right. And one small note that I want to add to this, when you're selling or when you're talking

[12:53] to customers, everyone right now is at the airport. So if you've noticed, everyone the airport

[12:57] is always just like immediately a three out of ten, three out of five stressed. Right. They're already

[13:02] at six out of ten stress levels. What people want is to feel good. All right. And so that's

[13:09] going to. And so when you get on the phone, if you want to sell, right, you got to make them feel

[13:13] good. Like the fundamentals have not changed. It's just you got a little bit more resistance when

[13:18] you're starting because they're already at a negative point. They're not at neutral. Most people

[13:23] are not going to be a little bit negative because they're quarantined. They got their kids around.

[13:25] They feel like shit. They're smelly. They feel sloppy and bloated because they're eating cookies all

[13:30] like. Right. And, you know, they're uncertain about the future. What they want from you, what you're

[13:35] employees want from you, what your clients want from you, and what your prospects when you get on the

[13:39] phone with them want from you is one word. Hope. All right. So you have to be the hopeless mother

[13:45] fucker that exists. All right. And the way that you have hope is that you have optimism about what

[13:50] you are willing to do to endure. And as long as you know that you're willing to endure just about

[13:56] anything to get through this, then you have confidence and certainty in the fact that you will get through

[14:01] this. And you can convey that conviction to your prospects, to your team, and to your customers.

[14:09] Because that's what they're going to want. Like right now, therapy is blowing up. Life coaching's

[14:13] blowing up in terms of like growth. Tons of people on life coaches. Tons of people want therapist

[14:18] right up because they're stressed out of their minds. And so if you're looking for more ways to

[14:22] provide value, someone will buy after how you've made them feel from the first 15 minutes of the phone

[14:28] call. The first 15 minutes is just like caring about them, throwing them some love, making them

[14:34] feel good about like, hey, we're going to get through this. No worries, right? They want to be around

[14:38] more of that. They want more of that feeling. The fact that you're going to sell them weight loss,

[14:42] and that's going to be the vehicle that you monetize is almost secondary to how you will make

[14:47] them feel in that moment because they're just going to want to feel more of that. And so that goes

[14:51] for your trainers, reminding them dude, like we're trying to make people feel good right now.

[14:55] All right, we're trying to get people through this. Like if we can get them to put down the cookies

[14:58] and move a little bit, they're probably going to feel better. And if that's what our value is

[15:02] right now, then that's what it's going to be. All right. So that is what I would do step by step.

[15:06] If I had my gym drink covered right now, I make no recommendations. You are all grown as individuals.

[15:10] I make your own decisions for yourself. But that is what I would do. So anyways, hope you have an

[15:15] amazing Wednesday. Keep rocking. You can't make it through this. You just got to want it. All right,

[15:20] lots of love. Catch you guys soon. Bye.

[00:00] Now some people have said that my approach review on friendships is transactional, extreme, whatever.

[00:10] And I'll say, sure, you're right. And I don't see friendship as a binary term, meaning.

[00:18] It's not that we are friends or not friends, it's how good a friend's are we. To define friendship,

[00:23] the opposite friend would be an enemy or a rival, someone who doesn't root for me, they actively try

[00:27] and destroy my efforts, they try and get me to be emotional rather than make logical decisions.

[00:34] And they try and distract me from my ultimate goal and for many of you, some of your friends fit that description.

[00:39] Now, I understand that people are human and people make mistakes.

[00:43] But if you want the one strike, not three strike, one way ticket out of my friendship,

[00:48] you only have to do one thing. You have to not root for me, meaning you actively resent

[00:53] either explicitly or implicitly when I win. If you resent me winning, why are you here?

[00:58] Like, the reason they're still there is because there's a chance that your success will benefit them.

[01:02] But while you're succeeding, they'll still try and destroy it in case they can bring you down.

[01:06] It's fucked up, but it's true. So the reverse of that would be somebody who

[01:10] roots for you in front of you and most specifically behind your back, Real Talk,

[01:15] that's one of the hardest things out there, especially amongst the guys, where it's very

[01:20] alpha competitive. As soon as your status starts to raise within the group, you buy comparison,

[01:26] make everyone else worse. So it's in their best interest to make you less of a threat to them

[01:32] by diminishing your status. The things like talking behind your back, trying to distract you,

[01:35] make you emotional, make you feel guilty about the things that you're doing,

[01:38] take you away, try and label you with old labels that are your old identity, not aligned with the

[01:42] things that you want to do later. And the thing is, is like, I don't think these are bad people

[01:46] to be clear. I don't even think there's good or bad people anyways. The question is just,

[01:49] are they going to help me towards my long term goal? Are they not? If it's more likely,

[01:54] they've earned a spot. They're paying their rents for my time and attention. If they're not

[01:58] more likely to help me hit my goal, then for me the question is, is there a relationship more important

[02:01] than my goal? And that's a decision for you. I made my goal my most important thing because I believe

[02:06] that if I achieve that goal, I would feel better about myself, my identity associated with it,

[02:11] and I think that there will be a new level of friends who would unlock as I got to that new level.

[02:15] And for me up to this point, that has been true. I'm not trying to achieve a common life goal.

[02:20] And so, it would make sense that my views would be more extreme than other people's.

[02:24] I also think that some of these views become compounded when you have increasing demands for your time.

[02:29] If that's not real for you right now, if you don't have people vying for every minute of your day right now,

[02:33] then what I'm saying might not be relevant for you, but for the people who do have people vying for every

[02:37] minute of their day, it might make more sense. There's a reason the bronze says no new friends.

[02:45] He used to started like he doesn't need any friends or he doesn't trust anyone new and that's fine.

[02:50] That works for him. He has a rare life. It would make sense that he has rare rules.

[02:54] You can't really give a fuck about what people say no more. Because everybody going fucking critique

[02:59] everything that you do no matter what you do. That's a equipment to your mind.

[03:02] The biggest issue that I've had with friendships in general is that people project with

[03:06] they believe friendships should look like in their minds onto our relationship. For me, I am transactional.

[03:14] This is a good probably pissed a lot of people off. The pros of this relationship should outweigh the

[03:18] cons. And if people were like, I can't believe you'd say that we probably wouldn't be friends. And that's okay.

[03:23] You'll probably friends with people who don't have that definition. But for me, that means that like my life is

[03:26] better off with you in it. You help me achieve my goal. You root for me along the way. If you think about

[03:32] everything you do as an investor, you invest time and energy into a relationship with the hopes of getting

[03:37] some sort of positive return. You spend that time no matter what. And the people who build the best

[03:43] relationships, the best networks, are the ones who invest in relationships that yield the highest returns.

[03:48] In terms of exchange, I believe in abundant exchange, which is if both of us feel like we're getting

[03:52] the better into the deal, then this relationship will continue adding in for a night. It's going to

[03:55] keep going. You would have no reason to end it where you get into trouble is the types of

[04:00] relationships that you're wondering should I keep these? You probably already know you shouldn't.

[04:04] And I love this little framework for decision making. When you're faced between a hard thing and the

[04:08] easy thing and you're not sure what to do, you should do the hard thing because if the easy thing

[04:12] were the right thing to do, you would have already done it. One of the hardest things about

[04:16] pursuing your dreams and pursuing your goals is that a lot of the people that are in your life right

[04:20] now will not support the future version of you that you need to become in order to accomplish those

[04:24] goals. People don't actually want the best for you. They want the version of you that best serves

[04:32] them. Now, the closer they are to you in terms of long-term alignment, the more likely those two

[04:37] versions of you will intersect, which is often why often not always why family and your spouse

[04:44] should hopefully be the most aligned with you because long-term their best interest is often aligned

[04:50] with your best interest. I think the spouse is like the enth degree of what the most extreme

[04:54] friendship looks like. That is the best friend you have for life, which means they should root for you

[04:58] harder than anyone else. They should never resent your success. The biggest, strongest ally you have.

[05:04] And then the friends you have are just non-sexualist versions of that core ally you have. There's a

[05:11] lot of statements that friends will make to try and keep you where you're at. They'll say, you've

[05:16] changed and they'll phrase it in a way that makes it feel like you're doing something wrong by changing.

[05:20] All you have to do is look back at them and say, you're right and you haven't. That carries almost

[05:25] an equal way back to them because some people want to stay the same. Kama and that's okay.

[05:29] That's been my recurring theme with friendships. It's just accepting them for what they are and saying,

[05:34] that's okay. Things have changed. Good. That's what growth is. You can't grow and stay the same.

[05:39] And if we want to grow as entrepreneurs, then we have to expect change. And the thing too

[05:43] pocket embodies this transition in between friends really well. And he said, just because you lost

[05:48] me as a friend doesn't mean you gained me as an enemy. I'm bigger than that. I still want to see

[05:52] you eat just not at my table. I don't wish you ill. I want you to succeed and I want you to do all

[05:57] the things you want to do in your life. It's just that your vision for your life doesn't

[06:00] merge with my vision for my life. It's the same thing as having an ex girlfriend or an ex boyfriend.

[06:05] You had a season together. It doesn't mean you don't honor the season and all of a sudden

[06:10] start destroying the memory. I appreciate the fact that you had a season. I understand that season

[06:14] is by their very nature end. We both contribute to another and then we found out that we want

[06:17] a different things which is great. That's the whole point of learning. The thing is there's a lot of

[06:21] people have these precepts of what a friend should be. We're going to be friends for life. How many

[06:26] 85 girls do you know who are friends with the same people in their life? Not many. And if they are,

[06:30] they've got like one. It's not common. But it is okay in my opinion to have seasons of friends.

[06:36] We're friends for the season and then we had train tracks that aligned and then we found out

[06:40] we had train tracks that diverted. Come on and that's okay. If you were had somebody who's like

[06:44] I was just trying to help and that person just like made your life ten times harder, that is not

[06:48] help. That is destruction. But true help comes from someone who comes into your life and all of a sudden

[06:52] everything gets easier. That is help. That is a friend. That is somebody who's an ally. Let me give you

[06:57] little frame shift around burning bridges because people love using that for it. You don't want

[07:00] to burn bridges. Remember where you came from. You can consider it burning a bridge but you could

[07:04] also consider it pruning a tree in order for the tree to grow. You only have certain amount of

[07:07] sunlight, water and minerals in the soil. The healthiest thing for the tree is to prune it. Cut the

[07:12] branch off. And that may seem uncarpened for many of you. But again, there's the hard thing and the

[07:17] easy thing. And if you're making the decision you already know the right thing is probably the hard one.

[07:20] So if you encounter somebody that's not aligned with the division of your life and it used to be

[07:26] your old life, they want to go to clubs every night. They want to drink on Sundays, do the bar

[07:29] crawls and now it's coming in conflict. They're losing a friend. So they want to keep you there.

[07:34] And that's okay. Like don't hate them for wanting that. It's just that it no longer aligns anymore.

[07:39] I think there's really two directions for these types of friendships. Number one is that if you decrease

[07:43] the frequency of communication with someone, over time you get fewer and fewer invites and then it

[07:47] kind of fizzles. That's how most friendships or loose acquaintances end. The very hands select

[07:53] a few of times where you have family or like super close homies, whatever you want to call it. I

[07:59] have one framework for having really hard conversations. But I stole from Layla. Keep the other person

[08:03] as a human being at the forefront of the conversation rather than being right. If I remind myself

[08:08] every time I go into hard conversations that way, it's amazing how much better of a conversation I have.

[08:13] And accepting responsibility for the fact that like, hey, I've changed and that's not on you.

[08:18] That's on me. If it means that we're not hanging out as much anymore, again, it doesn't mean that

[08:22] you have me as an enemy. Come on. And that's okay. I think that you can have friends who aren't necessarily

[08:27] pursuing greatness as long as they're helping you pursue yours. That's the bridge in my opinion.

[08:32] I like to be inspired by the people that I'm around. I want to admire something in every friend

[08:38] that I have. I have a very close friend of mine who is an FBI agent. Every time I talk to him,

[08:45] he's got like new stories of things that he's doing. And for me, the benefit I get from the relationship

[08:50] is that it gives me a scape from the day-to-day business stuff that I'm dealing with. He benefits

[08:55] in no way from the status from the followers because he is knowing to financially benefit. He's an FBI agent.

[09:01] But what we both mutually appreciate about one another is that we both been committed to being

[09:05] excellent at our craft. I just want people who are as passionate about their art as I am,

[09:10] who root for me to make the best painting possible. That's what I'm really going for. At the end of

[09:14] day, it's just like, does this person make me better if they don't? Then why are you here?

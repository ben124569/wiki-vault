[00:00] Every time I take a step towards kind of a better ideal in this direction,

[00:03] I make significantly more money. It's how I figure it out, chair it with you. But recently I've been spending a lot of time reading.

[00:09] It's specifically reading from people who make a lot more money than I do. And I think that I haven't had a good

[00:16] kind of a little bit more head-eave a podcast until recently, so I'm going to try and break that street today.

[00:21] So one of the hardest learn lessons that I've been in, I'm still actively learning it,

[00:26] but every time I take a step towards kind of a better ideal in this direction,

[00:30] I make significantly more money. It's how I figure it out, chair it with you.

[00:34] So, in some of my earlier podcasts, I talk a lot about focus, right, about learning to say no.

[00:40] And I think that over the last year and a half, two years,

[00:44] there had been my hardest learned lessons where I said yes to opportunities that were now at a larger size

[00:50] than what I used to learn to say no, too. And so I've referenced the opportunities that

[00:55] come to us as the woman in the red dress, if you're familiar with the matrix, is that.

[01:00] The thing is that at every opportunity level, as you level up, the opportunities become sex

[01:04] here, right, the woman in the red dress becomes more attractive. Because, you know, in the very

[01:09] beginning before you've made any money, anything is attractive. You say yes to anything.

[01:14] But then as you acquire more and more, more skills, more and more opportunities open up and better

[01:17] and better opportunities open up, which is why you have to like relearn the same

[01:22] concept, but at a different level, right? Because at one point, you don't say, you say yes to a

[01:29] 10 million dollar opportunity or a one million dollar opportunity, everything's relative, right?

[01:33] But at another level, you have to learn to say no to that if you were above that, at that certain

[01:38] time. And I think I've made that mistake multiple times at different levels. And so, I'm partially

[01:43] making this, you know, video for me. And so, there's a book called The Roadless Stupid.

[01:49] It's really, really good. I'd highly recommend it, especially if you're an entrepreneur.

[01:54] And especially if you're prone to getting excited about new ideas, constantly wanting to end

[01:58] of a constantly wanting to tweak and change things, which is really, really, you know, the thing

[02:02] that excites us a lot. And it's a lot of times it's the key to, to big breakthroughs. That being said,

[02:08] one of the quotes I used to quote a lot was from Jeff Basos who said, basically business is different

[02:14] from baseball in that in business, in baseball when you swing for the fences, the most you can ever

[02:19] score is four runs, right? But in business, everyone's in a while when you step up with the plate,

[02:23] if you hit the ball hard enough, you can score a thousand runs. And so, big people who bet big,

[02:29] win big, but they bear the cost of experimentation, right? And so, he references earlier on in that

[02:36] in that little address that he said, if you have a chance of a hundred times pay off, and you've

[02:42] got a one at a chance of hitting it, you should take that bet every time. And after having

[02:46] thought about this, I mean, Jeff, obviously makes a lot more money than I do. I think that that's not,

[02:51] it's correct mathematically, but in practicality, I think there's another sentence that needs to be

[02:57] added to it. And so, to give it a realistic context, imagine you're going to the casino, and that's

[03:02] the bet, right? That's the bet is you have to put, let's say, $10 down and you can win a thousand, but you've

[03:10] got to one at a ten chance, right? Now, here's where it makes it realistic. Let's say you only go into the

[03:16] casino with $30, then what do you do? Think about it. So that means that if you were to bet three times,

[03:23] you've got a one, you've only got a one at a three chance of ever coming out of the casino with anything,

[03:28] right? And so, that's, I think, a more realistic paradigm for what most entrepreneurs go into,

[03:34] because you have a constrained amount of capital money and a constrained amount of time and resources

[03:39] and bandwidth for your team. And so, kind of adapting that extra sentence on there, of just

[03:43] understanding that there's a cost to making that bet. It's not just, oh, if I have a one at a

[03:48] 10 chance of scoring a thousand, then I should definitely make that bet every time for a $10 bet.

[03:55] Yes, you absolutely should mathematically. And in Jeff's case, he's had access to unlimited money,

[04:01] virtually unlimited money for 20 years. He's been able to read race funding and fun. I mean,

[04:06] they have $500 million messups and they're like, whoops, that didn't work. But a lot of us don't

[04:11] have that. And so, there's, in the, in the, the book The Road Less stupid, he gives a context that I think

[04:18] is really, really been useful for me, even lately, in making decisions about opportunities, right?

[04:24] It's the things that I have to say no to. And so, the three questions are really simple, which is why I've

[04:29] been using them so much, which is, what's my upside? What's my downside? And can I live

[04:35] assuming that the downside's going to happen? And so, the third question stated a little bit

[04:40] differently, but that's how I'm using it. And in phrasing the three questions that way, it's helped

[04:45] me so much in saying no, right? And like, man, why don't we try this new follow-up sequence so that we can

[04:53] get, you know, more leads in? Well, what's the, what's my upside? Maybe I got a 10% boost. What's my

[04:59] downside? I lose 50% because the test doesn't work or at bombs, because what I'm going against

[05:04] is a control, which has already been tested against other things and is working. And can I live with

[05:10] my downside of losing 50% for the hopes of gaining 10? No, I can't, because I'm going to assume

[05:16] them and it make that loss, it's that I just say no. And what's happening is it's giving me so

[05:20] much attention back so that when I'm making my bets, because ultimately, if you really think

[05:24] about what businesses at it's very basic, it's just betting, which is why a lot of entrepreneurs love

[05:30] gambling. Because it's what we do. We do in a controlled setting, it's like, you know, businesses

[05:34] the ultimate version of poker, right? Like poker is a combination of skill and luck, right? Business,

[05:40] I would say is even more skill and still a little bit of luck. And so it just has more skill in

[05:44] our control, but the other day there's still bets that we're placing. It's not just un-black and red.

[05:49] It's should I hire a salesperson first or should I spend more in this marketing campaign? Should I

[05:55] test out this new follow-up sequence or should we try and run SEO or should we do cold outbound

[06:02] messenger, right? And so it's like all of these things are decisions we're choosing between

[06:06] two different opportunities. And I think if you apply that framework, that three question framework,

[06:11] it's been, I just like, for me it's been a game changer, it's been so helpful. And we've seen,

[06:16] you know, huge, we've reaped the benefit in the business just in the last 90 days, even during

[06:22] COVID we've had some explosive growth. I'll tell you more about it in a couple of months.

[06:27] But it's been in really trying to hone that discipline and I feel like at every level,

[06:31] you get that discipline muscle gets stronger and stronger and stronger and the things that are

[06:35] able to see notes you get better and better and better. And so one of the things that if you look

[06:39] at, if you study like Charlie Moodler and Mother, we talk about the best, the best betters, the best

[06:44] gamblers actually bet the least frequently. They actually bet the fewest amount of times, but when

[06:51] they bet, they bet big. And so I'm trying to really apply that and when they bet big, they bet on what

[06:58] they call no brainers. It shouldn't be like you should have in their mind,

[07:04] virtually no chance of not succeeding when you make the bet. And then if you think about that,

[07:09] then your life will shoot. I mean, one will ever see those types of bets. If you look at them

[07:14] over 40 years, they only have 15 bets that have created all of the billions that they've been

[07:18] able to generate. 15, 15 winning bets out of all the bets they've made, and the winning bets that

[07:22] got them where they are. And I think that in business it's a lot like that. So let me just tell you

[07:27] one quick anecdote to wrap this up. To make this real for you, tell me if this sounds realistic.

[07:34] You get really excited about a new concept, a new idea that you think you're going to test out.

[07:40] And you pitch it to the team, let them know what's going to happen. You're saying we're starting on

[07:46] money. This can be the new way we do things. The team's not 100%. Trained up on it, but they're kind of

[07:52] flies you go. Your teammates can't even rock and roll with this thing. And after a month or two

[08:00] months you look back at your stats, they're pretty much the same. Maybe you've been a little bit less.

[08:05] There's like three other things that happened during that same period of time. I don't know if

[08:08] it was this or it was because of the new process. Honestly, this and that, and then all of a sudden

[08:14] you realize that you didn't even get a definitive answer on the test that you ran. And you definitely

[08:19] didn't get the result that you were hoping for. And so what ends up happening is that you're

[08:23] company and you incurred this enormous cost of change without real, like without any real upside.

[08:30] And so in thinking through the bets that I'm making now, I'm assuming the cost and what I mean,

[08:37] like I'm assuming that I'm going to have the downside. Even the one that I'm understanding,

[08:41] but I'm assuming there's going to be some that are unknown that I'm going to have to incur.

[08:44] And so when I'm making that assumption, which is that third question, which is, and can I live with

[08:49] it assuming that it does happen? It's been so illuminating for me and so helpful for me because

[08:55] what happens is you get in these vicious cycles, especially if you're in an emotional situation

[09:02] because I know a lot of, we're a lot of business owners in general right now are cash constrained,

[09:07] they're trying to figure out what to do, they're trying to pivot fast, make fast decisions on

[09:10] incomplete information, sometimes I'm such just the name of the game, right? But in doing that,

[09:17] they're hoping for the Hail Mary. And so their internal optimism, which is what leads them to be an

[09:23] entrepreneur, ends up weighing against them, it ends up stacking the chips against them because that

[09:30] one thing which is being your hope, right? Your gray strength can become your gray sweetness

[09:36] is an entrepreneur, there's no different, right? Our optimism can become our Achilles heel because

[09:40] we believe that the chance of success is actually greater than it really is and we underestimate

[09:46] the cost of taking the bet and that's where we get fucked, right? And so when you go back to the casino

[09:53] and when you're considering the bets and you're like, man, if this hits, this could be 10 times

[09:58] what we're doing right now, right? But just remember you only might have three bets to make and you

[10:03] got to one at a 10 shot. So, use them wisely. So anyways, I hope that was useful for you, it's been

[10:09] incredibly useful for me. I've been saying no to way more tests and tweaks and variations and just

[10:17] small things that would really distract the team and just saying guys, we're just going to keep

[10:22] we're going to keep focusing on executing, we're going to keep focusing on doing better at the

[10:26] fundamentals and it continues to pay dividends because the team doesn't have to be scattered, they just

[10:31] have to think how can we get 1% better every day, rather than 1% better for two weeks and then

[10:36] change everything and then 1% better for two weeks and then change everything, right?

[10:39] Well, they never actually get to get that long term compounding improvement, which is what ultimately

[10:45] will separate you over time. So, like I said, up those values before you, it's been it's been a

[10:49] huge lesson for me and in studying some of the the greats, the all-time greats, seeing how they

[10:54] make decisions, seeing where they place their bets, I wish I had learned it earlier, but hopefully I can

[11:02] pass at least that, then I'll get on to you because it's been really helpful for me. So, lots

[11:05] of love keeping awesome up here for me Saturday and hopefully a beautiful view here from bear lake

[11:14] and I'll catch you guys soon.

[00:00] Here's how to actually scale an education business.

[00:02] You feel like you're losing customers,

[00:03] you're not sure how to expand.

[00:05] And so education businesses, one,

[00:06] are they sellable to are they viable?

[00:08] And then three, where do they go wrong?

[00:10] I'm gonna cover it all right now.

[00:11] How to make a move?

[00:13] Back, streets, back.

[00:15] All right.

[00:15] Where's it, let's go?

[00:16] I don't know.

[00:17] I actually don't know the words of the song.

[00:18] Don't know the words to any song, believe it or not.

[00:20] Except for one that I did for poetry class in seventh grade.

[00:23] Anyways, that's not why you're here.

[00:25] Here's the issue.

[00:25] Many people have education businesses.

[00:28] Books, courses, coaching, all that stuff.

[00:30] And they want to make sellable businesses.

[00:33] They also want their customers to never leave.

[00:35] And so they have these problems,

[00:37] which is that customers are leaving,

[00:38] and their business isn't sellable.

[00:39] And they think there's something wrong with their business.

[00:42] And the answer is maybe.

[00:44] So let's dive into this.

[00:45] Number one, what makes Harvard Harvard?

[00:48] Well, number one is that Harvard has standards.

[00:50] So they have many people apply and only if you get in.

[00:52] If you accept everybody who has a credit card,

[00:54] that's not a very high standard.

[00:55] And so if you want to create a brand around education,

[00:56] you can't let everybody in.

[00:58] Thing number one.

[00:59] Thing number two, Harvard makes no promises.

[01:02] They don't say, hey, you're going to make this much money.

[01:04] And you're going to make it this many days.

[01:05] They've completely gone away from that.

[01:07] Instead, it's just it costs as much money to get in.

[01:10] And you might not get a result.

[01:13] Now, here's the craziest part.

[01:14] Number three, not everyone passes.

[01:17] Not only does not everyone get in,

[01:18] and everyone pays with no promise, not everyone passes.

[01:21] And see, if you just look at those three criteria,

[01:23] there's more.

[01:24] But if you just look at those three criteria,

[01:25] you be like, oh, that's why

[01:26] they're different from 99% of other education businesses.

[01:29] In general, they also do education.

[01:31] Now, what else is different about their thing?

[01:33] Well, it's in person versus remote,

[01:35] which is probably again, another big differentiation

[01:38] for the vast majority of these businesses.

[01:39] On top of that, the network of the quality of the people

[01:41] is probably the most valuable thing that they give

[01:43] on top of the brand.

[01:44] They just curate and experience for very smart people.

[01:47] And they slap their brand on top of them.

[01:48] And fundamentally, that's actually what they sell.

[01:51] What's the next issue that comes up for most people

[01:53] of like, why is my business not a Harvard?

[01:55] They will then get into, well, my customers leave.

[01:58] So do Harvard's.

[02:00] They leave after four years.

[02:01] Now, they also have an extended time rise

[02:03] in terms of the promise of when someone might get to the end

[02:06] of this thing.

[02:07] Yours is six weeks.

[02:07] There's might be six years.

[02:08] What is continuity in the form of education?

[02:11] Well, every quarter you have new courses

[02:14] and you have a curricula.

[02:15] And so a lot of people who are in the education space

[02:18] are like, I want to teach this one thing

[02:20] and I want to be able to pay me for it forever.

[02:21] And the reason for that is because people in the education space

[02:24] mistake a payment plan for continuity.

[02:27] So if you have sell something that cost $12,000

[02:30] and you give them access to it for a year

[02:32] and people paying $1,000 a month,

[02:34] you don't have churn people have graduated.

[02:37] You have a payment plan, not continuity.

[02:39] If you're trying to solve for continuity

[02:40] or solve for cell ability, let's go into those.

[02:44] Why not?

[02:44] We're partying, right?

[02:45] A business that has enterprise value

[02:47] has reliability of future cash flow.

[02:49] Meaning, there's a highlight near that this business

[02:50] will continue to make one in the future.

[02:52] And so typically, like a Harvard has a brand

[02:54] and so because of that brand, they're not worried about demand.

[02:56] They can demonstrate the fact that they have a certain number

[02:58] of a reable or a plug or a year

[03:00] and a certain number of slots available.

[03:01] And so because of that supply to manage companies,

[03:03] because of the brand that they built,

[03:04] they are able to likely, if it were a private enterprise,

[03:07] what is private, but it's not a nonprofit.

[03:09] It's not a for-profit institution, it's a nonprofit.

[03:11] Technically, let's not get into that.

[03:12] Point is, is that for your business to have value,

[03:15] you're going to have to build a brand around it

[03:16] that guarantees demand in the future.

[03:18] Because, and this is the big one, because education

[03:21] does not lead to continuity,

[03:23] except under one circumstance.

[03:24] So let me explain.

[03:25] So if you see someone to do a thing,

[03:27] they usually learn the thing if you're good.

[03:28] And then they graduate from the thing.

[03:29] And they should do that.

[03:30] But a lot of people are like, man,

[03:32] I want a Harvard-curing revenue.

[03:33] But the thing is is that you have to break up

[03:35] the deliverable that you have into two different columns.

[03:38] All right, so this is a good exercise for you to think for it.

[03:40] Column A is what's the stuff that someone uses one time

[03:44] gets the value and then after they get the value,

[03:46] it's no longer valuable.

[03:47] So if I teach you how to sell and then you know how to sell,

[03:49] I don't need to teach you again, you already have the value.

[03:51] If I teach you how to generate leads for yourself,

[03:53] as soon as you learn the skill, the skill,

[03:55] now continues to provide value,

[03:57] but I no longer provide value to you in teaching it, right?

[03:59] So there are education components which are typically one time value.

[04:03] People aren't on a, like, for a Harvard, for example,

[04:05] they teach you, you know, communication 101.

[04:07] Okay, after that semester,

[04:09] you don't take communication 101 again.

[04:10] And it would be weird that they tried to charge you again

[04:12] for communication 101, because they're like,

[04:13] why are they, I know it.

[04:14] But we do this and as a weaset,

[04:17] entrepreneurs who do education stuff,

[04:19] trying to do this stuff all the time.

[04:21] Now you're like, wait a second,

[04:22] then how did Jim launch sell for a lot of money?

[04:25] If there was enterprise value,

[04:26] ah, because most people mistakenly think Jim launch

[04:28] was an education business.

[04:30] And that's because the people who profit

[04:31] from education businesses try to sell you on that.

[04:34] As the owner of Jim launch, I could tell you,

[04:36] the vast majority of the enterprise value

[04:37] and that business was not from education.

[04:41] Because there's other things.

[04:42] So I said, column A is one time value.

[04:44] Column B is consumables.

[04:46] Things that continue to provide value again and again.

[04:48] And again, if you look at your service,

[04:50] which I like to think of it from that perspective,

[04:52] what are the other things that you have in the business

[04:54] that someone must use again and again and again?

[04:57] Examples.

[04:59] For Jim launch, one of the primary things that we do there

[05:01] is that we go and test ads in represented markets.

[05:04] We spend our own money to get ads that we know work.

[05:07] And then once we have that ad,

[05:08] we then sell it at a margin basically to everyone else.

[05:12] And it's 100% gross margins for us

[05:13] after we've incurred the initial cost of one,

[05:16] filming the ads, you know, editing the ads

[05:18] and then displaying the ads actually running them,

[05:20] putting the money behind it to see which ones are the winners.

[05:22] But once we scoop up the four or five winners,

[05:24] we can just hand them to a thousand or 10,000 locations.

[05:27] And they are valuable to each of those locations

[05:30] because within those local markets, they are new ads.

[05:31] But what do you need next month, more new ads?

[05:34] And so does it consumable?

[05:36] That has 100% gross margins that can be sold again and again.

[05:40] And again, what else do you think someone could have

[05:42] that is consumable?

[05:43] There's a great school community, for example,

[05:45] where they do 3D printing.

[05:46] So the guy teaches 3D printing, how do you do it?

[05:48] How do you set it up, whatever?

[05:49] One time value.

[05:50] And then after that, every month,

[05:52] he scours the internet for new products

[05:54] that are hot and trending right now

[05:56] so that you could set up with your 3D printing business.

[05:59] And so people stay every month

[06:01] because they can get this list, the hot list

[06:02] and then they grab the things off that list

[06:04] and they stay in there.

[06:05] And for him, he just has to do the one time work

[06:07] of curating the list and then he can sell it

[06:09] over and over again.

[06:10] But people stay because they don't want to lose it.

[06:12] I'll give you different business.

[06:12] There's a real state business.

[06:13] And they have super low-churning.

[06:15] One of the reason they've low-churning

[06:16] is because every month he has burd dogs,

[06:18] so basically when people go out and scout for properties

[06:21] and he puts a list out of properties

[06:22] that meet his criteria for his way of doing wholesale.

[06:25] And so then people pay to be in his community

[06:27] in order to have access to this list of fresh properties.

[06:31] So he does the one time work

[06:32] and then he basically likes to set a fractionalized

[06:34] to sale of that to many people.

[06:35] Now, these are the consumable consumables.

[06:38] What other ones are common?

[06:39] Let's think through it.

[06:40] So one of them is you've got community.

[06:42] Community and in it of itself

[06:44] is actually a consumer thing.

[06:45] You used it this month, you used it next month, right?

[06:47] These are things you can do.

[06:47] These are fundamentally what network effects exist.

[06:49] If you can build a valuable enough network,

[06:51] people don't want to leave that network.

[06:52] And fundamentally it can use ours on a micro level.

[06:54] Now, what are other things that you might use?

[06:56] Use traditional services.

[06:57] So if you have a marketing agency, you might pay monthly.

[07:00] If you do SEO, you might pay monthly.

[07:01] And so we have to look at our deliverables

[07:03] and think what are the things that are one time

[07:05] and what are the things that are consumer?

[07:06] And then here's the key part.

[07:08] We have to price them appropriately.

[07:09] The reality is that education extremely valuable,

[07:12] there's a reason that Harvard can spend

[07:13] charge $60,000 a year or 70 or whatever it is now,

[07:16] is because that is very valuable to educate someone,

[07:19] gives them they basically pay today to increase their skills

[07:22] so they can increase their future earnings.

[07:24] That's what education is about.

[07:25] It's literally increasing someone's future earnings.

[07:26] That's why people learn shit.

[07:27] Or if they want to learn how to pay,

[07:29] then they could obviously monetize that.

[07:31] Two of us have people who just want to learn how to pay.

[07:32] They want to hire a new music.

[07:33] They want to learn how to sing.

[07:35] Whatever the skill is, right?

[07:36] But they pay today because they know

[07:38] that they're basically paying a discount

[07:39] over the long haul as long as they learn the skill.

[07:41] So in this context, how do we get customers sick?

[07:45] One is, with the pricing, we want to price the one-time value

[07:48] as high as we possibly can,

[07:50] relative to what people are willing to pay.

[07:51] On the consumable part, we price it

[07:53] where people are also willing to pay

[07:55] if the other piece didn't exist.

[07:57] So think about this.

[07:57] This is the big mistake, right?

[07:58] This is the big mistake.

[07:59] Is that people will price their consumable

[08:02] at a payment plan price of their one-time upfront value.

[08:06] For example, if something sort of $30,000,

[08:08] then they say, cool, you can pay $2500 a month

[08:11] for 12 months and you're going to get this one-time value

[08:14] and this consumer will value.

[08:15] But then, once people have kind of drained that one-time value

[08:17] and sometimes it takes less time than a year,

[08:19] then people exit because the consumer value is not worth

[08:23] the $2500.

[08:24] This is why I'm a big fan of the,

[08:25] or a big advocate of the big head-long tail model,

[08:27] which is maybe the upfront thing is worth really $10,000.

[08:31] And your consumer thing might be worth 100.

[08:33] It might be worth 200.

[08:34] It might worth 500.

[08:35] I don't know what that is.

[08:36] But if you only sold that,

[08:38] so the super good amount of frame is,

[08:39] if you only sold this thing,

[08:41] what do you think would be a price that people would not want to leave?

[08:43] That's the price you have for your continuity,

[08:45] because that is the price that people really need to stay at.

[08:47] And typically, it's a significantly lower

[08:49] than a spread out version of the upfront value

[08:52] of whatever the educational skill is.

[08:54] It's you have to differentiate this things.

[08:55] Now, beyond that, you might be like, well, shoot.

[08:58] My consumer goals aren't worth that much.

[09:00] Fine.

[09:01] Then, structure your pricing so that you always have a value

[09:03] to Scarf's in what you charge them

[09:05] in what they, what you deliver.

[09:06] Now, the other piece of this is, okay, well,

[09:09] I wanna have enterprise value in the business,

[09:10] which means that I should have a reliability

[09:12] if you're revenue.

[09:13] Sure, we have a little bit of our consumables.

[09:15] That will stack up over time, great.

[09:16] If we have our upfront, which typically serves

[09:18] to liquidate the acquisition cost,

[09:19] at least how I like to structure things,

[09:21] for the high, high margin continuity

[09:23] that goes on the back end.

[09:24] But what else can we do?

[09:26] Well, what does Harvard do?

[09:26] They sell you more courses.

[09:28] They sell you more degrees.

[09:29] You wanna have a pass, or I guess what you have now?

[09:31] You wanna get a master's get a master's,

[09:33] you have to have a master's, what do you get?

[09:34] You got a PhD?

[09:35] Well, after a PhD, you get a double PhD.

[09:37] You got a super duper PhD, right?

[09:39] They'll keep selling you, but the thing is,

[09:40] that's the continuity, that's the latter.

[09:42] It's just what's the higher level version,

[09:44] but they also know that it's a fraction of that, right?

[09:48] If 100 kids go to get a bachelor's,

[09:51] it might only be 10%, or 20% out of the numbers.

[09:54] 20% that they get a master's,

[09:55] and if the master's, maybe it's only 10% of them,

[09:57] they get a PhD.

[09:58] Also, the pricing also reflects that.

[10:00] Interesting, right?

[10:02] Now, back to the stickiness of the business.

[10:05] A piece of advice, don't start an education business.

[10:09] And then say, I'm going to make it a SaaS company.

[10:12] Famous last words.

[10:14] Now, if you're white labeling somebody's tool, whatever,

[10:17] it's not really yours and fine.

[10:19] That's really just you being an affiliate

[10:20] if someone else is there, whatever.

[10:21] But if you're like, I'm gonna start something from scratch.

[10:23] The likely that you succeed is basically zero.

[10:26] And when I say succeed is like,

[10:28] actually have a true software exit.

[10:30] I have yet to see, literally, yet to see.

[10:33] And I would do a lot of businesses,

[10:34] and I kind of sit in the space,

[10:36] like I understand it pretty well.

[10:37] I have yet to see a business that is successful

[10:39] and the likely that you're the special stuff like,

[10:42] is probably not a bet that I'd be willing to make.

[10:43] You might feel like a special stuff like,

[10:45] your mom might have told you your special stuff like,

[10:47] your father, well, you hopefully didn't tell your special stuff

[10:49] like, you should hopefully have you proved it.

[10:51] But the point is, it's unlikely.

[10:53] And I prefer to make bets that where if I wait, I win.

[10:58] And if I look around and look at the marketplace

[11:00] and no one's won using this path,

[11:02] it's probably because it's a flawed path.

[11:03] And it is, because when you track some of the education

[11:05] that you try to keep them with software,

[11:08] it typically doesn't work unless it's a core function

[11:12] of the business.

[11:12] And you're fully focused on it, which you probably are.

[11:14] So, if you want something that is super soluble,

[11:19] then you want something that's sticky.

[11:21] If you want something that's sticky,

[11:22] then make the business about the sticky thing.

[11:24] Bought a stickiness here, right?

[11:25] Now, the trade that most people in education

[11:27] and even media companies make

[11:28] is that instead of having something that is inherently viable

[11:31] as an asset, they tend to just make more money

[11:33] than the otherwise wood with a similar scale, business,

[11:36] and just about any other space.

[11:38] And I see that is the trade of future value,

[11:40] or future money for today's dollars.

[11:42] I'll give you a story.

[11:43] So, a money mine had a business

[11:44] he worked on it for between eight to 12 years,

[11:47] okay remember.

[11:48] And he took a salary of $70,000 a year.

[11:50] And at the end of that period of time,

[11:51] he sold the business software company

[11:52] for $250 million.

[11:53] So, $30,000 a year for eight years, 10 years, 12 years.

[11:57] He lived on Dave Ramsey's style,

[11:59] paid his ass off, like, lived on that,

[12:01] and then boom, $250 million.

[12:02] He could have done an education business

[12:05] and maybe made $10 million a year

[12:07] for that whole time.

[12:08] He's skilled enough for a fast-burning.

[12:09] And so, the question is,

[12:11] how do you want to make money?

[12:12] And I want to be clear,

[12:13] I don't think there's anything wrong with saying,

[12:15] I have a business that makes you $10 million

[12:16] a year that I'll never be able to sell.

[12:17] Well, you get to enjoy the $10 million

[12:19] every single year.

[12:20] So, I mean, life's only going to one direction.

[12:22] It's getting shorter.

[12:23] So, I mean, I don't think there's anything

[12:26] inherently wrong with that.

[12:26] There's this kind of mantra of what I call

[12:29] the three Marshmallow problem.

[12:30] So, there's the typical story of the child

[12:33] who gets put into a room and gets one marshmallow now,

[12:36] and if he doesn't eat the marshmallow,

[12:37] he gets two marshmallows.

[12:38] The problem with that for those of you

[12:41] who learned how to delay the gratification

[12:44] is that once you learn that skill,

[12:45] you then want to delay gratification forever.

[12:47] And then you hope for this third marshmallow

[12:49] that might never come.

[12:49] Think about different versions of this experiment.

[12:51] If we were to say,

[12:52] hey, you get one marshmallow now,

[12:54] and if you wait a year,

[12:55] you can get a second marshmallow.

[12:57] Is it worth waiting a year for a second marshmallow?

[13:00] Like, is the payoff of a second marshmallow worth it?

[13:02] Maybe?

[13:03] Maybe not.

[13:04] Is it worth it?

[13:05] Is it worth it at the end of your life?

[13:06] You get the second marshmallow?

[13:08] Maybe?

[13:08] Maybe not.

[13:09] And so, I think a lot of people

[13:10] mistake delaying gratification

[13:13] with maximizing gratification.

[13:15] Yes, it's true.

[13:16] Delaying gratification in general

[13:17] tends to, especially at the beginning,

[13:19] increase your reward.

[13:20] But at some point there is a diminishing return

[13:22] in my opinion, beyond which you should just

[13:25] get your reward, right?

[13:26] Also, there's this misconception, I think,

[13:29] that by taking the reward,

[13:31] unlike the experiment that it prevents you

[13:33] or precludes you from getting another marshmallow

[13:35] again later, which oftentimes it doesn't.

[13:37] And so I think there's a sweet spot,

[13:39] and that's like most things,

[13:40] is that the magic is in the middle,

[13:42] is being able to balance both extremes.

[13:44] And what many people will do,

[13:46] strivers, especially, will just suffer

[13:49] for extended periods of time,

[13:51] and then sometimes they may even get

[13:52] the second marshmallow in the first marshmallow state.

[13:54] I don't see an issue with the fact that the business

[13:56] that you have might just generate more cash flow

[13:58] and not really be that sellable.

[14:00] That's okay, it's a trade you make.

[14:01] And I think that's a reasonable trade.

[14:03] But if you want to get have your cake and eat it too,

[14:06] then there is one specific type of education

[14:08] that does have continuity.

[14:10] And so that's what I'll dive into.

[14:11] So obviously all the components that I talked about

[14:13] that are consumables, those will drive continuity.

[14:15] But there is one specific type of education

[14:17] that drives continuity, which is continued education.

[14:20] So there are professions where you have to stay up to date

[14:23] with technology, you have to stay up to date

[14:25] with new practices.

[14:26] Where if you can build a business where you

[14:27] re-certify people on new skills or new technologies

[14:30] that come out on a consistent basis,

[14:32] then that membership, which is really what the business is.

[14:35] That membership business can over time continue compound

[14:38] and you can demonstrate that people

[14:39] stay with you for an entire career.

[14:41] If you can demonstrate that, then you have a business

[14:43] that is very valuable and is an education

[14:46] and can sell at almost a tech multiple.

[14:48] And fundamentally and inherently,

[14:50] technology businesses aren't,

[14:52] they don't get these multiples because it's not like,

[14:54] oh, I have a software there for,

[14:55] I get a software exit.

[14:57] Like no one gets this.

[14:58] And the thing is that people will preach this

[15:00] because they want to sell you on that idea.

[15:02] But that's not how an investor sees it.

[15:04] The things that make a software valuable

[15:05] are the things that make a business valuable,

[15:07] which is that there is revenue retention.

[15:09] There's high gross margin.

[15:10] There's high incremental margin.

[15:11] There's less operational drag at scale.

[15:14] These are all the things that make software companies

[15:16] at scale more valuable.

[15:18] It's not the fact that they use code that makes them valuable.

[15:21] If you sell people into a software

[15:22] and they turn out every six months,

[15:25] that's not valuable.

[15:26] It's basically the same as the service.

[15:27] And you're gonna be valued based on the fact

[15:29] that you have customers that come in every,

[15:31] get up, keep it out all the time.

[15:32] And the thing that you'd have to establish

[15:34] is a brand that would improve out the fact

[15:35] that you're gonna continue to have to man like Harvard

[15:37] for years to come.

[15:38] And so if you're not doing this,

[15:39] then you're basically just building

[15:40] something that generates cash flow,

[15:41] which to be fair.

[15:42] I'm not saying this in the wrong with that.

[15:44] But the big misconception is the idea

[15:46] that number one, there's something wrong with it.

[15:48] Number two, that I have to add software,

[15:50] something to make my company valuable.

[15:51] Which it won't make it valuable.

[15:52] It'll likely make it a distraction

[15:54] and decrease the size of the business.

[15:56] Number three, we're cranking.

[15:58] You're charging too much for the consumption

[16:01] and too little for the education.

[16:02] You probably need to do this.

[16:04] Charge more for the upper thing

[16:05] because it is life transferring value.

[16:07] And then charge less for the thing that's ongoing

[16:09] because it probably is less viable than the other one.

[16:11] And if you're like, I'm not sure if mine is less valuable,

[16:13] which is looking your turn.

[16:14] People are telling you if it's less valuable.

[16:15] And if you don't have something that is consumption based,

[16:17] think about what components of whatever it is that you sell,

[16:20] someone must consume one of them

[16:22] of the basic they use and reuse

[16:24] so that you can get them to buy again and again.

[16:26] So these are my qualms with education done, right?

[16:29] This is how I think about it.

[16:30] And hopefully that should put to rest one,

[16:33] how do I sell my education business?

[16:35] Well, it's not about education business

[16:36] about keeping a business that keeps customers

[16:38] for a long time and having high-grace margins.

[16:40] I give you one model that does work.

[16:42] The other model is having a stack of consumables,

[16:44] continued education is also a method that works there.

[16:46] But again, that's the new thing, that's the PhD,

[16:48] that's the masters.

[16:49] It's certification level 123456, right?

[16:52] It's the extra thing that you're doing

[16:53] and you have to understand that there's going to be

[16:54] a trade-off or drop-off at each level.

[16:56] Now, if you sell only continued education

[16:59] on the front end, then you have people

[17:00] already have preposites on the issue there.

[17:02] It's going to be finding the people already

[17:03] have the preposite that matches your continued education

[17:05] demands, all businesses and problems.

[17:08] Now, if I wanted to go use my marketing skills on something

[17:11] because you probably, if you sell education,

[17:12] you have to get good marketing sales.

[17:13] It's one of the parts of the business.

[17:14] If you want to build something like that,

[17:16] then let me give you the easiest hack in the world

[17:18] to build something that's really viable.

[17:19] Find stuff, people already, don't stop buying.

[17:23] Then use your marketing and sales skills on that,

[17:25] which is one of the other we did with private equity.

[17:27] So what I put in my feature set to make it stickier.

[17:29] So number one is I would add a few things as possible

[17:33] and you likely can delete things.

[17:34] This is big.

[17:35] This is very big.

[17:36] How many education businesses do you know

[17:37] that include calls, accountability,

[17:41] some sort of resource library, library of all past,

[17:44] Q&A calls or one of what calls?

[17:46] Probably a lot of them.

[17:47] Have any of them self-churn?

[17:50] No.

[17:51] If you want to have a feature set,

[17:53] the way that I think about feature sets

[17:55] is that I want each feature to be on its own

[17:58] valuable enough to more than justify three or four times

[18:02] the price.

[18:02] If someone can't just say it's worth it for this alone,

[18:05] then I don't want it in the stack.

[18:06] And that may mean you only have three or four things.

[18:08] Or two things, or one thing.

[18:09] And you just do it really well.

[18:10] That's fine.

[18:11] So that's in terms of how I'm thinking through it.

[18:12] In terms of what things should I add and when,

[18:15] we have to answer what problem we're solving.

[18:17] If people are churning and you have an education business,

[18:19] well, unless you're doing continued education,

[18:21] that is the nature of the business

[18:22] and you're probably misprice in the back

[18:23] and probably misprice in the front end.

[18:24] In terms of when to add it,

[18:25] it would be when I know that this particular service

[18:29] is something that people consume again and again and again.

[18:32] So if you get repeated questions,

[18:33] month after month of a problem that they need to get solved,

[18:36] this is where service businesses start to sprout off

[18:39] of education.

[18:40] Now what you'll realize is if you do the service well,

[18:42] the service business itself will be more valuable

[18:44] than the education business

[18:45] because they're not coming for the education

[18:47] to come for the service,

[18:47] they come for the service,

[18:48] they'll keep paying for the service if it's good.

[18:50] Part of the reason that sometimes service businesses,

[18:52] even if the service should be sticky,

[18:54] they aren't sticky is because they need to the customers.

[18:57] So let me explain that.

[18:58] So if you have customers that are inherently volatile,

[19:01] then their volatility will reflect on the volatility

[19:04] of your product or service.

[19:05] And so if you're dealing with VSMB,

[19:06] so very small business owners or prosumers,

[19:08] people who just, you know, they have a job

[19:09] and they kind of upgrade those people

[19:11] and are totally volatile.

[19:12] They're going in and out all the time

[19:14] that you know, get passionate, get unpassed,

[19:16] they get whatever.

[19:16] And so it doesn't matter how good the thing is,

[19:18] you're gonna have a trend that's gonna be there.

[19:19] And so you have to make sure that you're comparing

[19:22] what you're expecting to turn

[19:23] where you want to get to, like Facebook has super high-churn.

[19:27] If you think about churn as people who stop using the product,

[19:29] now I'm say super high relative to Salesforce,

[19:32] but way better than every other social media platform.

[19:34] And so you look at Shopify.

[19:36] Shopify, I think is considered best in class.

[19:38] They have to think of,

[19:38] they think they have 55 or 60% renewal on an annual basis,

[19:42] meaning they lose 40% of customers every year.

[19:45] But the people who stick after that year,

[19:47] stick for the long haul.

[19:48] They're going to have involuntary churn

[19:50] in the lower on the axis you go.

[19:54] What you wanna make sure is that after people reach a milestone,

[19:57] they never leave.

[19:57] So that's what you're really going for.

[19:59] So if you have some period of time,

[20:00] let's call it 12 months,

[20:01] where people churn it out.

[20:02] And then after 12 months, no one ever leaves

[20:04] because they reach certain benchmark

[20:06] or a certain x-base, Asian points.

[20:07] If you get there, then you have a valuable business

[20:09] because those people, you just have this year

[20:11] up front that doesn't matter,

[20:12] and doesn't really factor the value of the business.

[20:14] But the valuable part of the business is,

[20:15] you do this functionally as a sales motion,

[20:17] in order to generate this reliable recurring revenue stat,

[20:20] and you're just filtering through to find the diamonds.

[20:22] So the question was,

[20:23] what kind of churn benchmarks exist

[20:24] so I know I'm doing good or bad?

[20:26] I can tell you on the school,

[20:27] because we have a lot of metrics there,

[20:29] 18% monthly churn is the average school community churn.

[20:32] So if you're doing 10%,

[20:33] you're doing basically about half that,

[20:35] so that's decent good.

[20:37] If you're above that,

[20:37] you probably have some things you can improve on.

[20:39] If you have five percent,

[20:40] so that means that you have 20 month LTVs,

[20:42] if you're like, how did you do that math?

[20:43] All you do is just take one divided by your monthly churn.

[20:46] So one divided 10% monthly churn

[20:48] means 10 months of average day.

[20:49] Five percent is 20 months,

[20:51] one divided by point.

[20:53] If you have one percent churn then you have 100, right?

[20:56] 100 months.

[20:56] What's good, what's bad?

[20:57] Well, the lower the better,

[20:59] the piece that I would really care about is M12.

[21:01] So the 12 month retention.

[21:03] How many people get to month 12?

[21:05] And of those people, what's my churn on them?

[21:07] If my churn on them is zero, then I'm very excited.

[21:10] If they're also just slowly churning out as well,

[21:12] then I just have this very long tail

[21:13] and I have to always keep selling people.

[21:14] Which, of course, every business has to keep selling people.

[21:16] The percentage is going to matter

[21:18] based on the industry and who you serve.

[21:19] File wide margin.

[21:20] If you're serving high end enterprise,

[21:22] then it should be 80% annual renewal or higher.

[21:25] If you're serving beginners, then it's going to be high.

[21:29] And that's also a feature not above.

[21:31] It's just part of selling to that customer.

[21:33] For me, what I care about fundamentally

[21:36] is the cost and the return of a permanent customer.

[21:38] So let me break this down.

[21:39] This is probably the most important thing to say.

[21:41] All we care about in any business

[21:43] is how many permanent customers do we have?

[21:46] So let's say that you have,

[21:47] for every 10 people who buy your education,

[21:50] three of them transfer over to your service

[21:52] and of the three of them transfer your service,

[21:53] one of them never leaves.

[21:54] Then we just have to know, okay,

[21:56] it costs me 10 times my current cost to a car customer

[21:59] to get one person who never leaves.

[22:02] What's that else you get a cat create show?

[22:03] If you're having just your else you get a cat create

[22:05] for front end business, that's different

[22:07] than else you get a cat else you do permanent.

[22:09] What's my permanent cat do permanent else you be?

[22:12] They just never leave.

[22:13] And if you're like, well, I don't really have that yet.

[22:15] Well, yeah, because that's the hard part of business.

[22:17] Once you figure out the product market fit

[22:19] of what's my feature stack,

[22:20] what type of customers that feature stack better,

[22:22] you know, better served for,

[22:23] so that 12 months are now, these people never want to leave.

[22:26] Once you solve that part, that is the hard part of business.

[22:29] That is the hardest question to solve.

[22:30] Once you solve that, then everything else is basically

[22:33] just math of how do I find more of those people

[22:36] and if I have to go through five to get to one,

[22:38] then this is one permanent customer

[22:39] and then just be able to cash full question,

[22:41] which is why people raise money,

[22:42] then they get really aggressive.

[22:43] But then you want to see like,

[22:44] okay, is there a way that I can either select

[22:45] better on the front end?

[22:46] Or is there a way that I can increase activations?

[22:48] Or it becomes one out of four?

[22:49] Is that a one out of five?

[22:50] But we have to get that one point,

[22:51] you have a permanent customer

[22:52] and then build backwards from there.

[22:53] When do you upsell other feature stacks?

[22:55] Well, it's gonna be based on their need.

[22:56] If someone comes in and has all of these needs,

[22:58] then you'd sell, naturally, at that point.

[23:00] If someone has one problem solved

[23:02] then creates another problem,

[23:03] a simple example would be like,

[23:04] hey, I teach both how to do DM setting or whatever.

[23:07] So you teach people how to reach out to people

[23:09] and create appointments.

[23:10] Okay, well, once they learn how to do it themselves,

[23:11] it's the next thing they're gonna want.

[23:12] They're gonna want other people to do it for them.

[23:14] And so if you want to sell service of placement

[23:16] for those people or sell some sort of fractionalized service

[23:18] where you have a pool of people that works for many people

[23:21] or you say, hey, I'll employ them myself

[23:22] so you don't have to do it with the liability or risk.

[23:24] But I charge 20% above and I pre-trained them

[23:26] and that's the ongoing rate.

[23:27] Fine, like these are all different business models

[23:28] you can have there.

[23:29] But you can't sell the GM Center.

[23:31] I don't think what you could up front,

[23:33] but likely they would have to have the business model

[23:35] understaining first and then you would upsell the room back in.

[23:37] So offer timing matters just as much

[23:39] if not more than the offer itself.

[23:41] Like sometimes you have the absolute right offer

[23:43] and you just offer it at the real time.

[23:44] So people say, hey, I really wanna start a business

[23:47] that has enterprise value.

[23:48] They'll say, I wanna real business.

[23:49] I don't think they're like,

[23:50] fundamentally, if you exchange good services for money

[23:52] then you have a real business.

[23:52] So you've got some, you've got to deal with your own head

[23:54] trash on that.

[23:55] If you define real businesses of business

[23:56] that becomes an asset that's sold to somebody else,

[23:58] fine, I understand that.

[23:59] But don't let anyone make you believe

[24:01] that there's something inherently wrong about the business

[24:03] you have.

[24:04] If you follow the law and you exchange good services for money

[24:07] and you make a profit then there's in the eyes of Alex,

[24:10] there's nothing wrong with what you do.

[24:11] You use the skills you got to provide for your family.

[24:15] I don't think there's any shame in it.

[24:16] I would dial that out.

[24:18] Beyond them.

[24:18] If you're like, I would just prefer to have a different business

[24:21] or I'd rather business doesn't rely on me.

[24:22] I'd rather business like it sell someday

[24:23] because I would ever go to that I have, fine.

[24:26] I have yet to see the, I'm going to use my cash flow

[24:29] for my education thing to feed my, you know,

[24:33] software or service business and then let that take off.

[24:36] Usually what ends up happening is that both businesses

[24:38] end up taking your attention

[24:39] and the service business doesn't put as much cash flow

[24:41] near the software company.

[24:43] And your lifestyle has already accustomed

[24:45] to the higher income level that you've generated

[24:47] from your high cash or business.

[24:48] And so you never really want to give it up

[24:50] because you don't want to take a lifestyle cut

[24:52] which most people can.

[24:53] And so they end up not being able to pursue it.

[24:54] If you do make the jump, you can win.

[24:57] So I'd be clear.

[24:58] Sam of it's from school.

[24:59] Head consulting.com, sold and shut down,

[25:01] consulting.com, went all in on school.

[25:03] Alex Becker with Hyros, had market hero,

[25:06] which is an education business, sold and shut that down,

[25:09] started Hyros when all the known Hyros made it work.

[25:12] And both have succeeded exceptionally well.

[25:14] Same same.

[25:14] If you want to do it, do it.

[25:16] But no half measures.

[25:18] Well hopefully that puts the nail in that coffin

[25:20] for this you were unsure about that.

[25:21] I get that question probably twice a month.

[25:23] And hopefully that just resolves that.

[25:26] And if you like this type of business breakdown,

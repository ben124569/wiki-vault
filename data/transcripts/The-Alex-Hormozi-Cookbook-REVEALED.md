[00:00] So you want to get shredded in 2024?

[00:01] Well, you're going to need lots of examples to transfer and to pick better parents.

[00:04] But if you're not going to do either of those things, I've got 12 protein pack recipes that

[00:08] require zero time, zero prep, and almost zero card.

[00:11] Almost zero fat and tons and tons of protein.

[00:15] This one is a returling of the protein and almost none of the other macros.

[00:18] I'm going to show you this recipe at the end of the video.

[00:20] First, let's talk about it.

[00:22] Chef Bro Rd to the rescue.

[00:24] So breakfast, the least talk about thing of the day.

[00:29] It's like breakfast and champions for old people.

[00:32] It's also great for games.

[00:33] So if you're somebody who struggles to eat enough, like I do, or if somebody eats too much,

[00:38] also works for you.

[00:39] I'm going to show you how to make a 100 gram protein bomb for zero prep in just a minute

[00:44] using stuff that you have at home that actually tastes delicious.

[00:47] So number one, I use this FIA yogurt.

[00:50] There's plenty of other brands.

[00:51] It doesn't really matter.

[00:52] I use this zero percent.

[00:54] This puppy has 94 grams of protein in it and just under 500 calories for this whole

[00:58] thing.

[00:59] And if you have this whole thing, it is filling.

[01:01] And for people who struggle with dairy, yogurt tends to do a little bit better than

[01:04] somebody who just drinks pure milk because it's already turned.

[01:06] It has some of those metabolites and all that fancy stuff that I know nothing about.

[01:11] That being said, I do know that if you eat that, compared to drinking a gallon of milk,

[01:14] that's easier on the stomach.

[01:16] Now, we're going to take something that's all natural and we're going to ruin it with

[01:19] lots of artificial flavors so that it's actually delicious.

[01:22] And you can use a bowl.

[01:23] What I usually do is I just put it in here because I don't like dishes.

[01:27] And I will take fruit punch.

[01:29] I like berry personally.

[01:30] There's different ones.

[01:31] There's like a berry singria.

[01:33] That's pretty good.

[01:34] And the nice thing with this is that these are always available everywhere.

[01:36] So if you travel and usually have your main stays at home, you're like, shoo, what

[01:39] do I do?

[01:40] Almost every grocery store nowadays has Greek yogurt.

[01:43] And so I put about half of one of these guys in.

[01:45] And this is like for a pitcher.

[01:46] So I figure this is about half a pitcher of fluid.

[01:49] So I put half of one of these guys in.

[01:51] And then I mixy mixy.

[01:53] Now, if you do need a bigger bowl because it doesn't make it easier to mix.

[01:56] Just for visuals, I'll show you guys.

[01:59] You put this guy in.

[02:00] That looks great.

[02:03] And then we just mix this guy.

[02:04] So this is my prep time.

[02:06] Can we start the timer?

[02:07] Here's my prep time.

[02:10] You also get nice little forearm pump.

[02:12] So you get a little pre-workout workout if you don't want to talk about.

[02:14] What's cool about this is it actually smells like yogurt.

[02:18] Or dannin or any of your favorite yogurt brands that we know and loved when we grew

[02:25] up.

[02:26] They were made by big farm and a kill us and all that stuff.

[02:30] Anyways, I like pretty pebbles.

[02:33] So this is my preferred cereal choice.

[02:37] Let's take this guy out.

[02:39] And so here's the cool part.

[02:41] Is that this can stretch a really long way.

[02:44] So a cup of this has 140 calories in it and 30 grams of carbs.

[02:49] Pretty much nothing else.

[02:50] It's almost all carbs.

[02:51] All right.

[02:52] So let me show you guys the fancy trick.

[02:53] So leave the actual cereal scooper as one cup in there so that you always know what you're

[02:58] getting every time.

[02:59] And so for me, I pull out my cup.

[03:02] Make sure it's even on the top.

[03:03] Don't give yourself a heaping scoop.

[03:05] All right.

[03:06] And then after that, I know I've got 140 calories of carbs.

[03:08] And so rather than mix them in because then they get soggy, what I'll do is I'll sprinkle

[03:13] some on top.

[03:14] Doesn't that look delicious?

[03:17] And then I'll peel off the first layer.

[03:19] They stay crunchy.

[03:20] And then I'll put the next layer on.

[03:24] And then I'll peel off the second layer.

[03:25] So I can actually have this nice fruity pebble crunch all the way through it.

[03:29] And you can see, I barely used a lot of my cup and I just did two kind of covering's worth.

[03:34] And you can use like a cup is plenty.

[03:37] You can do a half cup like if you're dieting because I've done this when I was dieting.

[03:40] If you use a half cup of this, it's 70 calories.

[03:43] It's 15 grams of carbs.

[03:44] And this thing's 500 calories of protein.

[03:47] We basically nothing else than it almost nothing else.

[03:49] And so that's my choice.

[03:51] It's like this is a filling breakfast.

[03:53] All right, you put all this in here.

[03:57] That is a filling filling breakfast.

[03:59] It looks like a massive bowl of cereal.

[04:01] Except this has almost 100 grams of protein in it.

[04:03] It doesn't take any time to prep.

[04:05] And if you eat it out of there, which is what I normally do, you don't even have any dishes.

[04:09] Let's see if it's as good as I remember it.

[04:11] Still delicious.

[04:16] By the way, if you do have a beard, beard nemesis.

[04:19] So definitely check yourself in the mirror before you leave the house.

[04:22] I'll just go to a pink ship all of your face.

[04:24] That pink said, let's go to the next one.

[04:27] By the way, I'm making these recipes because the last video I did show many of you guys

[04:31] come and just saying like give us a part two.

[04:33] So this is part two and we'll have the recipes in the link in the description.

[04:37] Enjoy.

[04:38] So this was a lunch that I had for like a couple of years because I tend to stick with

[04:41] the same thing for a really long time until one day I decide I'm going to have something

[04:45] different.

[04:46] But this is an awesome lunch.

[04:47] This is a ZQ bread which is just fancy organic, schmancy bread that has, I don't know,

[04:53] less preservatives, whatever.

[04:55] It's in the refrigerated section and it's like a dollar and a half more.

[04:57] Anyways, so I had this stuff because I figured if I'm going to have it every day,

[05:00] I try to eat better stuff.

[05:01] So that being said, take two of these guys and if you want to know,

[05:04] per slice, each slice of this thing is only 80 calories.

[05:07] Which is not bad for a slice of bread, especially given how like weighty it is.

[05:10] So some slices of bread are like kind of foamy.

[05:12] You could like mash it in your hand and put into a little,

[05:14] lady, bitty ball.

[05:15] This has more weight to it.

[05:16] So it's 80 calories.

[05:17] It's got five grams of protein in it, 15 grams of carbs and almost no fat.

[05:21] Now, if you like toast, which I do, there's speed toasters that can toast it in like half

[05:26] the time or third of the time and every minute is precious to me.

[05:29] So I have a speed toaster that I toast these guys in, but just to keep this video rolling,

[05:34] imagine these are toasted.

[05:35] Alright, so once it's toasted, what I do and I've experimented with different ways to eat

[05:40] this because I ate it every single day for like two years is I have fat,

[05:43] free cream cheese.

[05:44] Alright, so this is zero fat cream cheese, which you're like, how does that even work?

[05:49] Honestly, no idea.

[05:50] It's probably some sort of frankin food.

[05:51] It just kind of has the texture of cream cheese.

[05:53] I think they use milk to make it.

[05:55] Who honestly knows, I don't really care that much, but it tastes pretty good.

[05:59] The way to do this guy is, usually sometimes they'll have like little measurement things

[06:02] on here.

[06:03] If you have a scale because you want to be precise, awesome, I have done it enough

[06:08] times to know kind of like what a tablespoon looks like.

[06:11] And so that's about what that looks like.

[06:14] And by the way, these are a low fat locks, again, a low fat guy, which means it's pretty,

[06:19] if you have fish, it doesn't have carbs in it and you have fat, what's left?

[06:23] Protein.

[06:24] So this is pretty much close to the same macros as the chicken breast.

[06:27] Kind of cool.

[06:28] It is a little bit drier, just to be fair.

[06:30] But for me, I didn't really care that much, the taste was good enough for me and that worked.

[06:34] Different ways you can eat it.

[06:35] Version one is you put the cream cheese on and the layer that on top.

[06:39] I don't like that because the bread starts to get soggy.

[06:41] The next way you can do it is that you can put the salmon on here and then bite by bite,

[06:46] put the cream cheese on.

[06:48] That way does work because it doesn't like the same doesn't really make the bread wet.

[06:52] But the problem is that the salmon's really hard to bite into because then you pull the

[06:55] whole thing off of the bread.

[06:57] And so after eating this a lot of times, I have settled on the third way of doing it,

[07:01] which is that I actually mashed this guy up into like salmon tartar.

[07:05] All right.

[07:07] So I just cut the shit out of this thing.

[07:09] And I really, I'm not even trying to like grind it up.

[07:11] I just want to make it in big enough slices that if it comes like I'm not going to tear

[07:14] the whole thing off the bread when I eat it.

[07:18] So that I like I still have salmon that's on there when I'm eating it.

[07:22] All right.

[07:23] Tricks of the trade.

[07:25] Now once I have this, now what I'll do is I'll take my cream cheese, I'll throw this

[07:30] guy on, I'll put some of this on and then I just take my bite.

[07:34] And I just do that over and over and over again.

[07:36] And that has been how I ate it for years and years and years.

[07:39] So the bread stays crunchy.

[07:41] I don't have to accidentally eat half my salmon in one bite and then just eat plain

[07:45] ass bread the rest of the time.

[07:47] And the cream cheese steast stays cold because if the cream cheese is cold and then the bread

[07:51] is hot, they just end up being lukewarm and sucking.

[07:54] And so this day is crunchy and hot, this day is cold and creamy and then I have a

[07:58] biteable amount of salmon that doesn't tear off at once.

[08:01] And that is how I eat this thing.

[08:02] Now let's talk about macros real quick.

[08:04] Remember, this thing's all protein.

[08:06] This is more or less all protein.

[08:09] And this is low calorie.

[08:11] So if you didn't want to eat a z-kill, I would just say go with low calorie bread.

[08:14] I just try to minimize my carbon take unless I'm trying to eat them on purpose.

[08:18] And so I pretty much just eat protein throughout the day and then when I am going to eat

[08:21] carbs, never skip dessert, I go any carbs for real.

[08:25] And as many carbs I feel like.

[08:27] So like I said in the beginning, I try to eat around 100 grams of protein per meal.

[08:31] And so I would actually do three of these guys and that eat them is open face sandwiches.

[08:34] So I have fewer carbs overall.

[08:36] And so I put about four ounces of this protein locks on here.

[08:40] I'd have my bread and I'd have two, three, maybe five grams of protein that would come

[08:44] from the cream cheese.

[08:45] And so between the 20-ish that comes from this, the three to four that comes from this

[08:49] and the five that comes from this, I get about 30-ish grams of protein per open face sandwich.

[08:54] There's my 90.

[08:55] If you guys are paying attention at home, this is actually not enough salmon for what would

[08:59] be on one sandwich.

[09:01] So the salmon gets stacked up, this is protein.

[09:04] So I'm going to show you this because this is aesthetically what it would look like at a fancy

[09:07] restaurant.

[09:08] But in the brotastic kitchen, this is how much salmon would actually be on your sandwich.

[09:13] So I actually try to eat as much as I could on these open face puppies so that I could then

[09:19] get swollen.

[09:21] Alright, so there we go.

[09:24] Now I put it like this and I could take these massive man bites until I have three of these

[09:29] guys.

[09:30] So I'm going to throw away pounds of salmon for no reason because those salmon give their

[09:36] lives for us.

[09:38] Like that, boom delicious.

[09:43] So I have three of those guys, 90 grams of protein, all in calories, 240 calories from

[09:50] the bread, probably 102 from the cream cheese and the rest is just protein coming from

[09:55] the salmon.

[09:56] And if you have a beard, once you're done, you don't want to leave it in the space

[10:00] of the whole, wipe your face delicious.

[10:04] So we just crushed lunch.

[10:05] Now let's talk about snacks on the go.

[10:07] So two of my favorite snacks that you can go on the go that you can be pretty much anywhere

[10:10] in the content of the United States are you got jerky and you got light, keypoint, string

[10:15] cheese.

[10:16] Alright, so let's dive in.

[10:18] So we might not know and again, this isn't for all the healthy people.

[10:21] If you're going to be a healthy person, then just go watch another video.

[10:23] But if you just want protein, this is for you.

[10:26] Alright.

[10:27] Original jerky and I found this out later has a lot of protein in it.

[10:31] Alright, so this little guy has six servings of 10 grams of protein.

[10:34] There's 60 grams of protein in this.

[10:36] There's less than 500 calories.

[10:38] Not bad.

[10:39] It's just more than 80 calories, 60 grams of protein.

[10:41] And so it's not a bad snack that you're on the way on the go.

[10:44] So if you don't have time to eat or something like that, but you are a bigger guy and

[10:47] you need more calories.

[10:48] And if you're a smaller guy and if you're a calorie, just cut it in half.

[10:51] Alright.

[10:52] Now the other thing is string cheese.

[10:55] I use scoops of weight protein or pure protein sources as a good litmus test for, is this

[11:00] a sure or less pure protein source.

[11:02] Alright.

[11:03] So like if you have a, like the pureest version of this is you have a 120 calorie scoop of

[11:06] protein and a 24 grams ish of protein.

[11:09] That's about as lean as you're going to get in any kind of normal food.

[11:12] Now if you have four of these guys, it's 200 calories and 24 grams of protein.

[11:17] Alright.

[11:18] So not, I mean, really, really close.

[11:19] And the added amount that comes from this is fat.

[11:21] So there's two and a half grams of fat.

[11:22] There's almost no carbs on this.

[11:24] In the string cheese.

[11:25] And so if I have four string cheeses and this guy, I've got 84 grams of protein.

[11:31] And you're like, man, four string cheeses and all that.

[11:33] It's like, yeah, it's kind of like a meal, which is kind of the point.

[11:36] And so you can have this on the go and all in all, you'd be up 680 calories with 84

[11:42] grams of protein.

[11:43] And the stuff keeps great.

[11:45] So if you just want to have a snack on the go and you don't need 100 grams of

[11:47] one sitting, just open it up, open it, and then you're going to have a bar.

[11:52] Open top.

[11:53] Now all of them are done.

[11:55] But that one's okay.

[11:56] I'll put you the string cheese goes on with that one a little easier.

[11:59] But that's just a good drive.

[12:01] And you can pair this with a lovely, sweet, soft and young water.

[12:05] And this guy though, he's like, how do you fix string cheeses?

[12:09] You got to like, buy one, right through.

[12:12] And you're going to use a second one.

[12:14] Honestly, six string cheeses.

[12:16] It's just because they serve these like four year olds.

[12:18] But like, the string cheeses is just not the most cheeses.

[12:22] And it's like two bites.

[12:23] So it's really just seven, 12 bites of cheese.

[12:26] Because not nearly as much as you think about it.

[12:27] They just crack you like this so they can charge you more.

[12:29] There's not that much.

[12:30] It's this.

[12:31] It's not a lot of cheese, all right.

[12:33] There we go.

[12:34] It's like three bites.

[12:36] I'm remembering now why eat this.

[12:40] Jerky in the cheese actually tastes delicious together.

[12:42] It's meat and cheese.

[12:43] It's actually really good.

[12:44] So this is for those of you who were just rich and feel like spending more money but still

[12:46] don't want to have anything with protein.

[12:48] Very good on the next one.

[12:50] So I used to eat this when I was cutting.

[12:52] So this is my cutting diet.

[12:54] So this is shrimp that's been peeled and cooked already.

[12:59] So you can get this from the freezer section or if you're really fancy you can get

[13:02] from the fresh section.

[13:03] I've for the freezer section because it's cheaper.

[13:05] So for all you fancy motherfuckers, boom, shrimp which all you have to do is defrost it.

[13:10] This came pre all whatever.

[13:12] All right.

[13:13] So you just let it thaw.

[13:14] All right.

[13:15] The way that I did is I did it under the sink because it thaws it faster.

[13:17] And then it just comes cold-ish.

[13:19] And then you take this puppy.

[13:21] This is top cocktail sauce which by the way has 30 calories per quarter cup which you're

[13:27] not going to have more than like a quarter cup anyways.

[13:29] All right, maybe two.

[13:31] All right.

[13:32] So this is probably a half cup maybe.

[13:35] And so I got 60 calories of tartar sauce.

[13:37] So what I got to do is dip one of these puppies in.

[13:39] This is the fancy eating instruction.

[13:41] Perfect product.

[13:42] That's that.

[13:43] Very easy.

[13:44] You do whatever you want.

[13:46] And nice thing is that most people can, and most of your allergic to shrimp.

[13:49] Most people die just shrimp pretty well.

[13:51] And so the nice thing is that usually shrimp has a lot of volume.

[13:53] And so it's very filling.

[13:54] At least I found it filling.

[13:56] And so if you want to be fancy, you can do that.

[13:59] And if you want to be a little less fancy, you can have like 8 ounces of chicken and 8

[14:03] ounces of shrimp.

[14:04] Or if you want to be a little less fancy, you can still feel fancy and have 4 ounces of shrimp

[14:06] and 12 ounces of other shit.

[14:08] It doesn't really matter.

[14:09] It's all just protein.

[14:10] But the cool thing about shrimp specifically is that shrimp has zero carbs and zero fat.

[14:14] The thing is pure protein.

[14:16] So unless you add fat to it or you add carbs to it, there ain't going to be any.

[14:20] All right.

[14:21] So the only thing in this meal that has anything besides protein is just the cocktail

[14:25] sauce.

[14:26] And this thing like a little bit goes a long way.

[14:28] And I barely even count this stuff when I was even it.

[14:30] So now that we finished our fancy fancy shrimp shrimp dinner dinner, now let's talk about beef

[14:35] and cauliflower.

[14:36] All right.

[14:37] So this one is one that is a classic.

[14:39] Also one that I ate a lot when I was dieting because I needed to really get my protein

[14:44] up and my calorie is down.

[14:46] But all I do is I have the leanest ground beef that I can find.

[14:49] So this is 93.

[14:50] Usually you can find 96.4.

[14:52] If you find a good place that does it just get that, you can also do it with ground turkey.

[14:56] It doesn't matter.

[14:58] If you were really poor, I used to just buy chicken breast and then put them through a food

[15:02] processor, which I had for my dog at the time.

[15:05] And so I just feed them in and just grind them up for you.

[15:07] And now I just have all this ground chicken breast and that worked pretty good for me.

[15:11] So one is you've got your beef or your meat that's going to be lean.

[15:15] Two is you've got these microwaveable packets of rice cauliflower.

[15:18] All right.

[15:19] Now this stuff is heavy.

[15:20] Like it's very filling.

[15:22] And the nice thing with this is that if you've ever had an Uncle Banzer of quicker

[15:25] minute rice or whatever, it works the exact same way.

[15:28] All right.

[15:29] So you just crack the top, put it in the microwave and heat it up.

[15:32] Now, one thing I will say is that the beef usually prep at one point during the

[15:37] weeks.

[15:38] So you're going to have a few pounds of ground beef already, hopefully somewhere in your

[15:42] home.

[15:43] And then all you do is you've just got to add something to it so that it makes it into

[15:47] a meal.

[15:48] And that's why this is a no-prev deal.

[15:49] Now up to this point, you're like, okay, so you're just talking beef and cauliflower

[15:53] or like, why is this a meal?

[15:55] Good point because that own its own would be disgusting.

[15:58] And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you how I make a sauce that is both delicious

[16:02] and not nutritious in terms of its not-shocked packed with macronutrients, but it's

[16:08] actually just chocolate full of deliciousness and not a lot of cows.

[16:11] All right, so let's put these puppies together and I'll show you the secret sauce and

[16:15] we'll enjoy it together.

[16:16] So first things first, we're going to start with the meat.

[16:18] Look at that, come to know already.

[16:20] Man, we're a speedy.

[16:21] Who said this was zero prep anyways?

[16:23] So next thing is we got to take our cauliflower and we're going to nuke this thing.

[16:28] Great, so now we've got these two puppies.

[16:31] So how are we going to make this delicious?

[16:32] Because right now, this looks like dog food.

[16:34] Not agree with you.

[16:35] So we're going to enter secret ingredient number three, the sauce.

[16:39] So let's talk calories about mayonnaise.

[16:41] All right, so one first thing is that we actually accidentally bought the wrong one.

[16:44] This should be light mayo.

[16:45] Most light mayo is about 35 calories per tablespoon.

[16:48] This is this puppy.

[16:49] Now, if you want to not keep measuring shit spoon by spoon, which you can have lots

[16:54] of air, you just put the thing on a food scale and just see how many grams it is.

[16:57] It's much easier way to do that.

[16:58] But for the visual demonstration purposes of this video, let's rock with it.

[17:02] So if I've got a hundred and call it three calories that I want to eat.

[17:06] All right, in terms of fat, I've got one of these guys.

[17:09] And the reason that the weighing it is kind of useful is because you always have some kind

[17:16] of leftover on the spoon, and so you're kind of counting the same thing twice.

[17:20] And so I like just weighing it, but it is what it is.

[17:23] All right, here we go.

[17:26] Now if you also want a little hack, use the spoon that you did the scooping with to do

[17:30] the mixing because that way you get to use some of the stuff that's on there that you

[17:33] had to get credit for in your calories.

[17:35] All right.

[17:36] 130 ish calories because each one is 35 times four, whatever, 140.

[17:41] There you go.

[17:42] 140 calories.

[17:43] All right, fantastic.

[17:44] Next one is hermosis secret special sauce, which is just a rock shot.

[17:50] All right.

[17:51] And so then this guy, I've actually, I just don't count calories in hot sauce because there's

[17:55] not enough to really give a shit.

[17:56] And so I put a little bit in depending on your desired hotness levels.

[18:00] Now I like a little spice to my stuff.

[18:02] All right.

[18:03] And we go a little mixy mixy.

[18:05] Ooh, you can even smell it.

[18:07] Ooh, that smells like pepper.

[18:09] And so it does.

[18:10] You're going to feel that tomorrow.

[18:11] You see well.

[18:12] Okay, fantastic.

[18:13] Now I take sweetness and add this in.

[18:17] So this is just DVF.

[18:18] If you want to use sponge that works too.

[18:20] All right.

[18:21] Now again, this is like spicy and sweet are to flavor.

[18:23] All right.

[18:24] I like to add a couple of them.

[18:25] You'll get a feel for it.

[18:26] Add one in.

[18:27] See if you like it.

[18:28] And then add another feel like, oh, I like this to be sweet.

[18:30] Because what ends up happening is when you put this whole thing together.

[18:32] This becomes this really nice, fatty, sweet spicy mayo.

[18:38] All right.

[18:39] Look at that.

[18:40] It's kind of fancy.

[18:41] All right.

[18:42] So check this out.

[18:43] So we combine our forces together.

[18:46] Boom.

[18:47] We've got our rice and our beef.

[18:51] And then we go mixy mixy again.

[18:53] And then we give you another hack.

[18:55] If you need to get sauce and want to stretch it for other.

[18:58] Instead of just like taking this and just dumping it in.

[19:00] What you do.

[19:02] Take a little bit of this.

[19:04] Dip your spoon.

[19:05] Go on top.

[19:06] And then take a bite.

[19:08] That's it.

[19:09] Actually, it's really good.

[19:10] So that's how it works.

[19:13] All right.

[19:14] And I do it that way because you can you be amazed at how many more calories you can get.

[19:17] If you just dip your fork or dip your spoon before you do it.

[19:20] And if you're really clever about it, I try to put the sauce on the bottom side of the utensil.

[19:26] So that it's like directly on my tongue.

[19:28] It feels like there's way more sauce, but there really isn't.

[19:31] And so that's how you can stretch 140 calories for a pound of meat.

[19:33] So now that we just did a little spicy spicy, let's do something sweet.

[19:36] I'm going to show you the nastiest geto fabulous way to get protein.

[19:40] You've possibly ever seen.

[19:41] And it's so weird.

[19:42] You're probably going to try it.

[19:43] All right.

[19:44] This is 100 grams of protein in one serving with zero preparation of any kind.

[19:49] This is the only food on the market that I'm aware of.

[19:52] That you can literally take off the shelf.

[19:54] Get 100 grams of pure protein with no fatter carbs.

[19:56] And it is egg whites.

[19:58] Now you're like, well, how are you going to zero prep egg whites?

[20:00] Well, something you might not know is that egg whites are ultra-passed rice.

[20:03] So when I even pasted rice, they're ultra-passed rice, which is why you give you

[20:05] little expiration dates on eggs.

[20:07] They're like super far in the future because there's almost no bacteria in it.

[20:09] All right.

[20:10] Now.

[20:11] So I'm going to be like, okay, well, what is you going to do with the bowl?

[20:13] Great question.

[20:14] I actually only have this here, so you can see it.

[20:15] All right.

[20:16] But this is how you do it.

[20:17] And you're like, wait, Hershey Sierra, zero sugar.

[20:19] Yeah.

[20:20] Now you're getting what I'm going with this.

[20:21] Now if you grew up having chocolate milk as a kid, which I didn't.

[20:25] That's why I didn't want me to be fat.

[20:27] But if you did, good for you.

[20:29] I did get them at school though.

[20:31] They had the little cards of milk.

[20:33] You know, they just created it.

[20:34] Yeah, I had some.

[20:35] And that was like one of my big sources of protein grown.

[20:37] Anyways, so what you do is step one.

[20:40] Take ultra-passed rice egg whites.

[20:43] I call these tall boys.

[20:45] All right.

[20:46] There are 20 servings of five grams of protein in this puppy.

[20:49] That is 100 grams of protein.

[20:51] There are exactly zero grams of fat.

[20:54] And it is an exactly zero grams of carbs in this entire thing.

[20:57] It is pure protein.

[20:59] And then we take pure delicious, where there's exactly zero grams of protein.

[21:04] And zero grams of fat in this.

[21:06] And probably just gelatin and fucking who knows what Frankenstein's piss.

[21:12] Anyways.

[21:13] And so you take this.

[21:14] All right.

[21:15] And there's 32 servings in here.

[21:16] And so a tablespoon, if you remember what the mayo looks like,

[21:18] it doesn't matter because there's not the meat calories in this anyways.

[21:20] It's five calories per tablespoon.

[21:21] All right.

[21:22] Put some of this in here.

[21:24] All right. That's probably like three tables in four tables.

[21:27] All right. And so what we're going to do is we're going to go mixy mixy.

[21:31] By the way, keep your finger on the top.

[21:33] Here's that.

[21:35] Mixy mixy.

[21:36] You can almost hear the gain of the loading.

[21:39] Thank you.

[21:44] That's it.

[21:45] Looks like this.

[21:49] Which is like chocolate egg whites.

[21:51] Salted salt.

[21:52] And if you want to add more in, you can.

[21:54] But I will say, after having drank many, many, many of these,

[21:58] Pro tip, drink 95% the last five is like kind of gritty.

[22:03] So I would just like taking 95 rooms protein called a W.

[22:07] And the thing is is like, if you had this entire thing,

[22:10] but everyone at home was like, wait, how much did he put in there?

[22:13] This whole thing is 150 calories.

[22:15] You're not going to use the whole thing.

[22:16] If you use a third of it, it would be 50 calories,

[22:18] which I didn't even use a fucking 20th of this.

[22:21] All right.

[22:22] So like, it's going to be okay.

[22:24] But you can make this thing as chocolate as you want.

[22:27] So that would be an extremely chocolatey, massive nonsense.

[22:31] Look at the texture here.

[22:33] Look how thick that is.

[22:35] Kind of delicious, right?

[22:36] Look at that.

[22:37] It's like real chocolate.

[22:39] This is a great way to start the day.

[22:41] So you can knock out half of your protein in a single sitting doing this.

[22:45] If you need it, 200 grams of protein.

[22:46] And if you just eat like a normal person, the other three meals of your day,

[22:49] you'll probably get 200 grams.

[22:50] While we're on the chocolate tray, let's keep it going.

[22:52] All right.

[22:53] So let's dive in.

[22:54] So one of the things I didn't know is that from your protein,

[22:57] it actually makes zero.

[22:58] And there's some other cereals that claim to be protein cereals,

[23:00] but let's be real if they're not really protein cereals.

[23:02] Just like a bunch of soy crisp, put together.

[23:04] That still have shit loads of carbs and fat.

[23:06] But this one's actually pretty good.

[23:08] So this is one cup of this guy.

[23:10] He's 180 calories and 20 grams of protein,

[23:12] which is basically the equivalent of,

[23:14] good.

[23:15] It's like a little bit more than literally pure protein in the scoop,

[23:17] and a little bit less than most protein bars.

[23:19] So like really pure version of protein.

[23:22] And so if we put a cup of this in,

[23:24] but let's be real.

[23:26] No one eats one cup of cereal.

[23:28] All right.

[23:29] So what we're going to do is actually a protein breakfast champions,

[23:31] and have one cup,

[23:33] wait for it, two cups, three cups.

[23:37] All right.

[23:38] So there we go.

[23:39] You got three cups of this puppy.

[23:40] This is 60 grams of protein.

[23:42] And then, open up one of these guys.

[23:51] Make sure it's good.

[23:52] Oh yeah.

[23:53] Well this is from the, this is a,

[23:56] I think this is March of 23.

[23:58] Ooh, it's a great vintage.

[24:00] Anyways, so we dumped this puppy in there.

[24:03] Which I'm really doing for visual effect,

[24:06] because what I would actually do is actually pour this in the bowl first,

[24:09] and then put one scoop at a time,

[24:10] and so I could keep the cereal crunchy.

[24:12] But it's a little bit more dramatic,

[24:14] despite for the visual cams.

[24:15] All right.

[24:16] And so we're talking about zero prep protein,

[24:18] 90 grams of protein,

[24:21] like almost the purest amount of calorie per calorie protein out there.

[24:25] This is all way though, so to be fair,

[24:28] if you were somebody who doesn't do dairy well,

[24:30] and this would not be for you.

[24:31] But if you do handled dairy well, which I do,

[24:34] this is just, this is a good time.

[24:38] So this is 700 calories,

[24:41] 90 grams of protein, and probably cheap a shit.

[24:44] So if you're broke, and you want some protein,

[24:47] that takes zero time to cook, and is delicious.

[24:50] I threw this puppy on the list,

[24:52] especially if you like chocolate, you can hit on milk.

[24:54] Enjoy.

[24:56] If you're riding this brotastic voyage with me,

[24:59] then you will love this one too.

[25:01] So this is a lunch meal or dinner meal.

[25:03] If you're kind of wild, you can even have a breakfast,

[25:05] just a pocket cycle path.

[25:06] The happening set, all we do is we take this,

[25:08] chicken of the sea can tuna, which I think is my favorite flavor of tuna,

[25:11] just because I like saying chicken of the sea,

[25:13] make sure that you have it in water rather than oil,

[25:15] so that there's not extra cows in it.

[25:16] You can open this guy with one hand,

[25:18] not really everyone uses two hands to do a can opener,

[25:20] ask the disabled, as I too soon.

[25:22] Anyways, that being said,

[25:24] this guy has 66 grams of protein,

[25:27] and only 300 calories.

[25:30] Ice cold, all right.

[25:32] So this thing has zero carbs,

[25:34] basically zero fat, and only protein.

[25:36] So one of the nice things with most seafoods,

[25:38] especially crustaceans, this is not crustaceans,

[25:40] but in general, tuna is a very, very lean protein,

[25:44] and so that's why it's lean.

[25:46] All right, so that's 66 grams of protein, 300 calories.

[25:48] That's step one in this puppy.

[25:50] Step two is where we take this faia,

[25:52] or phage, depending on how you want to say it.

[25:54] All right, take a three quarter cup,

[25:56] give this guy in here.

[25:58] By the way, we're invented these ones that had these little rims.

[26:02] Well done.

[26:03] Don't have affiliate links.

[26:04] Don't know what brand it is,

[26:05] but if you find those, then awesome one you.

[26:07] All right, we're going to put this thing here.

[26:09] I actually already this, but this is the second take,

[26:11] so deal with it.

[26:12] All right, that being said,

[26:13] this is now in total 300 calories of tuna,

[26:17] and 90 calories of yogurt,

[26:20] so 390 calories, but here's a cool bar.

[26:22] There's 86 grams, 84 grams of protein in this bowl,

[26:27] and less than 400 calories.

[26:30] So let's fuck this up with even less calories.

[26:32] All right, next one is yellow mustard,

[26:34] get so many calories there in this,

[26:35] whoo zero,

[26:36] and this one because it's zero cows,

[26:38] you can add, add, limit them,

[26:40] which is Latin for as much as you're fucking one.

[26:43] All right, so now what we do is you go,

[26:45] mix and mix, you'll notice,

[26:47] mix and mix is a common step in our no prep,

[26:49] or no prep fantasies.

[26:51] All right, mix and mix,

[26:53] also if you like pepper, pepper just kind of good in here,

[26:57] and some people like celery, but again,

[27:00] I don't care about prepping that much.

[27:02] I want to do like as little as possible to make something good,

[27:04] but if you like some texture,

[27:06] celery and cucumbers,

[27:08] salt and pepper, that kind of stuff works.

[27:10] I usually just go because I don't care enough.

[27:12] Pepper, I do usually have the table.

[27:14] I don't usually prep with that,

[27:15] it's kind of a little top.

[27:16] All right, so now we just got this delicious,

[27:18] yellow-looking mustard bowl,

[27:20] and remember, we only have 390 calories though,

[27:23] so like this is a meal.

[27:24] Like this is like,

[27:25] this is 84 grams of protein,

[27:26] less than 400 calories.

[27:28] If you have 3-ease everyday, you probably be pretty full.

[27:30] You'd also be lean-ish shit because it'd be less than 12-hour calories a day.

[27:33] All right, so we take this,

[27:35] set spoon, put it on, set bread,

[27:38] make a bite,

[27:41] go set,

[27:42] you need to be,

[27:43] and if you have a beard, get it again,

[27:46] check yourself before you leave that.

[27:49] All right, you psychopaths,

[27:50] we're going from lunch to breakfast again

[27:52] because you can't go in order.

[27:54] Here we are.

[27:55] All right, so what we're going to do is,

[27:57] we're going to take one of this egg whites that has all the Hershey milk stuff in it.

[28:00] Well, I forgot to bite two of these for this video.

[28:02] So, so,

[28:03] so there's only going to be one milk,

[28:05] but we're going to pretend like this is clear,

[28:07] even though this is going to look like dark chocolate eggs.

[28:09] But you know what?

[28:10] It might be delicious,

[28:11] so we'll find out.

[28:12] All right, so we're going to take our egg whites,

[28:14] but it's a nice and chocolatey, all right.

[28:16] And remember, this whole puppy has 100 grams of protein in it.

[28:19] Here's why this is cool.

[28:20] Is that if you don't drink the eggs,

[28:22] you can just nuke them

[28:24] because you don't need a pan to cook them.

[28:26] So, a lot of people don't know this,

[28:27] but you can just microwave these guys

[28:29] and they just fluff right up.

[28:30] So, usually they actually have the directions on the thing,

[28:33] and if they don't, they have it on the Google.

[28:35] Cool, so let's go microwave these puppies over here.

[28:38] I just googled it and said 90 seconds,

[28:40] so we'll find out by the way,

[28:41] look at this fancy cookbook that we made.

[28:43] For you guys, feel free,

[28:44] thank the team.

[28:45] They put that together,

[28:46] you guys, so hopefully you guys can just get more jacked

[28:49] because you doesn't want a more jackamization.

[28:51] I know.

[28:52] All right, so 90 seconds.

[28:54] While the microwave is cooking,

[28:56] let me show you a little special addition,

[28:58] fire.

[28:59] I'd give you guys the birdie pebbles

[29:00] and crystal light fruit version.

[29:02] There's also a cinnamon toast crunch version

[29:04] that I have.

[29:05] I think done pretty good with.

[29:06] All right, so same original base of fire,

[29:09] but here's the difference.

[29:10] Is that in the fire,

[29:11] instead of squirting in crystal light,

[29:13] you're gonna add in vanilla extract.

[29:15] Mixing mixing, add in one or two packets

[29:17] of your fake sugar of choice

[29:19] or real sugar if you feel like adding calories.

[29:21] I don't carry the way.

[29:22] All right, and then on top of that,

[29:24] instead of adding pretty pebbles,

[29:25] you go CTC like a king on top,

[29:29] sprinkle it and enjoy.

[29:31] And if you want to get fancy fancy and you're serving

[29:33] if you're lady,

[29:34] take some cinnamon,

[29:36] do a little dusting on top.

[29:37] We'll just kiss.

[29:39] Hmm, back to the microwave.

[29:41] All right, so look at this.

[29:43] Looks like a souffle.

[29:45] All right, so we got our eggs,

[29:47] all souffle,

[29:49] which is French for blah, blah, blah, blah.

[29:52] Which is got a funny.

[29:54] All right, so we got our egg whites here.

[29:56] And obviously, you know,

[29:58] chocolate egg whites probably delicious

[29:59] and it's probably dusting,

[30:00] so tastes like a souffle.

[30:01] But if you're less fancy than me,

[30:03] which maybe you are,

[30:04] or maybe you're more fancy than I am,

[30:06] I just use canned salsa,

[30:08] all right,

[30:09] and we're just gonna pop this puppy.

[30:11] All right, and what I do is,

[30:12] again, I don't count calories on hot

[30:14] because I just don't care.

[30:16] Like this whole thing is 150 calories

[30:18] for this whole mama jamba,

[30:20] and I'm not gonna have anywhere close to,

[30:22] you know, anything reasonable on this.

[30:24] So I'm just gonna put some sauce on here.

[30:28] And like, that's it.

[30:29] Now, imagine this is white instead of chocolate.

[30:31] But it's actually really nice.

[30:33] Really easy to do.

[30:34] Now, here's the thing.

[30:35] Is I made like a cup, maybe, of eggs.

[30:40] If this thing was this whole tall boy,

[30:43] I'd need a bowl like this.

[30:45] Like egg whites blow up

[30:48] in terms of size.

[30:49] And so if you are somebody who's like on an extreme diet,

[30:52] or somebody who's like a huge appetite,

[30:54] and you need to be full,

[30:56] doing a tall boy of this and actually cooking the eggs

[30:59] is a mountain of food.

[31:01] And so that's why I drink them rather than eating

[31:04] because I don't even have the appetite to eat that much.

[31:06] Even on like dieting and starving,

[31:08] I don't have the appetite to eat that.

[31:09] But if you're somebody who has that salsa,

[31:12] plus egg whites, plus microwave,

[31:14] zero prep, zero skill, all protein,

[31:17] all delicious all the time.

[31:19] So, now they're done with the salsa,

[31:21] and eggs.

[31:22] Let me tell you what I actually eat from breakfast every day.

[31:24] The world's shortest and easiest 84 grams of protein,

[31:27] that's 230 calories apart, 460 in total.

[31:29] So 84 grams of protein,

[31:31] 460 calories, all delicious.

[31:34] Honestly, fair life you guys did a gift to humanity

[31:37] by coming out with this.

[31:38] This is only recent, by the way.

[31:39] Until like, not that long ago,

[31:41] which had to eat chalk dust mixed with bullshit.

[31:44] And I was going to do it.

[31:46] Hey, we're going to do it for the games.

[31:48] But these are actually really good.

[31:49] These just taste like chalk and milk.

[31:50] I prefer vanilla.

[31:51] I obviously have chalk and I'm, I mean, I'll drink them both.

[31:54] They're both very good, but vanilla tastes like melted ice cream.

[31:56] It's really good.

[31:57] And this is how easy it is to prepare and make this.

[32:01] I think this is a sour mouth.

[32:03] This is probably bottled in July.

[32:05] Just a hint.

[32:06] You can taste some of the floor all undertones.

[32:08] All right.

[32:09] So last but not least, in the recent end doing this one is because I actually fucked up one of the allowers.

[32:13] Other draw up dishes so I couldn't do it.

[32:15] But this is actually what I have for breakfast, but these anyways.

[32:17] All right.

[32:18] So, let's go.

[32:19] I'm going to do it.

[32:20] I'm going to do it.

[32:21] I'm going to do it.

[32:22] I'm going to do it.

[32:23] I'm going to do it.

[32:24] I'm going to do it.

[32:25] I'm going to do it.

[32:26] I'm going to do it.

[32:27] I'm going to do it.

[32:28] I'm going to do it.

[32:29] I'm going to do it.

[32:30] All right.

[32:31] So that being said, let's do lapistichasistos, cougar, right?

[32:36] Couducas, we want to get fancy on it.

[32:38] All right.

[32:39] Bro nachos.

[32:41] So there are three ingredients in bro nachos or protein, bro tato chips.

[32:47] They are as follows.

[32:49] Number one, Quest, cool ranch chips.

[32:52] Side note.

[32:53] This is the, in my opinion, the best flavor they have.

[32:55] Bile long shot.

[32:56] I mean, the other ones are fine, but like these border line tastes like chips.

[32:59] These are really, really good.

[33:02] So number one, Quest, ranch chips.

[33:05] Number two, Horamel chili.

[33:08] Delicious.

[33:09] Make sure that you get no beans because you want beef in there.

[33:12] What's cool about this is there's lots of protein.

[33:14] It lasts forever.

[33:15] You can buy them in bulk.

[33:16] I'll tell more about this stuff later.

[33:18] Number three is Lafayet or phage depending on how you feel like pronouncing it.

[33:23] Also more protein.

[33:24] You've noticed this is a common theme.

[33:26] And number four, side side.

[33:28] All right.

[33:29] So let's rock and roll.

[33:30] Let's go over the macros real quick.

[33:31] So number one, this is 140 grams.

[33:32] Sorry, this is 140 calories.

[33:34] 19 grams of protein.

[33:36] I mean, this is leaner than most protein bars in terms of calorie content.

[33:40] And I think they're delicious.

[33:41] Like this is, this gets close to just what a chicken breast is.

[33:44] So like really, really pure source of protein and also delicious.

[33:48] This, Horamel chili is, is, is 520 calories per can 30, 30 grams of protein.

[33:57] So a little bit fat here.

[33:59] But again, we're making a meal here and I'm trying to make this

[34:01] Protastic.

[34:02] All right.

[34:03] So there's that.

[34:04] So that's 520 calories.

[34:06] This guy, we've already covered it from earlier.

[34:08] And then salsa usually has no calories.

[34:10] This is 5 calories per serving.

[34:11] 50 calories for the whole thing.

[34:12] So let's assume that I want to have a Protastic voyage.

[34:15] And we're going to go on it together.

[34:18] So number one is, we're going to try and eat a lot here.

[34:22] All right.

[34:23] So let's make 100 grams of protein per the use.

[34:26] All right.

[34:27] So we're going to go two, two bags of chips because why not?

[34:31] All right.

[34:32] So that gets this 40.

[34:33] Right up the bat.

[34:35] Now obviously guys, you can cut it in half.

[34:37] And if you're a little lady, be a little lady, be a little lady, be a girl,

[34:41] a little lady guy.

[34:42] You can just half half.

[34:43] All right.

[34:44] All right.

[34:45] So we got 40 grams of protein so far.

[34:46] All right.

[34:47] Now we're going to take our 4-mail chili.

[34:49] So we're going to do here is we're going to,

[34:52] this guy here.

[34:54] There we go.

[34:56] All right.

[34:57] And then we're going to put a little chili on there.

[35:00] Little spoony spoon.

[35:02] Ooh yeah.

[35:03] Oh yeah.

[35:05] Oh yeah.

[35:07] There we go.

[35:10] All right.

[35:11] So now we got 70 grams of protein.

[35:14] And we need 30 more.

[35:18] And obviously, if you want to like have more protein,

[35:21] you could just have a leaner meat.

[35:22] This is just fun and easy.

[35:24] Because I said earlier, I wanted to have no prep stuff,

[35:27] so that's no prep.

[35:28] All right.

[35:29] And so we need 30 grams more, which is going to be one and a half cups.

[35:31] This is two cups.

[35:32] This whole thing.

[35:33] So it's basically going to be most of this.

[35:34] All right.

[35:35] There's one.

[35:37] All right.

[35:38] Left about five, a quarter in there.

[35:42] All right.

[35:43] Now you could probably just do this and be pretty happy about it.

[35:48] But I like, through a little sauce on there.

[35:53] And just like that, take your chips, you take your.

[36:02] Take your shark cream, take one of these guys, go on top.

[36:07] Get it.

[36:08] Get it.

[36:09] There you go.

[36:10] There you go.

[36:11] And.

[36:13] Honestly, it's farce.

[36:14] It's great.

[36:16] It's really delicious.

[36:18] It's actually good.

[36:20] And um, this is food.

[36:22] And so this is how we'll make it for camera.

[36:26] Real life.

[36:27] I'll take a bowl.

[36:28] I start with the chili.

[36:30] I put this out.

[36:31] I'm going to top and have this salsa.

[36:33] I'll take the chips.

[36:34] I would dip it in.

[36:36] That way the chips take crunchy doesn't look nearly as cool.

[36:38] But that's what I would actually do.

[36:40] All right.

[36:41] And so that is the broadcasting voyage of nachos and protein.

[36:45] It is 12 ways that you can have zero prep.

[36:48] Zero intelligence 100% protein as little fat and a little carbs, a

[36:52] Sheemly possible while having maximum deliciousness in little time.

[36:55] And if you make a mozimeo tag me on Instagram or Twitter.

[36:59] I'm going to be resharing the best one.

[37:00] And if you guys find something that's even more delicious than the 12 that I had.

[37:04] Is zero prep at the 100 grams of protein that takes almost no time tagging that shit.

[37:09] Because I might try myself without definitely sharing it.

[37:11] So thank you guys.

[37:12] Keep an awesome.

[37:13] But we guys have an amazing 24 get a shred of it as you want.

[37:16] And uh, one of these meals actually gets into your rotation and becomes the main

[37:21] steak.

[37:22] And for x-rated food content like this.

[00:00] In this video, I get really in depth on the actual scaling of a sales team process,

[00:03] the training process, the onboarding process, the management process, etc.

[00:06] So that you can scale sales within your organizations.

[00:09] The interview process we're testing for is the speed of response.

[00:13] You can test work ethic by how quickly they get back to you because you are a lead to them.

[00:16] Number two, somebody who's intelligent.

[00:17] So if somebody sounds like an idiot, then the impression that they're going to be giving up your brand.

[00:20] The next one is you want somebody who can listen.

[00:21] So someone's dominating the conversation, they're talking, they're motor mouthing.

[00:25] It's not a good idea.

[00:26] You want somebody who's kind of an anambiver.

[00:27] If somebody can listen and can talk when it's time and socially aware, you want somebody's

[00:30] coachable.

[00:31] So you can measure coachability by saying, hey, I want you to role play with me in the situation.

[00:35] And you just give them a little bit of context.

[00:36] I don't care about how well you sell me.

[00:38] I just want to hear you talk through things.

[00:39] And then what you'll do is you'll give them feedback and the ask them to try again.

[00:42] Now if someone can take the feedback without an ego, then you have somebody who's coachable.

[00:46] And if they make improvement on the second try, then you know that they can improve.

[00:49] If someone is not coachable and they do not take the feedback, well, you can already know

[00:52] way ahead of time that they're going to be terrible for that.

[00:53] Now at this point, they have to transition their general knowledge of sales to your specific

[00:56] product or service.

[00:57] Now, I think one of the things that's over-emphasized is product knowledge and what's

[01:00] under-emphasized is prospect knowledge.

[01:02] What we should be focusing on is who are we selling to more than what are we selling, because

[01:06] who matters more in the sale of the person or the product, the person.

[01:08] Right?

[01:09] So we want to understand their problems so in depth because if you can explain to somebody exactly

[01:13] the problem that they're going through, they will buy whatever you have because they will

[01:15] believe that you so intrinsically understand what they're going through.

[01:18] Once we've decided to hire this person, I like to have a 14 day onboarding period.

[01:22] What is covered in the onboarding period is that we want them to listen to sales calls

[01:25] that are good.

[01:26] Now, if you don't have any sales calls that are good, like I would recommend you go and

[01:29] sell and do it well and then record those calls and have them listen to it.

[01:32] You want them to be bathing in good sales.

[01:34] All they're doing, all day long is listening to sales calls and you can see if they

[01:37] watched it based on most software.

[01:39] Once they've watched, let's say about 40 different sales calls, they're going to have

[01:42] a pretty good idea.

[01:43] Now in between those watchings, you want them to work on the script.

[01:46] The script should be in my opinion, a question-based framework.

[01:49] It's a framework of questions that leads someone to actually conclude.

[01:51] When I review the sales groups of our portfolio companies, and they're trying to improve,

[01:54] there wasn't a core decision that was articulated.

[01:57] The sales people in general would, most of the time, they say, do you have any questions

[02:01] for me?

[02:02] Do you have any questions for me?

[02:03] That's in indication that the sales person doesn't know how to close.

[02:05] Clearly not following the script.

[02:06] Because you're not asking the prospect to come with more reasons to not buy.

[02:10] You're asking them to make a decision.

[02:11] It's you have to be very clear at the beginning of the call, which is clarifying why we're

[02:14] here.

[02:15] And then labeling them with the props.

[02:16] That's the closer framework.

[02:17] Clarifying why they're there.

[02:18] Label them with a problem.

[02:19] Overview their past experiences and pains.

[02:20] Once you have that and you've got enough info, you say, cool, I think you'd be a good

[02:22] fit and I'll tell you about it.

[02:23] Invite it to sell, which is the S.

[02:25] And then you explain very short analogies why you think you're going to be able to solve

[02:29] two to three of the problems that they explained.

[02:30] And then you ask for the sale.

[02:31] And then ENR are explaining whether they're concerns in the reinforcements.

[02:34] And so once we have a script, do you want to foil down the decision to the most basic

[02:39] unit possible?

[02:40] And the reason you have to do that thinking is because you don't want them to try and

[02:43] think about the decision is you want to give them the decision that they have to make

[02:46] by the end of the call.

[02:47] And so if you were selling a B to B service, it would be like the decision we have to make

[02:49] is whether you're going to make more money on your own than you will with us in access

[02:53] to our fate.

[02:54] What most people do is they just talk for 30 minutes and then they just present the price

[02:57] and they just don't have any structure to the conversation and they don't actually

[03:00] do any fact finding.

[03:01] They go on off all of these all these tangents.

[03:02] Why are you here?

[03:03] What is your problem?

[03:04] What have you tried to solve?

[03:05] Here's how I think we can help you give them what you just said to make this one decision

[03:08] which is can we help you more than you could on your own?

[03:10] Yes or no.

[03:11] Fantastic.

[03:12] Close.

[03:13] That's it.

[03:14] Once we've clarified what that script you need to look like and that's a big picture.

[03:15] There's obviously wording but for the sake of this video I want to talk bigger.

[03:18] So once you have that and this person is washed themselves and sales, they're studying

[03:22] the script.

[03:23] What you want to do is you want to role play with them and you want to role play with

[03:25] them every morning during their process so they get better at it.

[03:27] Once they pass the role play test, right?

[03:29] And if you're like whoa that's always going to work well.

[03:31] It is a lot of work to build a great sales team.

[03:32] Once they sell you on them being able to have the sales conversation then you put them

[03:37] on the floor on a half schedule.

[03:38] Now I'm going to give them a full schedule because you want them to blow through a ton

[03:40] of leads.

[03:41] You give them a half schedule.

[03:42] The second half their date they're still reviewing the calls they had and then you're

[03:44] still meeting with them twice a day.

[03:46] Beginning the day and a day.

[03:47] The second week of this training when you're reviewing the sales costs with them, they now have

[03:51] fresh ones that they went through that you're going to give them feedback on.

[03:54] Here's how you have these meetings.

[03:55] When you do sales manager meetings, you're communicating the goals which in sales is usually

[03:59] pretty straightforward.

[04:00] You're making sure they're motivated and then you're training them.

[04:02] That is the point of the job.

[04:03] You motivate and you train as long as they're clear with their KPIs are.

[04:06] 30 minutes before the call that you have with the new trainee, you listen to one or two

[04:11] of their sales calls at 2x, you know, speed, take written notes of all the things that you

[04:15] would want to improve.

[04:16] When you get on the call with them which would have an immediately afterwards, it's going

[04:18] to be fresh in your mind.

[04:19] You then look at your notes and then you want to bold or prioritize one to two highest

[04:23] impact things that they can do.

[04:25] Now there's probably a hundred things that are going wrong.

[04:27] But you just want to start with the highest impact things and then you give them those

[04:30] things and it takes about five minutes to communicate that.

[04:32] 30 minutes to review and write the notes, five minutes to communicate the thing that the

[04:35] one to two highest leverage things that they can do to improve.

[04:38] And then 25 minutes where you roll play again with them with the new changes.

[04:41] And then they go back to the next day, they do more calls, you listen to see if they did

[04:44] the thing.

[04:45] They didn't do the thing, they roll play again.

[04:47] Go next day, you listen to recordings.

[04:48] Now maybe they got it right.

[04:49] You say, hey, keep doing that.

[04:51] You're getting better.

[04:52] Now let's also do this thing.

[04:53] When someone says I got to think about it, when someone says I have to talk to my spouse, when

[04:55] someone says, that's a lot of money.

[04:57] Let's drill this over count.

[04:58] This is what I need you to say.

[04:59] You have to flex that muscle as many times as you can get those reps in within that 25 minute

[05:03] period.

[05:04] And so as you're scaling a sales team, you need to do that with all of the reps.

[05:07] That is what sales management is.

[05:08] It's not just like sitting there having one weekly meeting and checking on people and asking

[05:12] them what their pipelines are.

[05:13] You need to be reviewing sales calls with written notes, prioritizing where they can improve

[05:17] the most and then communicating and drilling them on those things.

[05:20] Retaining the culture of the team through three things.

[05:23] One is having a leaderboard that is visual and up to date at all times.

[05:27] Sales people are competitive, you want to foster that competition.

[05:29] Number two is that you want to have clear KPIs and some sort of bonus.

[05:33] We like every 30 days to 42 days, every 4 to 6 weeks, having some sort of big little thing

[05:37] that they can brag about winning some sort of sales competition.

[05:40] Of the different objectives that we have optimized for, you won that has worked best for

[05:43] all of our portfolio companies is optimizing for cash up front.

[05:46] Number three things.

[05:47] One is the leaderboard.

[05:48] Two is the KPI competition and the three is that you have to cut the bottom 10% on a quarterly

[05:53] basis.

[05:54] If you're not cutting, you're communicating the team that's okay to suck and it will drag

[05:57] down the culture of the team.

[05:58] And so the job of the manager besides the training is motivation.

[06:01] The motivation comes for culture and the standards that we set for ourselves.

[06:03] And what you agree to coloring and so fundamentally sales management is a skill of tolerance.

[06:08] Is the person who tolerates the most is one of the weakest teams.

[06:11] You can tell the difference between the winning teams and the losing teams usually

[06:13] by the coach.

[06:14] You have one coach go from a losing team and the NFL to almost undefeated team in one

[06:19] year because of the leadership because of the culture because of the modia because

[06:22] we say we no longer tolerate these things.

[06:24] Like if you want to be here, this is a world class sales organization.

[06:27] And if you were on the team, it means that you were bringing to them.

[06:29] There was a time a few years back where our sales team had a little bit bloated, got a little

[06:32] bit fat and so I ended up cutting more than half the team and then I had a meeting with

[06:36] everybody afterwards.

[06:37] And I wanted to reset the tone and I was like guys, if you're here is because A, we

[06:41] value and we think that you're a solid.

[06:43] But B is because we think that you're going to buy into the vision of what we have for

[06:46] the future, which is we want to build a world class sales organization.

[06:48] And if you want to stay on this team, that means that you're agreeing to that.

[06:51] And I don't want to say that you're inherently agreeing to that.

[06:53] I want to let you guys sleep on it because tomorrow, if you want to quit, that's fine.

[06:56] You just let me know in the morning.

[06:57] No harm of foul.

[06:58] I'd rather you just tell me because what we're going to go through is going to be a significant

[07:00] change.

[07:01] And so if your sales manager is coming into an organization is a visa, then you stand

[07:04] out of what we will do.

[07:05] I expect you to all attend our 5 a.m. training for an hour where we drill together.

[07:10] I expect you to show up on time to every single call.

[07:13] I expect you to clean your pipelines every single day and that you put the call notes

[07:17] in the CRM as required.

[07:19] If you do not do those things, even if you're the best close in the team, I will fire you.

[07:22] Are we clear?

[07:23] And the reason I do that is because I want to cultured this team to be one of excellence

[07:26] in everything we do because if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well.

[07:29] And so you have to set that tone on the team to get them to want to raise up.

[07:32] And that's where the leadership of sales managers is so important.

[07:36] As a side note, I have rarely found that the best sales person is the best sales manager.

[07:39] Sales managers tend to be more giving in general and more stable as people.

[07:44] There's less emotional highs and lows.

[07:46] They are more even.

[07:47] They need to be the rock of the team that people look up to.

[07:50] No one respects a sales manager who says do all these things and doesn't do it themselves.

[07:53] And so they have to emulate or exemplify what work ethic looks like, what following through

[07:58] looks like, would finishing your checklist every day looks like, being first to show up

[08:02] for the meeting in the morning before everyone else does.

[08:04] Like you have to lead by example.

[08:06] The last piece I want to hit on here is the cadence, which is what frequency are we talking

[08:09] to ourselves people.

[08:10] The first 14 days you're going to be talking to that person once a twice a day when they're

[08:12] getting on board it.

[08:13] Once they get out of that training wheel spirit, which is the half week, if they meet

[08:16] the quote, which is the minimum allowable close rate or whatever metric you want to

[08:20] use, then they can get a full schedule.

[08:22] Once on the full schedule they're still kept on that and everyone understands that if you

[08:24] drop below KPI for two weeks, you go on a pep, which is a performance improvement.

[08:28] Which means you go basically regress back to being a training, which means I now have to

[08:31] train you the way we were and I'm going to take even more attention to fixing your calls

[08:35] and getting you back on track.

[08:36] And after the next two weeks you still haven't improved.

[08:38] You're all.

[08:39] That's the name.

[08:40] Now, when you hire people, you also set that expectation.

[08:42] This is how this works.

[08:43] This is a dangerous place to work.

[08:45] We do that because we expect excellence.

[08:46] You want them to be fired out.

[08:47] They're like, let's fucking go.

[08:49] The cadence after you've graduated someone from training to full time is you would meet

[08:53] with them on a weekly basis and then maybe after a year, every other week if they're just

[08:57] killing it.

[08:58] But most times, most salespeople meet on a weekly basis.

[09:00] Just to clean the engine, check in on things, give them a couple of tidbits, hear the

[09:03] amount, etc.

[09:04] The structure of those calls already outlined in terms of how you get feedback.

[09:07] That same feedback structure applies to all of these existing guys too, which is an hour

[09:11] per guy per week is for the sales management.

[09:13] It's easy to take 60 to here, maybe two calls because you can listen to it on faster

[09:17] rate.

[09:18] And then you can have your ridden feedback and after you have the call with them, you

[09:21] want to message them or email them the salient blocks.

[09:24] And if you're an organized person which I recommend you be a firm manager, I like having

[09:27] a tab of all my salesguys and having the things that I want them to work on each week

[09:31] so that I can just date it.

[09:32] And then they say like last Monday, I said these two things, come back this Monday.

[09:34] And so when I'm reviewing it the next week, I'm saying this is the two things that

[09:37] tell them to work on today and prove it.

[09:38] Yes, no, cool when I come back to that call.

[09:40] I'm like, hey, we said these two things that you do it.

[09:43] Did it results and you make you more deals.

[09:44] Awesome, cool.

[09:45] Big meeting cadence.

[09:46] You've got your weeklies.

[09:47] You've got your monthlies.

[09:48] You've got your 101 that happened on a weekly basis or more frequently if they're on a

[09:51] performance plan or a trainee.

[09:53] And then you have as a team, daily huddle, end of day huddle.

[09:55] The end of day is a short, just like, hey, how's it been doing?

[09:58] Checking in, cool, awesome.

[09:59] Make sure you clean your pipelines, et cetera.

[10:01] The early morning one is a training.

[10:02] If you want, you can make it optional.

[10:04] And if you're on a performance plan or your trainee, it's made of a toy.

[10:07] With the right culture teams, most guys always attend.

[10:10] That's the overarching structure for scaling a sales team and

[10:12] an organization.

[10:13] The only other thing that can happen is that they will lose conviction.

[10:16] That's when sales can get cold.

[10:17] The things that keep people motivated are the competitions because that keeps things fresh.

[10:20] Because it's a very repetitive job.

[10:21] But also reading testimonials of clients they recently

[10:25] sold in the results that they're experiencing.

[10:27] And you do that so that they feel like they're good guys.

[10:30] Because a lot of times sales can feel very hunting-kill.

[10:32] But you want to self-replace an empathy, genuine empathy, not nice guy.

[10:36] But I really want to help you, which means you need to make a decision.

[10:39] And that's what I'm not going to let you hide in your excuses again,

[10:41] because I really am trying to help you not say I am.

[10:43] Because I've seen guys just like you,

[10:44] change the lives by doing this.

[10:46] And I know you're just putting bullshit up.

[10:47] You're in your fray, and that's okay, because we're going to help you.

[10:49] You have to have somebody who's willing to push through the know because they believe in the product.

[10:54] And the transformation of the person's going to experience not because they have their ego tied into it.

[10:59] And they want to close the sale to be number one.

[11:01] You get their backwards.

[11:02] And you do that by having people who are clients, hop on a sales call,

[11:06] and talk about their experience.

[11:07] The second best thing is to watch videos of testimonials with the team before you start the day,

[11:12] and then early morning, hotdle.

[11:13] And then the third is just just read them out loud yourself.

[11:16] And ideally what you want is if you're going to read them out loud,

[11:18] have the guy who's sold the person, read the testimonials,

[11:20] then it'll double down on their conviction.

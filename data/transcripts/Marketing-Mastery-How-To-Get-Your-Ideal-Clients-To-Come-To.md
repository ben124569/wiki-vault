[00:00] What's going on everyone in this short video

[00:02] I want to tell you a story about how you can position

[00:05] or marketing the way that gets a lot more people

[00:08] to respond to it independent of whether you may like it or not.

[00:11] And so when I was starting out, right?

[00:15] I struggle to get people to buy what I knew would help them.

[00:19] So when I started in fitness, I wanted to say,

[00:21] hey, there's a sustainable way to look the way you want to look.

[00:25] You just need to learn how to count your macros

[00:27] and do resistance training.

[00:29] And if you do that, you look the way you want to look.

[00:32] But for whatever reason, my marketing that talked about that

[00:35] because I knew it was true, didn't get people to respond.

[00:39] And I didn't get any new customers, even though I knew,

[00:41] I was saying truth, right?

[00:43] And later on in my career, before I learned this lesson,

[00:48] I was doing marketing for a dentist.

[00:50] And I was running ads and we had landing pages that we had built

[00:54] and it was working.

[00:55] And he called me up furious.

[00:56] And he was like, this looks horrible.

[00:58] This is terrible for my brand.

[01:00] I would never sign up for something like this.

[01:02] And I was like, well, it's a good thing

[01:03] that you're not your customers.

[01:05] You already have nice teeth, right?

[01:07] And so the story that drove this home for me

[01:12] was a story that's become famous in our community

[01:14] called The Ham in the Garlic.

[01:15] And so the way the story goes is there's a little kid.

[01:19] And he was incredibly excited to please a stat.

[01:25] And his dad one day decides to give him a dog.

[01:28] And says, listen, son, you've got to take good care of the dog.

[01:31] And if you don't take good care of the dog,

[01:32] then it means you're not responsible.

[01:33] So you've got to take good care of it if we're going to bite.

[01:35] And he says, OK, so give him the dog.

[01:38] And so one day, the dad goes to work a couple weeks later.

[01:41] And the kid sees the dog he's playing with them.

[01:44] And you notice he's got ticks all over him.

[01:46] And he's like, oh my god, he's super distraught.

[01:48] He's at what am I going to do?

[01:48] What am I going to do?

[01:49] And so he runs over into the other room

[01:51] who's grandmother, who's looking after him all his dad's at work.

[01:53] And he says grandma.

[01:54] Like, what do I do?

[01:55] The dog's got ticks all over him.

[01:58] And the grandma says, ah, me, whole.

[02:00] You just have to give the dog some garlic.

[02:04] All right, so go feed him some garlic.

[02:05] And then the ticks will go away.

[02:07] So the kid goes and tries to feed the dog garlic.

[02:10] And the dog's moving his head, because it's supposed

[02:13] like garlic.

[02:13] He doesn't need it.

[02:15] And so he goes back to the grandma and says,

[02:17] grandma, I try the garlic.

[02:19] He didn't work.

[02:20] What do I do?

[02:21] And she says, me, oh, did you just

[02:22] try and give him the garlic straight up?

[02:24] And he's like, yeah, you have to wrap it in ham.

[02:29] Wrap it in ham first.

[02:31] Then feed it to the dog.

[02:32] And so he's like, OK, so he wraps it in ham.

[02:34] And goes to the dog, he eats it.

[02:35] And then a couple, you know, an hour later,

[02:37] the tick start crawling up the wall,

[02:40] because it's the dog starts, you know, sweating out

[02:41] or like whatever.

[02:44] And the kid feels saved because the dog is taking care of

[02:47] and the dad still's proud of him, et cetera.

[02:50] But the moral of the story is that you have to give

[02:52] people what they want in order to give them what they need.

[02:56] And so many times, people are not at the perspective

[02:58] from which they don't have the perspective.

[03:00] They don't have the context to understand what you're saying

[03:02] because you already in the know.

[03:04] And so you have to go back in time to before you knew

[03:07] what you knew what you know now and meet people

[03:09] where they're at and then walk them across the bridge

[03:12] to where you need them to go.

[03:14] And so when we started marketing fitness,

[03:15] we would market short duration challenges detox.

[03:19] It's things like that because we knew that people who were

[03:23] in that state of mind what they want is a quick fix.

[03:27] And so what we would have to do is we'd bring people

[03:29] and we'd give them what they want to get them to respond.

[03:32] And then once we earned their trust, we said,

[03:33] hey, I know you had a little bit, you know,

[03:35] we had some success in this first few weeks.

[03:38] But you're not here just for a few weeks

[03:40] because you don't want to gain it back, right?

[03:41] Of course not.

[03:42] You really want this to be a long term thing

[03:44] because if you lose it and gain it back, what's the point?

[03:46] And like, yeah, and it's like, and at this point,

[03:48] we said, this is the garlic, which you need to do

[03:50] is you need to learn how to count your calories,

[03:52] you gotta learn how to eat macros,

[03:53] and you gotta learn how to train for real.

[03:55] And so when we had that, we now had the context

[03:58] to have the truthful conversation with them

[04:00] and deliver the garlic, right?

[04:02] But it took the ham to get them in the door.

[04:05] And so right now, you may have something

[04:07] that you're trying to market in your business

[04:08] and you're trying to get in your customers in the door

[04:10] and you're marketing from a position of already knowing the answer.

[04:13] And that's the issue.

[04:14] And you may shake your fist at these other marketers,

[04:17] your competitors, they're like, man, they're marketing

[04:20] short duration things, they're marketing these whatever.

[04:23] But they're probably marketing it because it's working for them.

[04:26] And so it encourages you to shift your perspective

[04:27] from saying, this is the truth to this is their truth right now.

[04:32] And I need to meet them where they're on,

[04:34] I have to go back across the bridge to where I used to be,

[04:37] talk to them in that language, relate to them,

[04:40] understand their problems and their fears,

[04:44] and then with my, once I've convinced them to trust me enough,

[04:48] then deliver the garlic to them.

[04:50] So you have to give them what they want in order to give them

[04:53] what they need.

[04:54] And this is an essence, what a lot of great marketing in us,

[04:56] especially if you have any type of business

[04:58] that has any sort of transformation that you're delivering.

[05:01] Anything that the other person has to take

[05:02] some steps towards you in order to be successful.

[05:05] And so that stories always stuck with me

[05:07] because it applies to any type of coaching

[05:10] or mentor-mentee relationship,

[05:11] or really anything that you're marketing to the public

[05:14] where you need them to break a belief in order to consume your service

[05:17] or get the result that you need them to have, right?

[05:19] Or that they really need for themselves.

[05:21] And so many times you can't begin with the end,

[05:24] you can begin with the end in mind,

[05:26] you do not begin with the end,

[05:27] you have to start where they're at

[05:29] and then take them along the journey the same one you did

[05:32] so that they can get the where they want to go,

[05:33] which is where you know it's gonna be the best place for them.

[05:36] So anyways, I hope this is valuable for you.

[05:38] If you like that,

[05:39] sure there's buttons and things

[05:40] that you can click and learn more and all that stuff.

[05:43] But anyways, keep being amazing,

[05:44] have an awesome day and I'll catch you soon.

[05:46] Bye.

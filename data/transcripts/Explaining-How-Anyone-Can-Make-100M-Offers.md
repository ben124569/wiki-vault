## Full Transcript
[00:00] Alex has become a mentor to many, a friend to me for sure.

[00:05] And we're going to be unpacking his book, 100 million dollars office.

[00:08] I do not have the hard copy because we are in lockdown right now.

[00:11] And it is lost somewhere, but it is right there.

[00:13] This book is being hugely impactful for me and our community in real ways.

[00:20] There's lots of stuff that you can dig into in the internet marketing world that's like exciting.

[00:25] You know, you watch a keynote from Russell Brunson or any of the grades.

[00:29] And you're like freaking pumped out of your mind.

[00:31] You believe you're one final away.

[00:34] But really, a book I was like, shit, there's like so much good stuff in here.

[00:37] It feels like it's going to work.

[00:40] And then we applied it and loan behold, it worked.

[00:43] But here's where I want to start with your Alex.

[00:45] So, audience, high ticket entrepreneurs, when I talk to coaches and consultants about improving

[00:50] their offer, they typically think like, no, I'm good.

[00:53] Like, client's a getting great results.

[00:55] We just need more calls when you've been a marketing.

[00:57] And so I want to use that by sharing like, what's the difference between an offer and a coaching

[01:02] program?

[01:03] And they came to talk to us about why you always want to start with the offer.

[01:06] I actually wrote the third book in the second book first.

[01:09] And I wrote this book, which is now the first book that came out third.

[01:13] And hopefully you tracked what I just said because I did fairly dead.

[01:17] And the reason I had to do that was with each book, I started with the third book.

[01:21] And I was like, I actually kind of need this second book to make sense, which was lead generation.

[01:24] I was like, well, I finished the second book.

[01:26] And I was like, you know what, if they're offers crap, then that's not going to matter anyway.

[01:28] So I have to start with the offer.

[01:30] And so it kind of went in reverse and it's because like, as I'm thinking through it,

[01:33] I started thinking about the things that I would immediately want to look at in a business.

[01:36] But usually there's these other weaknesses that are much stronger.

[01:40] And from a speed to money standpoint, changing someone's offer is about the easiest thing that you can do in a business intervention.

[01:47] And the offer touches so many components of the business, right?

[01:51] So it touches the lead generation components.

[01:53] So you get more people who are going to respond than who otherwise would have with this period offer.

[01:57] You get more people to buy than who otherwise would have.

[02:00] You get higher pricing and more and more profit as a result of a better offer than you otherwise would.

[02:05] And so with each of those situations, they become all duplicatives in their effects on the business.

[02:10] And when you put them all together, the offer is the lever on all of them.

[02:13] And so I could, you know, for most businesses, you could just turn the entire business around by fixing this one thing.

[02:18] Once that one thing is fixed, then you get into, okay, how many different channels can we have access to?

[02:23] To generate leads?

[02:24] You know, the third book is money models.

[02:26] So how many different ways can we, can we monetize the customer to increase our, you know, our cash conversion cycle?

[02:31] Or basically how quickly we're turned a dollar so we can spend more on the acquisition, which is the third book.

[02:36] The reason to start with the offer is because I think in the marketing community at large.

[02:39] And I say that because just back here, everybody here is in the marketing community at large.

[02:44] This book, I think was a hit.

[02:46] At least I perceive it as a hit because it was the only book that I think is talked about the product.

[02:51] And so I know and talked about product in the marketing community.

[02:53] And so I think it seemed so far in so many people, but if you look in the software world, they only talk about product and they don't care at all about marketing.

[02:59] Because they know and if you will allow me to expand on this for a quick second and then we can, I'll get in the questions.

[03:05] I'm going to, I'll share something with you that's been very, very impactful for me.

[03:09] So a lot of people look at gym lunch and they try and understand the success behind the company and for context for everyone here.

[03:16] The first year I was in business in gym lunch, at least once we switched the licensing model, we took them 17 million dollars in profit for perspective.

[03:25] We paused for a second.

[03:26] It was as fucking insane for me as it might sound to you.

[03:30] So it is not lost on me.

[03:32] And we went from 3 million in profit to your before to 17.

[03:35] And a lot of people who looked at our funnels, they thought Alex, the sales,

[03:40] the engineering community, it's our creative, it's our hooks, it's all, it's all these things and many people try to copy them.

[03:46] But no one was able to duplicate the numbers and the success in the scale.

[03:50] And it was because the product was superior.

[03:52] I mean, I see Marqueux here, I know Marqueux was one of our early clients and he had a gym, I guess, he's doing high ticket, which is awesome.

[03:58] The average client made $30,000 in their first 30 days.

[04:01] That was the average, which means half the people did better than that.

[04:05] And so if you look at the internet market and community at large, I would doubt that there are many offers that produce that kind of result.

[04:12] And so we were able to get 36 to one return or advertising and actually the first year we got 101 return or advertising.

[04:19] Because honestly, the advertising wasn't the thing that was doing the vast majority of the work.

[04:24] It was worth of mouth, it was referrals.

[04:26] And so people might see the ad, but they had heard about it in three or four other places.

[04:30] And I'm told that the book is having a similar effect on people's news feeds and things like that.

[04:35] And for context everyone here, there's no book funnel, there's no obsells.

[04:39] I've spent no dollar or something advertising and it's tells a thousand copies a day right now.

[04:43] With no advertising.

[04:45] I got reached out to people like, hey man, how do you achieve this organic, something with the book?

[04:52] And I was like, you just try to write a really good book.

[04:55] And I think that it's it's often overlooked.

[04:58] And I think that's the piece that I'll finish with and then we'll we can rock in.

[05:02] But if you think about the six acquisition channels that exist for new clients, right, you've got paid media, which is advertising of any kind.

[05:08] You've got owned media, which is your lists of all your people.

[05:11] You've got earned media, which is the platforms that will distribute your stuff organically, like we're on Facebook right now.

[05:16] So this is an organic on it's that's earned media, right?

[05:18] And then you've got the three people based, which is you got manual outbound.

[05:21] You've got affiliates and then you've got referrals and word of mouth.

[05:25] And the six that I just named five of them are linear in nature.

[05:29] What I mean by that is that if I put a hundred dollars in, I get a set or fixed ratio back.

[05:33] So I put a hundred in, I get a thousand out where I do a hundred calls and I get ex appointments, right?

[05:39] It's the same if there's a fixed ratio and then you just increase in scale, right?

[05:42] And with most of those, they're diminishing in nature in terms of the more skill you add, the return ratio diminishes with referrals, word of mouth.

[05:51] It is quadratic, which means it's exponential.

[05:54] And so it is the hardest one to achieve, but once you achieve it, it is the one that will pay you so handsomely that is worth the disproportionate investment of time.

[06:02] And the difference between a good book and a great book is large.

[06:05] Just a good, a great book, an exceptional or remarkable book where a remark worthy as any was so good that you had to tell someone about it is even harder, right?

[06:13] But that extra, the extra amount, the extra income and return yields outside returns in terms of the practical use of that value.

[06:21] And so I think that for us so many people just slap a bunch of videos together and say this is my course, rather than having the in-depth or trench knowledge to go from being good to great or going from great to being exceptional.

[06:34] And I will tell you that having now, which is weird, I feel like an older person in the internet marketing space now, which is hilarious in terms of years in it rather than age.

[06:47] The people who continue to live on and not fizzle and pop are the ones who have superior product because usually the people who do not, wither from the stress or the pressure of unhappy, high-tech, get clients.

[07:02] And so the only way you can weather that emotionally unless you have no conscience is by having a superior product and having intentions of truly always improving the product so that you can weather those stories because you and only you can know your intentions.

[07:14] I think that would be at least my word to this and my test with acquisition.com, which if you read in the book, is kind of the venture that I've been focusing on for the last year.

[07:23] My goal with that business, or really portfolio of businesses, is to grow it exclusively off of inbound because of the other five channels I've grown each of those to multiple figures in terms of how much I've been able to generate from them.

[07:37] But I have never done one off of kind of earned immediate purely inbound. And so that was the goal. And in order to do that, we had to make sure that the product was truly exceptional. And I can tell you that if the people that make much more money than me, it seems to be a constant in that.

[07:50] It is a one-time investment to make a superior product that has compounding returns. Most of the wealth of these people that I know trying to invest in something one time that will pay them forever.

[07:58] Whereas most of the poorest people I know trying consistently have to do things that they have to do over and over and you have to make new campaigns.

[08:05] You have to make new reachouts. You have to make new phone calls. There's a draw things that you have to do in order to keep going and as soon as you stop them, the business ends.

[08:12] But if the product is superior, the product will run on its own.

[08:15] And coincidentally, the profit is extremely great because you have no cost of acquisition.

[08:21] You touched on a couple things there. And obviously, a big focus of what you see this around superior product.

[08:26] But I would say 100% agree, but I would say also people can't distinguish the fact between the reality of the quality of a product.

[08:34] The only option is to make a profit in a way that you can use the product to make a profit in a way that you can use the product in a way that you can use the product in a way that you can use the product in a way that you can use the product in a way that you can use the product in a way that you can use the product in a way that you can use the product in a way that you can use the product in a way that you can use the product in a way that you can use the product in a way that you can use the product in a way that you can use the product in a way that you can use the product in a way that you can use the product in a way that you can use the product in a way that you can use the product in a way that you can use the product in a way that you can use the product in a way that you can use the product in a way that you can use the product in a way that you can use the product in a way that you can use the product in a

[09:04] and so the offer is really communicating across the bridge what it's like to be a client to a prospect and so we're thinking about what are the problems, what are every single problem both known and unknown and little pro tip because if you're at the bookside that pro tip for everybody if you want to include bonuses include one or two bonuses that solve a problem that only occurs upon success.

[09:27] So for example, if I was taking on a company for acquisition.com then a bonus might be I'll also you know introduce you to all my text shelter people all sent you to suit to my

[09:37] Legal team all sent you to my investor people who will help you keep more of the money that we're going to be making.

[09:42] Right, so we're going to solve a problem that's going to assume success and so all of a sudden your prospect is going to have a higher belief in that they're going to achieve it because why what other reason would you be solving problems that that assumes success, right, unless people were being successful.

[09:56] To circle backs what you were saying earlier than the perception right of the product has to be the thing that appears valuable and your ability to do that will also be predicated on the true value of the product so it is it is both ways right.

[10:10] But the idea is and I think this might be contrary to some of the things that are in the internet marketing communities that I believe that you should solve every prospects problem most things operate like a pipeline and so if you have 100 steps if you miss 99 it still won't work it's like a car engine.

[10:24] Like is there a more important part in the car engine than another part?

[10:27] Well, they're all required so they are requisite pieces and I think most times people solve one or two of the things they might bring an engine and they might bring gasoline

[10:37] But they don't have wheels or they don't have spokes or they might not even have the nuts on the wheels, right to keep them on and so it's really thinking through and I think that's where the.

[10:45] The depth of knowledge is so important where like I tell the story and hopefully it'll illustrate the point here.

[10:51] I believe in doing the really ugly unscalable stuff first so that you can have the depth of knowledge to to do this scalable thing a lot of people want to jump the gun and go straight to I mean I can't tell you the amount of times I've talked to quote agency owners or like.

[11:06] Man, these realtors can't make money on my leads and I actually had an agency that I worked with for almost a year on our software platform.

[11:14] And every month I would just say why don't you just get a real state license and actually work your leads.

[11:21] And finally he did it and in his first month he made five times more money than he did in the three years prior because he actually knew what the fuck he was talking about right and so Jim launch became his biggest it was because I spent two years on the road launching.

[11:34] And so we're going to do this.

[11:36] And then we're going to do this.

[11:38] And then we're going to do this.

[11:40] And then we're going to do this.

[11:42] And then we're going to do this.

[11:44] And then we're going to do this.

[11:46] And then we're going to do this.

[11:48] And then we're going to do this.

[11:50] And then we're going to do this.

[11:52] And then we're going to do this.

[11:54] And then we're going to do this.

[11:56] And then we're going to do this.

[11:58] And then we're going to do this.

[12:00] And then we're going to do this.

[12:02] And then we're going to do this.

[12:04] And then we're going to do this.

[12:06] And then we're going to do this.

[12:08] And then we're going to do this.

[12:10] And then we're going to do this.

[12:12] And then we're going to do this.

[12:14] And then we're going to do this.

[12:16] And then we're going to do this.

[12:18] And then we're going to do this.

[12:20] And then we're going to do this.

[12:22] And then we're going to do this.

[12:24] And then we're going to do this.

[12:26] And then we're going to do this.

[12:28] And then we're going to do this.

[12:30] And then we're going to have zero clients or few clients.

[12:32] I think I'll just don't know how this is going to look at 50.

[12:34] And so can you talk about the kind of those spectrums of like easy to sell hard to sell easy to live.

[12:40] To live.

[12:42] So I think that most entrepreneurs would be best served, especially in the beginning.

[12:48] And so it's hard to make broad sweeping statements because there's always exceptions to them.

[12:52] But by and large most entrepreneurs who are probably in this community selling high ticket coaching services would be best served.

[12:58] And then selling a less scalable offer at higher ticket first.

[13:02] And then piece by piece removing pieces that are less scalable.

[13:06] And so you do that because you give higher touch to clients.

[13:08] You have more more profit in your acquisition because most done free models for example.

[13:12] If done properly, I'm not saying agency model is going to not a big benefit of agency models.

[13:16] But most done free models if done properly should yield excess cash.

[13:20] And the issue becomes operational fulfillment, right, which is how I prefer to have my bottleneck.

[13:24] In the operations and scale that in demand generation.

[13:26] That is just my preference.

[13:28] Some people prefer different ways.

[13:30] I prefer it that way.

[13:32] And so that easier something it is to sell in general, which is going to require more hand holding in your part.

[13:36] More services, more things that easier to sell.

[13:38] Right on the flip side if you just sell a course via webinar.

[13:42] It becomes very, very difficult to sell.

[13:44] In general, you have to have very, very high persuasive abilities in order to sell that.

[13:48] And a pretty unique opportunity.

[13:50] Right. If you're selling how to make 100 run Facebook ads, I think that time has somewhat come and going.

[13:52] Right.

[13:54] And so the idea is, I would prefer to be on the easier to sell part of the spectrum.

[13:58] Gain the experience, generate the cash flow and then use the cash for the soft future problems of scale.

[14:04] And I think that that is a better sequence than as a higher likely to success from most people.

[14:08] Yeah. And I would say there's a huge assumption baked into that, which comes down to a really wildly uncommon opinion you have, which is on pricing.

[14:18] Because all of that assumes that you're going to have been excess cash and enough to deliver.

[14:24] And then it's priced right. So can you talk a bit more about pricing because I think for most people.

[14:28] We do what Dan Kennedy calls the Wag pricing model, which is just the wild ask is.

[14:33] Or the industry norm, right? We just go like, what does this person do?

[14:36] What does this person do? Great. I'll be somewhere in the middle of a little bit cheaper.

[14:40] So when we go into that, you know, in our first coaching business, which was obviously Jim launch,

[14:44] we, the highest price person at the time was 5K.

[14:47] The lowest price people were kind of agencies doing 500 bucks a month. So that was kind of the range of the market place.

[14:52] And so when we came in, our front end program was 16K air back end program was actually a three or hundred and twenty six K program.

[14:58] So the pricing was so vastly different than everyone else said it caused prospects to take your pause and say there must be something different going on here.

[15:04] Pause there. And then if you think about what you a lot of people are seeing with the book, at least I'm told, is that the books kind of all over a lot of people's news feeds.

[15:11] Imagine you have this kind of pricing with all of this word of mouth that's surrounding it and then it creates this allure, right?

[15:17] And so the idea is that we have to charge so much in order to get the clients and prospects more invested because,

[15:24] A in a very real way, price confers value, right? So there's a story on the book, but it's it's basically if you had three people try to try three different lines, the high price, the middle price and the low price.

[15:35] And then rate them most people rate it the highest price wine, the best. The thing is is that when they do these studies, they actually make all three lines the same.

[15:42] And so in a very real way, price does can for value your product. That's number one. Number two is that if you change the quality or increase the quality of your prospects, you will increase the quality of your products.

[15:53] So what I mean by that is if I am working with somebody who's making $5 million a year, right? And then I give them a book, right?

[16:02] Dan, all of a sudden that book today is worth $2 million this year, right? If I give that to somebody who's never started a business before, the book might be worth some inspiration.

[16:14] And so there's a very real different in the value that my product delivered based on the quality of my prospect independent of the change in my product.

[16:22] So the second point is that if you change and increase the quality of your prospects, you can also charge your concurrently higher price based on the value that is true that you were delivery to that person.

[16:32] The third piece is that I like having pricing power in general because there is a strong strategic advantage to being higher price. I just need to have them, right?

[16:39] In the marketplace, but one of the biggest ones is that you have so much more gross profits left over that you can spend more in the acquisition, but be you can do things that other people can.

[16:47] And so you further eliminate or separate yourself from the competition by being able to provide things that no one else can, right? So for example, in the gym, which we're all because we had a lot of clients out are we still continue to have a lot of clients that are in the same markets.

[17:00] We were able to spend 50,000 a month every month on testing advertisements and then we would just license those ads out to all of the facilities across, right?

[17:09] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[17:39] no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[47:09] and again, you might think, well, that's add in operational complexity.

[47:12] I think the answer is yes, it is adding operational complexity, but people who make $10 million

[47:16] or more skilled than people who make $30 million.

[47:19] And so that is a skill that you new acquire in the path of getting there.

[47:22] Are there exceptions?

[47:24] Absolutely, but these are kind of, obviously, broad-based for, and I'm talking specifically

[47:28] to high-tech good coaches who are in a niche, usually going from three to 10 months is going

[47:32] to include increasing lifetime value of the customer in some way, either by introducing

[47:36] a back end or keeping them longer.

[47:38] The other piece of it from what you were saying earlier is that if you have to

[47:41] finish that much money on marketing means the products, not that.

[47:43] My question to have you, Alex, because this is a big question.

[47:45] Why did you write the book and what's your new mission if it's not helping Jim's

[47:50] be super profitable?

[47:51] Yeah, so right now, we're just helping businesses that are doing about $5 million in

[47:55] up get to, you know, $30, $50 million a year, because now we've done it four times in

[48:01] the businesses that we own 100% of and so now we're just doing it and participating in it.

[48:06] So we just invest in this company.

[48:07] So we basically function as a makeshift exact team.

[48:10] So we've got a CFO, CIO, which me, VP sales, and so all of those things, basically,

[48:15] folks named because usually at that $5 million level, the issues, you know, I'm an

[48:18] a town, not enough experience.

[48:20] And so we can just go and check those in and the deep bottle back all the things that we

[48:23] know because we've done that so many times.

[48:25] And so in terms of the marketing perspective, I don't really have any desire to sell best

[48:28] for when it's coaches or courses because I don't need to, you know, I mean, the business

[48:31] is that we own already put up that sense of cash flow and I just don't need to do it.

[48:34] So what do I really have the desire and so the idea was, I'll just make basically my goal

[48:38] is to make the best and in a marketing business that exists in everything for it.

[48:41] And then if someone wants to get to that next level, they've already proven themselves

[48:47] able to execute on the concepts that we've able to free, then it means that they're not

[48:50] going to need hand holding for me, which means that I've proven that the information

[48:53] works because they executed on it and they've proven to me that they can do it.

[48:57] And so it's kind of a works off of shared shirts pressed right off the bat.

[49:00] And so that's kind of the goal of the business.

[49:02] The real real is that I think that when I don't think it's going to happen and that there's

[49:05] really no such thing as legacy and if I have 100 generations people who I am, they

[49:09] makes me feel good.

[49:10] I love that I'm like, give you some of the one minute guys.

[49:13] Please share some love to Alex.

[49:16] Alex, thank you so much.

[49:17] He is the man that has nothing to sell you.

[49:19] Plenty of people broke in the world.

[49:21] He doesn't want you to be one of them.

[49:22] So make sure you check him out and dive deep into his stuff.

[49:24] Alex, appreciate your friendship.

[49:26] Appreciate your input.

[49:27] This has been amazing.

[49:28] Have a great day, dude.

[49:29] Appreciate you guys.

[49:30] Thank you for having me.

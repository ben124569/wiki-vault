[00:00] If I were single and starting over, this is how I find my partner.

[00:04] The person who's spent the rest of your life with will have the largest impact on who you become,

[00:08] what you achieve, and how happy you are.

[00:09] But most people spend more time deciding what car they want to buy, or what neighborhood they're going to live in,

[00:15] than the person they're going to marry.

[00:16] When I was in college, there was a graph they put on the board of my economics class that said that there's a 0.71 correlation between your subjective well-being

[00:23] and the strength of your relationship with your significant.

[00:25] And if you pair that with a amount of time spent with friends, family, kids, alone, and spouse, over time, alone and spouse go up and everything else crashes down to like almost nothing.

[00:39] The person that you're going to spend the most amount of time for the rest of your life with is going to be your spouse.

[00:43] The amount of single people that I see right now who are like,

[00:46] I don't want to be on the apps, the apps don't work.

[00:49] It's like, we're talking about finding the one person you're going to be with for the rest of your life.

[00:55] So you're going to spend the most amount of time with that of all humans by like a wide, wide margin.

[01:00] And you're like, I don't want to go on more than 10 dates.

[01:02] It's like, so you just want to spin the wheel 10 times to just pick whatever of the 10 that you get that you're like, I guess this one doesn't suck.

[01:09] And then that's it.

[01:10] That's the rest of your life is like, I just want the rest of my life to kind of not suck.

[01:14] It's kind of like the inverse of selling.

[01:15] Like in sales you have a pipeline and you know what your conversion percentages are.

[01:18] The thing with finding significant other is you only need to find one.

[01:22] And I remember when I was way younger like in high school women in college where you know some girls like, what are you looking for?

[01:28] We're like on a date thing and it did not go the way she was expecting.

[01:31] I was just like these are all the things I'm looking for and she was really discouraged.

[01:35] Looks like you're just trying to find a unicorn.

[01:37] I was like, well, you have to find one.

[01:39] I think I believe in having exceptionally high standards.

[01:41] Only second to the standards you hold yourself to.

[01:43] So either you've got like camp number one, I'll take any one of the pulse.

[01:47] That's one way to do it.

[01:48] You're just going to get the scraps of society which sucks.

[01:50] Camp two which is probably the more prevalent one which is why so many people are struggling is

[01:55] I want to have this amazing person but I suck.

[01:58] But they should be so amazing that they should see me for who I am deep down like deep.

[02:02] No, deeper even deeper like really deep down.

[02:05] They should be able to see that right even though I'm fucked up and I don't have a job and

[02:08] I'm overweight and I'd never stick with my commitments and I never fall through like besides all that.

[02:12] And I lie sometimes.

[02:14] See what I mean that I haven't been faithful for like past relationships but still

[02:17] and I'm not complimentary and like I don't have any values that that they aspire to be

[02:21] and I actually really have nothing going for me.

[02:23] But besides all of that deep deep down, I'm amazing.

[02:26] They just knew how to look.

[02:28] That's like camp two and I feel like that's a lot of people.

[02:30] And then camp three is you know I saw this meme that went like all over the internet which is

[02:35] you can consolidate all of the relationship gurus dating advice to be successful

[02:42] and they were they were making fun of that.

[02:44] Yes.

[02:45] Like that is at the end of everything that's at 100 different hacks and most of them are about

[02:50] deception like realistically like most of the like dating hacks that I see or about

[02:55] posturing and perceiving you know making people see you a certain way.

[02:59] But the thing is is like on a long enough time I was going to figure out who you are.

[03:02] And so like it's short term long term and so people don't want to do the harder long term work

[03:06] of just like being somebody worth being with and want to find out how they can like optimize

[03:11] their dating profiles and don't give me wrong like it's an ad so get nice images.

[03:15] Sure like maybe spend five minutes on what you're going to have every single potential prospect

[03:19] in your life see okay that makes sense.

[03:21] The real work is like okay you go on the date now like right like you still have to like be

[03:26] somebody that somebody might want to be with.

[03:28] So I'm a big like big domino believer which is like if I solve this one big thing can I make

[03:33] all of the rest of these things go away.

[03:35] I can do a hundred tiny tweaks and hacks to try and find a girl who's out of my league or

[03:39] I can just make myself so worthy that I can get any girl no matter what league season.

[03:44] Now if I just do that the rest I don't I don't need to optimize my profile.

[03:47] I don't need to have I don't need to have all these things because if I just have that I'm fine.

[03:51] And so I've just I've tended to try and find that one thing in business, in fitness,

[03:57] in relationships and that serve me pretty well.

[04:00] My dad told me this when I was single he said everyone has a type and you'll date plenty of

[04:05] people who are that type but the chances are that you're not going to marry your type

[04:09] because if you were then you wouldn't have a type you'd have a wife.

[04:12] And I found that really interesting because if you keep dating the same type of person

[04:16] and you're like this is my type then it is probably a good signal that that type of person

[04:20] isn't the person you end up with because you still keep dating them.

[04:23] If you have been dating one type of person then you finally get with somebody else and it's very

[04:27] different it doesn't necessarily mean that's bad if anything it might actually be

[04:32] the type of person you end up marrying and I just find that is a really interesting frame for

[04:36] thinking through mate selection. We date people who fill one clear role or one clear look

[04:43] especially when you're younger it's just I mean at least for me it was just like how hot

[04:47] is this person or whatever but over time you realize that you date someone a little bit on the edge

[04:51] and you're like oh I liked all these other things that people I normally don't have then all

[04:54] of a sudden you start branching into very different types of people and kind of in some ways

[04:59] appreciate it because I would say I've I've dated a more diverse selection of people than I've been

[05:04] I would say friends like anyways friends of me is very nearly interested in certain types of

[05:08] things but people I dated I was willing to date people were far outside of that sphere of competence and so

[05:13] even though I currently now and married to somebody who is in that sphere of like business and

[05:17] hardcore and all that stuff I feel like I I got a big appreciation for lots of different cultures

[05:23] ethnically but also like psychographs of deeply religious people like I dated people who were

[05:28] deeply religious before and so I have a really good appreciation for that and so I wouldn't have

[05:32] had that exposure had I not been willing to kind of break the time I think being able to pick and

[05:36] judge people is one of the most valuable skills you can ever develop and it's one of the hardest

[05:40] ones to build because it takes pattern recognition and getting burned I'm gonna lean into this like

[05:44] judging people is fine you have to assess someone how are you going to assess them without judging them

[05:50] the difference is calling them good or bad like getting an accurate assessment of who someone is or

[05:54] what they do is totally fine in its human to do that and I think it's it's necessary and to this

[05:59] idea of like you should never judge anyone it's like you should judge everyone you just

[06:02] just don't necessarily need to measure your self against them I feel like you're only going to be

[06:06] able to recognize patterns if you put yourself out there and you're willing to have terrible first

[06:11] dates and terrible second dates for an extended period of time because you might find out that there's

[06:16] like a whole set of character traits that you didn't even know were important to you and then you

[06:19] find them and you're like whoa this is now way more important than all the other stuff that I used to

[06:23] think was important I only found that stuff out because like it's really hard to even hear podcasts

[06:27] like this and be like look at what I do this like it is just exposure you can make judgments

[06:31] some people even outside of romance a relationship of like man I'd like this person that I worked with

[06:34] like what are the traits that I like about this person and trying to like really pinpoint those like I

[06:38] I learned that I really liked a woman who respected me and who followed traditional gender roles

[06:45] those are things that are super important to me that I didn't know were important to me I only found

[06:49] that out kind of later I I I needed someone who does not get in the way of my goals if I had somebody who

[06:56] who was felt like I was taking by pursuing my goals I knew it would never work long term because

[07:01] I can't have my entire life be a take for somebody else I'll never be able to to flip that

[07:06] that balance so like I need someone who literally doesn't even see it as a take not somebody's like

[07:10] you can take as much as you want that still doesn't work as a paradigm's wrong like they have to see it

[07:14] as a give like they have to see me working is doing a fulfilling my duty to our household and I want

[07:20] them to judge me on that and so making sure that the person you're with judges you by the metrics

[07:26] that you judge yourself on you might be spending all this time and effort optimizing towards what you

[07:30] think you should be judged on but if they're judging you in completely different metrics you're

[07:35] screwed you'll never win and so there's always going to be this huge disconnect the huge gap

[07:40] where they're like you could be doing when you're like how can I possibly do more but it's

[07:43] because you're actually judging against different outcomes making sure that the things that they

[07:47] expect of you and the things that you expect of you are the same and then they should be supporting

[07:51] you because they want those things from you too and then that way you can work and send

[07:54] your due towards what you're trying to accomplish together rather than feeling there's always

[07:59] this give take because like really really super honestly like Lately I don't really have a give take

[08:03] relationship we both just like want the same thing I never want her to think I could have done

[08:08] or I could have worked harder or I left anything on the field and so I think that's been a source

[08:13] of neutral respect is that we're both harder on ourselves than the other person is on us and so

[08:19] we're always out doing the other person's expectations because we're both assessing on the same

[08:24] metrics. If you want to be the ultimate husband find a woman who loves all the things that you

[08:31] currently do way less work than trying to change everything about who you are to match with they want

[08:37] from you the amount of times I was in relationships where the things that they want to me to do

[08:41] I was like this isn't me like I can't expend effort to do this but I don't want to on a forever

[08:48] basis because I will resign but the thing is that there's another guy who would love to do that

[08:54] and probably does it on his own and they should marry him and so I think just being like really

[08:59] really really brutally honest about what do you really want out of me and what do you expect like

[09:03] was it 10 out of 10 husband look like to you and if it matches what I already do or what I'm

[09:07] planning to do then it makes both of our lives easier because I'm going to work my us off on

[09:11] what I already want to do and it would just so happen to fulfill all of your desires but I think

[09:16] way too many people spend time in this like compromise zone where neither person gets what they want

[09:21] even if both of you compromise you're not enjoying the thing that you're compromising on

[09:26] they're getting a worse version of what they ideally want and you're just walking out this like

[09:31] kind of middle path when I think both people could be better served by being brutally honest

[09:36] upfront and being okay with somebody being an amazing person just not their amazing person you know

[09:41] one of the biggest things that I hate about romance advice and relationship advice in general

[09:45] and the whole space which is why I try not to touch it is that there is no objective measure

[09:49] for a relationship billionaire so like somebody else could be married or in a relationship and I make

[09:55] a piece of content and they're like well you're a fucking wrong because of x, y and z and I'm like

[09:59] things is that there's no way that anyone externally can see how healthy a relationship is

[10:06] and so that's what I think makes it so hard about the space because the only success metric we have is

[10:10] not divorced the vast majority marriages that I see I would not want at all worry southernland said this

[10:16] which I think is actually interesting he talked about how realtors realtor should be advertising the

[10:19] negative aspects of property to allow people to make better decisions if you say hey it's you know

[10:24] I'm next to the pub area for some people that's gonna be a no-go zone but for somebody who likes

[10:31] the nightlife then it's gonna be a pro but all realtors do is talk about the plus sides but what

[10:36] you really want is the arbitrage between something that you are fine with that would quote devali

[10:40] property that someone else isn't fine with and that's where the the mismatches or the better

[10:46] matches actually happen I think to the same degree people could approach dating that way which is

[10:50] rather than say all the good things like I'm hardworking I'm in shape whatever state all the downsides

[10:55] because if all of your downsides someone's like those things don't bother me that becomes a

[11:00] very strong relationship or has the making is a strong relationship because then there's all the

[11:05] things that everyone is complaining about of you if they're cool with it then they only get upside

[11:10] if I'm fine with being on the bars when it's late next to the metro even though there's noise

[11:16] because I work from an office and I don't I'm not home during the day if I must you know I'm a guy

[11:21] and I'm not worried about being in a rougher neighborhood because I was gonna you know necessarily approach

[11:24] me versus a not a single girl who's a hundred pounds then that's probably that house my match with

[11:30] that house is probably a good deal for me I'm probably gonna get I'm gonna probably get a steel in the house

[11:34] and so you want to get a steel on a partner is like all these things is what other people

[11:38] were bothered about fuck I love all that shit I'm fine with all of it like you worked too much

[11:44] cool me to all what worked together people kind of like that I'm like kind of particular about

[11:48] what I eat and like I want to you know stay in shape cool me to awesome and so just take all the

[11:53] negatives and find somebody who thinks as negative as your positives or at least neutral and then like

[11:57] how much effort you put in the relationship you're just being you and they just like you for you and I think

[12:01] that's way more about like what is liking someone from who they are it's that and it's not like

[12:07] I don't think it's this whole journey of like they suck at these things but I accept them it's more like

[12:12] everyone else thinks this suck about them but I'm cool with it I think that's a much stronger friend

[12:16] the person who's opinion matters the most of me is hers like her her is carries the most weight

[12:22] so if she's like you crush that it means a lot more to me than 500 thousand strangers saying

[12:27] I crush that because if she said it then like she knows what I'm capable of whereas for many people who

[12:33] don't know you anything that's better than what they would do they would consider a success but

[12:37] they're barbers much lower than mine and so she knows what my barbers and she has a high bar too and

[12:42] so that's why it matters more like the reason that she's probably not writing a book anytime is because

[12:46] she knows how much work I put into it and she's like I'm afraid it's not gonna piss because when

[12:49] he hears on the flip side she's so much better at running a company she's so much better at

[12:53] leading she's so much better at managing she's so much better interacting with people selling ideas to the team

[12:57] I'm great at selling ideas to the public she's great at selling ideas to the team and so completely different skills

[13:01] up and so I am and like when she just creates stuff with the team like I just I just appreciate her on all

[13:05] stuff that she does I would say that for me appreciation believe it or not actually comes

[13:09] really easily in romantic relationships like she's charmed with praise like I I've always been good at that

[13:15] do other stuff like gifts fuck you know like access service tougher for me but like telling you

[13:21] did a good job I'm your guy even within the people that we date we should still have priorities of like

[13:27] what is the most important what's second most important and if you're like well they're all

[13:30] important then it means that you need to clarify your priorities because nothing everything can't be

[13:34] priority this is literally strategy in business everything's important but some things are still more

[13:38] important than others and if you can't get clear what the priorities are for you then how the

[13:42] fuck do you expect your spouse or your partner or the person you're dating to figure out what's

[13:45] important for you if you can't even figure it out and so if you're clear on here's my checklist of

[13:49] tactics that mean a lot to me and then here's my checklist on goals or character traits or activities

[13:54] that mean a lot to me if they if they sacrifice a number three to keep doing number one you can't be

[14:00] upset about that because that was the tree that you decided to make now if they show you some

[14:04] three awesome it's gravy but the number one still has to stay number one for her me having big goals

[14:10] and being ambitious it was the number one thing that she was attracted to and I was like good

[14:13] because that's the thing that's not going to change now these other things if I have time or I've

[14:18] had space or I remember I do them but I also forget all the time I forgot her birthday the first

[14:23] year we were married I also forgot mine I can't believe you would do that to your wife I was like

[14:27] I also did it to me I like me too so like what does that say it's making sure you understand the

[14:31] trade-ups are making and then not being upset after the fact at the price tag for the Nike's that you chose

[14:36] to buy it costs 500 bucks either get the Nike's or don't complain about the price you can't

[14:40] have both I think really clearly stating you want this the cost of this is this are you okay with

[14:49] that if you're not this won't work because I too want this but I understand the cost is this and

[14:55] I'm willing to pay the cost but are you willing to pay it too and I think if that person is not

[15:00] willing to pay it then they're not supporting your long term goals and then if you play it out

[15:04] and you don't achieve your long term goals who do you blame you'll resent them and if you're an

[15:10] amazing stoic you blame yourself but realistically you probably just resent so I had I've a friend who

[15:15] was been single for a long time he was dating somebody for you know a few years he was like how do you

[15:19] just stick with one person he's obviously successful guy and shape whatever like a chat right

[15:24] who couldn't who can get girls you know we'd gone back and forth and I just tried to

[15:27] consolidate it into one statement I added the other two on later what I told him is I was like you

[15:32] just trade novelty for loyalty like you you give up novelty but what do you get if you give up

[15:37] novelty but then you don't have loyalty yeah it's a bad fucking trade but if you get loyalty for me

[15:42] I value loyalty arguably even above love loyalty as we have defined it is your ability to predict

[15:48] behavior like if someone is loyal it means that I have a high ability to predict their future behavior

[15:53] if someone is disloyal then they I might not know what they're doing and that's not a controlling thing

[15:58] it's just like disassembties somebody backed in accordance to the statements that they've made

[16:02] if you trade exploration for trust or like you can explore all of these things but then you don't

[16:06] really trust anyone but if you stop exploring then you start paying you start investing in time

[16:13] into one thing and I think the dividends of that time is trust and then you trade like this is

[16:17] from a day to day activities perspective you trade the chase of chasing tail chasing women chasing

[16:23] men whatever for journey together so one is you kind of on the hunt and the others with you

[16:28] someone by your side going towards someplace so rather than you going towards people you're with someone

[16:32] already going towards an idea where goal or an outcome or purpose and so for me those were

[16:37] trades that I was willing to make basically the moment I thought I wouldn't be able to marry someone

[16:41] I stopped seeing them I had multigriles big like I'd be weird but like be like let's get married let's do

[16:45] this and I was like I don't think I want to and then that was it but it saved me a lot of time and

[16:50] saved them a lot of years and so I also think it's an ethical thing and this is this is more message

[16:54] to guys and really just message to the chads out there so taking for what it is but like I genuinely

[17:01] do not like when a guy pretends like he might do something later when he knows that he's not going

[17:06] to want to have kids or he's not going to want to get married and the girl is there waiting hoping

[17:12] and I like that because to me it's a lie I state the facts until the truth is probably like one of my

[17:16] big comeback to is and everything in life especially hardships it's like if you have our conversation

[17:21] state the facts until the truth like I don't want to marry you if you would like to hang out with me

[17:25] in the meantime while you find someone on my with that but I want to be clear that this is my intention

[17:31] if it evolves into something later because you magically change maybe it would probably not and I

[17:35] think that people can't have the hard conversation because their powers that being said if you

[17:38] prefer novelty to loyalty and you prefer exploration to trust and you prefer the chase to a journey

[17:46] then you shouldn't get married like I have no I have no qualm one way the other that was just a

[17:52] trade I was wondering with this particular person it'd be hard for me to find another Laila your

[17:57] spouse married two people the person you are and the person that you want to become make sure that they

[18:04] love both sometimes they meet you in today but where you're going is somewhere very different tomorrow

[18:10] and so it comes back to the idea of change versus growth which is if they want you to grow

[18:15] then it's being more of what you already are in the direction you're already growing if they want

[18:19] you to change they want you to be someone different towards a different end goal and so I think a lot of

[18:24] people kid themselves this happens I think more women towards men than men towards women to be honest

[18:29] but like women will try and like he's a project it's like that's a fucking terrible way to live life

[18:34] like dear god making the person that you are committed to a project it means that they don't

[18:39] either love who you are they don't love who you're going to become most people have been in only like

[18:42] three or four major relationships in their life before they get married and a lot of times it's just like

[18:47] the person who was there at the time when they were old enough that they should get married like that's really

[18:52] what happens most of the time which is why most marriages are non-spectacular but I think if you

[18:57] went on a hundred dates you probably have a way better idea of the types of people the characters

[19:02] out there the interest that you might be able to potentially share with someone and just not

[19:06] basically just not settling just being willing to say no to good and good not being good enough

[19:12] most people have an idea of their aspirations and their goals if those are your aspirations in your

[19:16] roles hopefully you share them with your spouse or the person that you want to be married to and if

[19:20] that person is aligned with those aspirations and goals then they should be aligned with you

[19:24] paying the price to achieve them it just comes down to that like if they if they're willing if they

[19:28] love the person you want to become then they're going to be willing to do with the sacrifice that

[19:33] it will take to get where it becomes an issue I think is where people don't know what they want to

[19:36] to do with their lives and to me that's a you problem that you need to solve because otherwise you're just

[19:39] basically a role dice and the other person's a role dice and then you role them later on your

[19:43] relationship and you find out that you want to have a thing which I think honestly counter to popular

[19:47] opinion I think that's a perfectly fine reason not be with somebody and for some reason you're it's

[19:51] okay to break up with somebody when you're not married because you want different things but then

[19:54] if you find out later that you want different things in your marriage it's not okay if Leyla came to

[19:57] me to Marron was like I want to live in a farm and not work and do whatever I'd be like that's

[20:01] going to be tough I'd try and convince her otherwise but like I would be tough because they would just

[20:06] it it was like that's a price I'm not going to pay because what I'd be sacrificing is my dream

[20:10] to let one be because at the end of the day like your spouse can either be a liability or an asset

[20:14] and they remind her is that liability is decline in value over time assets increase in value

[20:18] I recommend choosing a ladder that is why growth is so important to me from a picking a spouse

[20:23] perspective because women's status declines in time they're most attractive that you know 20 to 30 years old

[20:30] than then it declines in time if you use society standards they have to have other ways of providing

[20:34] value I would rather be with somebody who's continually getting better continually working on

[20:37] themselves continuing trying to get new skills getting your perspectives new experiences whatever

[20:42] and somebody who's going to stagnate and just basically ride the hotels of their genetic lottery

[20:47] which unfortunately if you a lot of like entrepreneur you know well the guys that I know like

[20:50] they just pick somebody who wanted genetic lottery they're just instead of being a trust fund kid it's a

[20:55] it's a it's a beauty trust fund girl they just were born beautiful they have nothing else because

[20:59] they never needed to and that sucks so there's a stat that always gets thrown around that the more

[21:04] than half of marriages end in divorce but it's a little bit misleading because it's actually significantly

[21:09] lower for first time marriages so first time marriages have like a 30% chance of divorce third

[21:14] fourth et cetera I think second is like 70 and third is like 80 or something it's very high very very high

[21:21] so so the reality is that the people who get married many times skew the stats because the divorce

[21:26] rate is based on marriages not based on people but yeah so there is this illusion they're like you

[21:30] know all marriages end but like if it's your first marriage you've got a seven and a ten

[21:33] shot of staying married till when you die I feel like that's a little bit more encouraging yeah I mean

[21:37] I see I like I like the I like the term partner even though it's like considered like woke or something

[21:42] now I think but I like the term partner or life partner because of what it like really entails more

[21:46] than spouse or wife or husband because what you're really signing up for is somebody who's going

[21:52] to partner with you for life and so like if you had a business partner you'd want somebody had

[21:55] you know contrasting skills with you but had the same goal or like via a partner that you

[22:00] want to build this amazing thing together they should want to go the same places you they should

[22:04] want to have the same values as you's getting there if they should have complimentary skills that's

[22:07] what picking a good partner looks like in business and it looks the same in marriage if you find

[22:12] a true partner then the sum of the whole is greater than its parts I'd say the vast majority

[22:18] relationships one or the other is a liability and is a is a weight against the other person and the

[22:23] person who's in the relationship would be better off if they were alone and so that's kind of how

[22:28] I measure that's how I would measure relational success is how how much more valuable is the sum

[22:35] than the individual parts and so I think the people who get the biggest delta between who they are

[22:39] individually versus who they are together that's what I would deem is the measure of a successful

[22:44] relationship how much better are they together I love this is analogy from Gary V cheerleaders don't

[22:49] ask the quarterback to leave the game when the games on the line a good spouse clears the way on the

[22:54] field or cheers from the sidelines to support you but you know what they never do ask you to leave the game

[22:59] when the games on the line and the thing is I see so many so many spouses who win the games on the line

[23:05] and the person's been putting all this time in to achieve the goal that they said matter to them

[23:10] then says I also have this other goal that matters to me too I'm changing the rules on you

[23:15] and I think that creates a lot of conflict it's like I'm trying to win the way that I thought

[23:19] we both said we wanted to win but now you're saying that halfway through the game or when I'm at the

[23:22] tenure line that touched on some matter anymore that for me if someone did that and meant it

[23:28] I would run the other way because you can't win honestly most relationships are

[23:33] one person's watching from home with the game in the background all they're doing and stuff

[23:37] blowing up the person's phone while they're on the sidelines before like an important point

[23:40] that they need to win saying all these things that aren't going to help them or even actively

[23:45] hope that they their spouse's team loses so they can finally come home because they change the rules

[23:49] and said this is actually winning now but then when they're home they say why aren't you winning

[23:53] on the field and if you're with somebody who can't get straight what they want from you find someone who

[23:57] does I had a I had a relationship that I was super into for a very long time but at the end of the day

[24:02] they wanted different things out of life they were like these are the goals that I have and I was like

[24:06] these are the goals I have and like we amacably split and I was like I hope you get all that stuff

[24:11] I'm not the guy for that but I hope you get it because if that's not a line then like we're just

[24:15] going to run into conflict later because one of us is going to have to give if there's two separate

[24:19] goals one person's goal is going to have to give or you have the same goal and then you both give

[24:24] all you have to that one goal and so rather than being detractors the efforts become additive

[24:28] and then they stack on top each other which is why the whole value in relationship or the

[24:32] strength of relationship is based on how much better they are together versus a part.

[24:35] At the end of the day I think we all need someone who believes in us as much or more than we believe in

[24:39] ourselves bonus points if they're your spouse and double bonus points if you're that person for them.

[24:44] If the whole point is to get the sum of the whole to be greater than the parts they have to

[24:47] believe that you can be better than you are and it's about being better not different than who you are

[24:51] and I think that's a big delineation that gets confused like they define you being more the way I

[24:56] want you to be as better but it's really just different than who you are but if it's I want you to be

[25:00] more of who you are than that's better and if that better is also there better that's when I think

[25:05] the magic happens and if you can also do that for them then I think you have a really virtuous

[25:10] cycle of both people reinforcing one another to become better versions of themselves aligned with

[25:14] the goal that both of you already pre-agree to say that you wanted. I think everyone should have

[25:18] obscenely high standards for the one person that you're spending the rest of their life with

[25:21] but you can only have those obscenely high standards if you hold yourself to a higher standard

[25:25] than you hold them to. Big goals plus big work equals ambitious. Big goals plus lazy equals entitled

[25:34] and I think most people feel entitled to an amazing spouse but they aren't ambitious about how they

[25:40] want to pursue them and so I think if we replaced a lot of this basically being mediocre and

[25:46] complaining about the mediocre selection you have with how do I hold myself to a higher bar than I

[25:50] hold my spouse to my future spouse to. I think you'll find that future spouse but it's probably

[25:56] three or four iterations from who you currently are to deserve or be worthy of that spouse.

[26:02] I think Layla had someone asked her, no I don't know where to go and they're like how would I

[26:06] be able to get a girl like you? She gave me afterwards and she was like I didn't want to say the

[26:10] mean thing which is like I would never be with someone like you. Like that's the real. I think most

[26:14] of better marriages comes from becoming better people, better people than are attracted to

[26:21] better people which then means that you have the very hard work of looking yourself in the mirror

[26:26] and saying like where am I deficient and if it's everywhere you start with the most important one

[26:31] and you start there. I'm much wealthier now that my wife is in my life I'm in much better shape

[26:36] then when I'm at Layla I'm much less angry than when I'm at Layla I'm more patient than when

[26:44] I'm at Layla I'm kinder than when I'm at Layla I'm far more in hurts and far more long suffering

[26:51] and I experience a lot more joy in my life than when I'm at her. There's no almost no

[26:57] stat that I have that has gone down. If you find someone that is taking you away from more than one of

[27:02] your goals especially if they're priorities for you I think you're far less likely to change them

[27:06] and it'll be far easier to find someone who is.

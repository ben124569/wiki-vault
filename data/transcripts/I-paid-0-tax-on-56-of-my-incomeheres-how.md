[00:00] It's not how much you make, it's how much you keep and inside of this video I'm going to share with you in a single presentation

[00:05] Everything that I've ever learned in paying over 30 million dollars in taxes in the last five years, which was miserable

[00:10] And probably paying 500,000,000 million dollars in tax preparation stuff. So tax products, experts, accountants, audits, all of that stuff

[00:18] All the fancy things that the rich people don't want you to know. I'm sharing it all with you here in this video

[00:23] It's a presentation. It's a little different than I normally have. So let me know if you guys kind of like the longer form

[00:27] I know some of you guys said you did and so if you're new to the channel, my name is Alex Mosey

[00:30] Welcome to Mosey Nation and enjoy after paying 22.68 million dollars in taxes in the past five years

[00:35] Here's everything that I've learned about saving taxes in one presentation and if you don't know who I am I'm going to

[00:39] Approved you that this is an over-zeer legit in a second but let's get forward and at the end of this I'll give you my six

[00:44] Consolidated takeaways that you can immediately use to save yourself to access make one money all that kind of good stuff and a bonus

[00:50] Set up beliefs that have served me well up to this point in my life and we just recently sold a

[00:54] 60 six months taken two of those companies at a 46.2 million dollar valuation which you can look up on the

[00:58] Internets yourself if you are skeptical which would be totally realistic and reasonable of you

[01:03] Considering the many tubers and interwebers that exist that are probably saying things that are a little bit stretched from the truth

[01:11] All right, so let's dive in so quick confession

[01:14] I used to be assessed with tax savings

[01:16] So it was literally like took up a very large percentage of my time

[01:18] I spent roughly $1.6 million in legal and accounting fees to figure out the structure that I have today

[01:23] And so this will be a culmination of all my applied knowledge and beliefs related to taxes to date as a US citizen

[01:29] In a single presentation and hopefully save you five years of learning all the money that I have spent so enjoy it

[01:35] My gift to you all right

[01:36] So here's the four beliefs about taxes that have improved my life and probably made me a lot of money up to this point

[01:41] So number one is that tax shelters cost more than they save you might be like how is that even possible

[01:46] Great question. I will dive into it number two tax shelters decrease your network. How is that even possible as well

[01:51] Baldur dash Alex I know it's crazy number three tax shelters diminish your life

[01:57] How can it diminish my life? I will prove it to you in just a moment number four tax shelters

[02:02] Don't make you better person you're like well that one I believe okay fair enough

[02:05] Well, I'll show you each one of these and more so the problem with number one

[02:10] Which is tax shelters call for when they save is that what tax shelters save you?

[02:14] They cost you more in other resources

[02:17] So what they save you in money they cost you more and other things

[02:20] All right, so there's three primary costs that people do not account for and that I myself did not account for what I started this journey

[02:25] So long ago in the business world

[02:28] So number one is the cost of discovery and conversion number two is the cost of upkeep and number three is the cost of unwinding

[02:35] And if you're like I don't know any of those things mean let me explain all right

[02:38] So number one the cost of discovery is that 90 I'm gonna borrow this from Charlie Monger

[02:43] So 95% of solutions are swamplanned in five percent of legit and so as he is my hero in many ways not just in investing

[02:50] I turned to him first to try and figure out what the best kind of course of action around tax was the short and simple answer is

[02:56] Pay them and the reason for that is his quote here is that

[03:00] 19 out of 20 of these things are not legit and are actually gonna get you into trouble and so the problem is the cost of

[03:06] Discover is the is the the cost of the time and the attention that it takes you to sift through all the crap to figure out the one out of 20 that is

[03:14] Actually worth it right and let's just just assume somehow you're like you know what you did all of that work

[03:19] You got on calls with the contents and lawyers and your legal operating structure with every one of these things

[03:25] And you ran through all the tests that I'm gonna show you later in this slide deck of the things that you should look for in these types of structures and it

[03:30] Let's assume you did all that stuff

[03:32] Then it you have this huge cost of conversion right it takes a lot of time to fit these things create new entities

[03:37] Transfer all your stuff over re-incorporate recreate your new contracts for all of your clients

[03:42] It's set around new banking relationships and all of that stuff

[03:45] So there's a cost of figuring out which of these is actually legit which 95% of them are not number two is if you actually

[03:52] Happened to find something that might be legit right not even including the cost on the 19 that didn't actually, you know

[03:57] We're not actually legit then you have the cost to converting them, but that's just cost number one

[04:01] Cost number two is that okay now you've converted your thing

[04:04] You have the cost of upkeep all right, so what you have to do now is you have to trade valuable attention for less valuable money by percentage

[04:10] All right, so I'll give you a couple stories to drive this point home. So very close friend of mine

[04:15] Traveled a hundred and four days a year back and forth between Puerto Rico and the United States

[04:20] So basically every week and he'd fly back home and then you know on Monday

[04:24] He'd fly back out and he did this every single day because he didn't want to pay US taxes, right?

[04:29] But guess what he was traveling a hundred and four days a year and we're on the phone and I was like hey, man

[04:33] Do you think it'd be possible that you could make 30% more money if you didn't travel a hundred and four days a year?

[04:41] It was like I didn't really think about it like that. I was like yeah, but you should and the thing is

[04:44] So we're trading this very valuable time and attention for less valuable money by percentage all right

[04:49] Number two is I have a different friend who counts his days in New York City to go back and forth

[04:56] And it's like guys like can we can we not figure out a way to just make more money within the current vehicle a different

[05:02] front of mine actually missed their babies birth

[05:06] Because they had to get their days in right like what are we trading here and then finally

[05:12] On a more tactical level a close relative of mine

[05:16] It was like hey, I think you should do this captive insurance thing with me and I said okay, let's look into it

[05:21] So we looked into it together and I already looked at captive a couple of times

[05:24] Because you know there were some tax savings by the way. They're very marginal in my opinion and definitely not the

[05:30] Be cost of upkeep and so every month every quarter

[05:33] You have to allocate a certain percentage of funds and decide how much of those funds

[05:36] You need to allocate into the insurance vehicle so that you can stay legit in terms of are we really using this for

[05:42] Insurance are we can actually take claims out of it and then what is reasonable amount that we can put in here

[05:46] And you're constantly allocating attention to this thing that does not provide value to the business

[05:50] Number two, and this is what I did not know when I was getting into this game is that one

[05:53] There was the cost of discovery and cost of conversion to you've got the cost of upkeep and three

[05:57] And here's the real one that no one tells you about especially the people who are trying to sell you these tax shelters

[06:01] Is the cost of unwinding and fines all right?

[06:04] And so not only do they cost more than they save up front?

[06:07] They often don't even end up saving you anything in the long run and here's why

[06:11] Most of the big tips and tricks get unwound in a matter of years and the reason for that is because the IRS is three to five years behind

[06:17] And so when they see a loophole they close it right, but it closed it three to five years later

[06:22] Because they're so understand and all that kind of stuff right and so often people will get find because they

[06:29] They're evading taxes right and so they'll say you were not using this clause for the manner in which it was intended

[06:36] So now you always taxes on three years ago plus fines plus interest and so then you not only have the fines in the interest

[06:45] But then you have to spend the cost of the legal and the accounting and all the other stuff to unwind the structure that you did

[06:51] Under the wrong guys because you pretended to use the structure in this way as it was intended

[06:56] But you didn't actually do it in the way as intended because you did it to save taxes which is not the point of the clause

[07:01] And I have had this happen to people I know very close to me

[07:05] Right and the thing is is like everyone has to understand this

[07:08] They write the rules and so matters most is what your intention is when you'd use these structures that are complex

[07:16] Like the tax code is an incentive system you have to think about it like that

[07:20] They are putting penalties and incentives so that they can move the economy in the way that they believe is right

[07:26] So the reason real estate has a lot of tax incentives is because they believe that they want people to reinvest in infrastructure in the company

[07:33] They want people to develop land. They want people to keep buildings from falling apart

[07:36] And so they give lots of incentives to people to go invest in those things if all of the tax incentives in real estate disappear

[07:43] Real estate would not be nearly as attractive and a lot of buildings were founded as right because it would be worth it to people

[07:47] So then the country by extension will vote to disrupt right and so the idea here is that we have to read the tax

[07:52] Who as an incentive plan and that's just side to number one

[07:56] But

[07:57] Point is is that with these things they cost more to discover cost more to convert cost more to upkeep and

[08:03] Most of the times will not actually end up saving you money in long run, which is why

[08:07] Tax shelters cost more than they save. Okay, so that was number one

[08:12] Hopefully we check that box off number two

[08:15] Tax owners do not increase your network and you're like how is that even possible? I thought the whole point of this is that they're gonna increase your network

[08:19] I will show you why so what they save they cost you more than the resources and drive this one in all right

[08:25] So there's three pieces here one is the people to is the thingy process in three is how fortunate

[08:29] You're actually built and number sheet. You're gonna want to pay attention to because something that I did not understand

[08:33] Into a way to later my lunchroom and career. So let's dive in all right

[08:37] So the people so look at the richest people in the world a lot of them live in the United States

[08:41] And not only that a lot of them live in California, New York, which is wild

[08:44] Right, how is it the rich people in the world can live in the highest tax tax

[08:48] Places in arguably the world. How is that even possible?

[08:52] Maybe they know something that we don't which is that they're using they know how to build fortunes struggle to end point C

[08:58] But the thing is is that if that were the case then simply going to a tax friendly area

[09:04] It's not in and of itself going to increase your no worth all right

[09:06] Which is I think is important and as an important side note is that when you also surround yourself with people in those types of environments

[09:13] Especially when people move to very specific geographics only and solely for the purpose of tax sheltering

[09:19] Right, in my opinion what happens is they start thinking increments rather than in orders of magnitude

[09:25] So let me explain so it's majoring in the miners. It's thinking how can I save 30%

[09:31] Chunks rather than make 30 times more money

[09:34] Right, and you talk to those people are gonna make the argument like, wow, no, I'm gonna do both

[09:38] It's like no, you're not because you're you're literally sacrificing everything that you have to just save 30% when and I'll get to the big picture stuff in a minute

[09:45] But the big wins are would drive your net worth right

[09:49] So you can spend all this time and attention obsessing about stuff

[09:52] Right, these little do-das to save 2% 1% whatever that might end up getting unwanted later and because it's probably swampline is probably not legit anyways

[09:59] Or you could just bought Bitcoin in 2014 and been done with it the point is that the big wins the very few big wins are the things that are gonna drive the net worth the most

[10:08] Not the tax shelters and so people disproportionately

[10:11] Allocate their attention towards these savings when that is not where the disproportion amount of the net worth is going to come from

[10:17] So don't surround yourself people who are obsessed with this stuff because they're thinking in increments

[10:21] Not in orders of magnitude. They're not thinking how can I ten X they're thinking how can I save 10% and that in my opinion is a wrong way to go about

[10:27] But in fortune which if you're watching this channel and your part of imagination that is the point

[10:32] All right, so see how fortunes are actually meter this one is one that I hope that you like slow down and I will try to talk a little bit more slowly

[10:39] Then this because I really want everyone to get this one. Okay, so how forward to direction 8 you make and I grab this from Jack

[10:45] But your F thing on Twitter, but this is a loose alusa

[10:49] Paraparasing but you make fortunes by taking a lot of risk with a little bit of money

[10:53] You maintain fortunes by taking small amounts of risk with a lot of money. All right, so just understanding how fortunes are actually made

[10:59] All right now let's dive into some some math in a second

[11:02] So wealth comes from the appreciation of equities not income all right

[11:07] So how is it that all these very wealthy people living these high-tex places?

[11:10] It's because 94% of the fortune 100 growth came from appreciation not income in other words

[11:17] What we build builds our net worth not what we make

[11:23] Huh

[11:25] Interesting let's dive a little further into this all right

[11:28] So let's let's let's put an example like you're in your four of your business and so let's say last year your business made

[11:35] $10 million in EBITDA all right, which is profit fancy word for profit sort of all right now and you can move the zeros

[11:41] You can make it a million you made a hundred thousand doesn't really matter. All right, you make a hundred million

[11:45] The point is let's just say in this case last year business paid ten million dollars and EBITDA profit all right

[11:50] And let's say you it's valued at five x which would be a fifty million dollar business. Okay, and you receive

[11:58] 10 million times point six three

[12:00] Which would be 37% is taking out for taxes so you get

[12:03] 66.3 million dollars and after tax dividends and let's assume that you're not reinvesting any of it in the business

[12:08] And you're taking your all as dividends just for the sake of this simple example. Okay

[12:12] Now you're like okay, I guess that makes sense now pause and hold that so you made six point three million and your business is worth fifty got it

[12:19] Now next year let's see you go from ten million to twelve million in EBITDA

[12:22] Awesome good for you little 20% growth very conservative sounds good still

[12:27] Value to five x and the value wait a second goes from fifty million to sixty million

[12:31] Huh, but wait there's more you receive 12 million times point six three which is seven point six

[12:37] Million dollars after tax and dividends and so if you look at your net worth increase the net worth increase is

[12:44] ten million dollars plus

[12:47] 7.6 million so you had a net worth increase of

[12:51] 17.6 million so let me break this down for you all right, which is

[12:54] 60 million the new value of the business minus

[12:58] 50 million right is the 10 and

[13:01] Then 12 million times the 37% tax rate gets you 7.6 you add the 10 plus 7.6 to 17.6 million

[13:08] But here's where it's interesting if you're net tax

[13:11] So you made 22 million dollars in increase net worth and your after tax was 17.6 million

[13:17] Then you were effectively taxed at 21%

[13:20] Huh and why is that it is because

[13:23] 56% of your net worth increase was tax-free

[13:27] It was based on the appreciation of the equities of the things that you own

[13:31] Rather than the income that you make which is why what you build builds your net worth more than what you make

[13:36] All right, so this one I really want to drive this home

[13:38] If you can make the business that you have more valuable the income that you derive from the business is not the primary value that you are actually build it

[13:45] Right if you double the profit of the business and you have a five x multiple

[13:49] Right you work you have a double multiplier that is happening on something that you own in a very real way

[13:56] Compared to what you're actually taking out of the business and so in a lot of ways like

[13:59] Give yourself the salary live on the salary that you have from the business, but let the value of the business compound

[14:05] And it doesn't even matter if you're living in the high-stacks state ever because here's what's even crazier

[14:09] This is value debt 5x right if you look at publicly traded companies like some of the S&P right now straight at 40 which is absolute insanity

[14:16] I'm never going to get into that but that means that if I were to increase my e-bata in this example by two million dollars

[14:23] There's a 40 x multiplier which means I increased my net worth by 80 million dollars

[14:30] So that is why these guys can manufacture these fortunes because there's massive multiplier on equities

[14:36] Right, so it's not the income that you make that's the thing that's building your net worth and so letting that be the primary driver of why you make your decisions

[14:43] Where you live when how you feel about where you live is going to create farm or wealth

[14:48] Then the savings well right it's orders of magnitude not incremental thinking all right

[14:52] Which is why taxis soldiers do not increase your net worth as much as people will make it seem all right

[14:57] So number three is that taxis does not improve your life all right

[15:01] So a little shift here is that I call this inverted priorities so saving the tax when it will hurt other aspects of your life

[15:06] Let me explain so

[15:09] One follow this line of reasoning

[15:11] I want to increase my net worth so that I can

[15:14] Live where I want to live with the people that I care about so in order to do that

[15:18] I'm going to not live where I want to live or spend time with the people that I care about to have more net worth

[15:26] So that I can wait a second

[15:28] Some of it doesn't make sense here and that is correct

[15:30] It does not make sense because what we're doing is we're putting the means of achieving the goal above the goal itself

[15:36] Right and this happens all the time because us as entrepreneurs we create this this reinforcing cycle

[15:41] Of conditional behavior we get this intermittent resource which is how you create addiction right of the work that we do and we forget

[15:47] Why we started doing the work which is we have this goal and don't don't we run?

[15:50] I think that work is the goal right but at the end of the day if if we claim that we want to

[15:58] Increase our net worth so that we can have this level of freedom et cetera

[16:01] Then we can't make the means which is money be more important than the thing

[16:06] So for sacrificing the goal in order to get more means it doesn't make sense

[16:10] Which brings me to number two is why sacrifice a resource that I care about and that I can get no more of for one that I need no more of and

[16:18] Can generate it will and as a side note has decreasing marginally utility which means that the more of it

[16:24] You have the less valuable it is which is not the same with time but anyways, so number three

[16:30] We can say and this is actually a text exchange that I had a different front of mine

[16:36] Who you know, it's like listen, you know, we can be on Instagram. We can be on on YouTube and we can say money doesn't matter and blah blah blah

[16:43] But it's a very different thing to say that money doesn't matter or we can live that money doesn't matter

[16:48] Which means it's like if you can be making these posts and making these claims about how you know

[16:53] You really moved on from this and you've got this bigger picture about life and perspective

[16:57] It's like but all you're doing is sacrificing your life

[17:00] So that you can save little points here and little points there. It's like it's fake. It's not true

[17:05] Like you don't actually believe that right?

[17:07] It's all I think there's one thing to be talk to talk to path and another thing to walk the path and so if we claim as much

[17:12] Berners to want this freedom

[17:16] Then I hope to God we don't we don't we don't flip the priorities and and sacrifice our freedom to get more means

[17:23] And so I had I had this was actually a real conversation which was spark of this entire presentation

[17:29] Is that it's hard to do the whole temporary argument so you know, it's like well, what if I just go there for a temporary period of time

[17:34] Stack enough cash and then I'll come back

[17:36] It's like the problem is that the enough number is going to change and it's very very hard to come back from paying zero percent

[17:41] You know, it's a paying a third or or half of your net worth and tax or a half your income and tax

[17:46] It's just hard mentally and not saying like you can still do the rational argument for why you're doing it

[17:49] But it's just like I think it's very hard emotionally to do it and the thing is is that if we are hard driving entrepreneurs

[17:55] Which we are we set up these games and move the goal post on ourselves and so you know

[17:59] I can promise you like my first freedom number was

[18:03] $4 million in after tax net worth and then I immediately and literally when we had four

[18:07] I was like, oh, I think 10 is actually more reasonable than 10 went to 14

[18:10] I've no idea what 14 was really like meaningful to me, but it was and then from 14 and went to 20 and then 20 went to 30

[18:15] Because that's what all trying out worth is and then it continues like okay now

[18:18] It's 100 and the thing is is the goal post continues to change because you become a cost you you literally get exposed to higher levels of wealth

[18:24] And then

[18:25] What you say is like okay, well this this this level of wealth allows me to live

[18:30] But I want to thrive and then when you're thriving then it's like why I want a super thrive

[18:34] And why can't I have an island in every single

[18:36] continent that belongs to me rather thing is you might and you might be listening to this and be like I would never do that

[18:41] Watch your tongue

[18:43] Because a lot of very smart people have said the same thing and

[18:46] Experience the same desire because we as hard driving people

[18:51] Play to win and to stay hungry you move the goal post, but in moving the goal coast

[18:56] You create a very difficult equation for yourself to be satisfied all right and so as a quick story to this

[19:01] I could have done and this is why

[19:04] Tax shelters diminish your life. I could have done an intentionally defective grantor trust

[19:08] Which is a fancy thing that basically functions like a waterfall of trusts where

[19:13] For every five million dollars of a sale that you're going to receive you out you you put it into a trust in the reason

[19:18] It's five million is because that's below the limit and you have to wait three years before you can touch the money because that's after

[19:24] The trust passes the statute of limitations on trust being unwell and by the IRS

[19:29] You're like wow, I like how do you know this because I've looked into this stuff, right and I could have saved my

[19:34] So about six million dollars in taxes right roughly if I had done this right I think we've been more than what I roughly

[19:40] But for what right to save more money that I don't need to know to needlessly

[19:44] Give myself something to worry about because I can't touch the money and I have to follow these

[19:47] stipulations and for some reason something happens that I have the IRS on my back and then

[19:51] Get audit it right and that little story that I told you earlier about the the captive that relative of mine

[19:58] They ended up getting audited and even if they do win

[20:02] What a headache just to save like four percent like who cares

[20:08] Right just go and make that much more money without having the stress of a darn audit

[20:14] And if they do lose now they're literally gonna have lost all the all the discovery time all the upkeep time all the conversion time

[20:21] All the the effort that goes into it

[20:24] They'll have to pay the fines and then they'll have to pay the cost of unwinding the darn thing right and all of the attention that all of that took

[20:29] They could have been spending on increasing the value of the thing that actually compounds tax free

[20:33] Which is their business?

[20:35] Right

[20:36] All right

[20:37] Okay

[20:38] So I didn't do the intensive grant to our trust and I just paid the darn taxes

[20:42] Which brings me to point number four which is that tax shelters don't make you a better person

[20:46] All right, so I only have two main points on this and I will I will drive this these hums because I think these are like as as we've gone down these points

[20:53] They become increasingly meaningful for me of actually how I make decisions and so these are the only two things that I've really made the decision with which is

[21:00] Number one is reputation risk

[21:02] I believe that I will be a billionaire at some point before I die at this point

[21:05] We have about a hundred million dollar in that worth semi-life and

[21:08] We're you know I'm 32 she's 29 and so like if I if we just get 10% a year like we will hit it

[21:15] And that's if we don't make any income and we don't grow businesses which that would drive me nuts

[21:19] And so we will be doing that so I think that at some point we will do that

[21:22] But who knows by then maybe billionaires everybody will be a billionaire in an apple cost of million bucks. Who knows?

[21:26] But the point is is that

[21:28] I would never want to become a billionaire and then have everyone say he did it and

[21:33] Discaped taxes. I just don't want that brand. I'm not saying there's no thing wrong with that

[21:37] Like I don't think there's actually anything wrong with that if you did it legally, right?

[21:41] But I would just prefer to be known as the person you pay to do is instill kill it

[21:44] That's just me that's a personal preference. That's a reputation risk for me

[21:47] Right, and I've said this quote before this channel, but I'll say it again like you only get one name and you have to keep it for the rest of your life

[21:55] Right, and so it's like investing in accordingly

[21:57] I can't imagine like that at that point in my life if I were a you know worth two billion or three billion and I could have been worth

[22:03] Remember guys like if you're saving 30% right under taxes

[22:08] It's only gonna anchor shouldn't that worth by that percentage like think about it

[22:12] So it's like if you're worth 10 million and you'd save 30% of your taxes

[22:16] You'd only be worth 30% more than that so be like 13 million right like and just think about it like that

[22:22] It's like so it's not like this crazy and like it's just that that's all it is

[22:26] Right, so number one is reputation or risking for me

[22:29] I don't think I would ever sacrifice my reputation for that marginal game all right number two

[22:36] 85 year old self test and

[22:38] This is my number one most tweeted tweet which is when I was 20

[22:41] I wanted to be a millionaire and now that one million I want to be 20 and I over her version of this which makes me realize it when I'm 40

[22:46] I'd rather just be 32 my age with nothing just to be 32 again

[22:50] Which is a different frame on gratitude that I thought I'd share which brings me to my 85 year old self test

[22:54] Which by the way is probably the most useful decision making frame I have ever made and it's probably the thing that I use

[22:59] The most in thinking through everything in my life all right, and so when I think about my 85 year old self

[23:05] Decapitated whatever and he's old and crass is hell and he's looking at 32 year old self

[23:11] Alex he laughs at me at the idea of sacrificing anything for money

[23:16] Sacrificing my youth to make more money that I won't need like I would give half of my net worth back to live my life

[23:23] Wherever I wanted to during my youth and to make 12% more net worth if you're deciding between

[23:28] States like will I care if I have 9 billion or you know or or 11 billion or 9 billion or 6 billion when I'd I know

[23:36] I won't and so I feel like I can be envisioned this conversation that I have with myself

[23:40] It's like don't don't sacrifice anything for me like I'm good. I'm old like you're young

[23:47] Enjoy like just soak in life because it's going to go away fast and

[23:52] Like most of the things that you're concerned about well matter and you won't always have more than enough

[23:57] And you will never go hungry and you will always have people around you love you and so like just live

[24:02] And so this idea of obsessing over these shackles that we're going to give back at the end of a life just seems

[24:07] So it didn't me and that's what at least why my 85 year old self laughs at me for thinking about these things rather than just spending time in the places that I want with people

[24:14] But I love all right, which brings me why number four is the tax lovers don't make you a better person all right

[24:18] So so far we covered number one tax lovers cost one they say number two

[24:22] Tax lovers don't increase in network number three taxes. There's don't improve your life and number four tax sellers don't make you a better person

[24:28] All right, and so if you're Moz nation you're like okay, well, what do I take from all this?

[24:31] I'm gonna give you six rules of thumb, which is why I added an extra finger on to that pump and then seven beliefs that have served me

[24:36] Well, I told you I'm gonna make one presentation to rule all others for myself and you so that I can also

[24:42] partially make this as an answer to a question that I had which is what do you do for taxes?

[24:45] So this is it all right, so if you're not gonna listen to any of the advice that I said up to this point and just pay your taxes

[24:50] Which by the way like to think our special sponsor the IRS

[24:54] For sponsoring this video six rules of thumb for you all right, so let's dive in real tax savings

[25:00] Typically come from three primary scenarios number one is when you give up ownership or control

[25:04] That's what charitable giving is right. That's why trust tend to be vehicles that people use because if you do them correctly

[25:10] You no longer own the money, which is why you don't know the taxes on it, right?

[25:12] That's the idea all right, so you either have to give up ownership or control typically to do that

[25:17] And so some people and they really see it. They're like, oh, like so this isn't my money anymore

[25:20] It's like yeah now you can make the argument like what you control it because you control the person blah blah blah

[25:24] But the thing is is like there's a lot of steps there and it's up to you

[25:27] But like that is like when the real saving stuff comes from things like that number two

[25:32] Is that they come from depreciation so in the tax code just like I mentioned earlier with real estate like the government wants

[25:39] Like the tax code is just an incentive plan, right?

[25:42] It's the government's way of saying we want you to do this and not do this right and so they allow you

[25:47] To depreciate assets that you were buying

[25:49] Which allows you to not pay taxes because they're basically functioning as losses right?

[25:53] So if I buy building for ten million dollars, I might be able to

[25:55] Depreciate four million dollars of that building and if I had made four million dollars that year

[26:00] Then I could depreciate and have zero tax which by the way is how most people who run real estate funds do it

[26:05] Is they don't give a lot of the depreciation the people who are investing and they as the general partners will take a disproportionate

[26:10] Another depreciation from a company from the funds that they raised so that they can pay you know money

[26:13] Which is how grant right I don't doesn't pay taxes right that's the idea that's how it does through depreciation

[26:18] All right number three is deferral over elimination all right and so this is also just a rule of thumb is that like

[26:24] A lot of the structures allow you to defer the taxes rather than eliminate them and so the ideas

[26:29] You basically defer them until you die, but you're not necessarily eliminating them

[26:32] So the three ways at least that I have seen they have they have been the most legitimate

[26:37] Across times it's et cetera

[26:39] Is or these concepts all right

[26:42] That being said here's some of the advice I have for you

[26:47] In almost all of these structures there is hair you must find it make sure it's really worth it

[26:51] Factor in the cost of discovery factor in the cost of conversion

[26:54] Factoring the cost of upkeep in a saving cost factor in the fee structure that they're gonna impose on Von you to do this whole thing

[27:00] Right and whenever you hear someone say the wealthy have been doing this forever

[27:02] It's just a sales pitch when they're like oh like the bond of builds have been doing the structure

[27:07] 100 like it's every single guy says that so just like just move on get over it

[27:11] Right, but you have to factor in the money at the time and the intentions of cost you and it and could you allocate that into your business

[27:17] Get a much higher return something to think about right

[27:20] Number three don't pretend to know things that you don't know don't be afraid to ask questions

[27:25] Seriously anyone who makes you feel otherwise is not to be trusted all right

[27:28] I always start and this is a very true every person my company would know this

[27:31] Especially my finest name like when we hop on calls with like experts on this stuff. I always say the same thing

[27:36] I say hey I just want you to pretend you're explaining the structure to a golden retriever all right

[27:40] Who speaks Spanish all right pictures simple words. I want to understand and if someone cannot explain something to you

[27:47] Simply it's either because they're trying to confuse it or they though it's because they do not understand it fully

[27:51] Think about that people if you are confused and someone cannot explain something simply to you

[27:57] It is because either they do not understand it or it is because they're desired

[28:01] Confusion and seem intelligent neither of those scenarios are good for you so if they connect cannot explain it to you

[28:07] Visually and simply

[28:09] I would say look run the other way all right because either they don't have the right intentions or they don't have the right skill level of skill

[28:14] All right

[28:16] So number four this is one now you're like okay

[28:19] I checked all the other boxes now always ask for people who've been doing the strategy for over a decade and

[28:23] Ask to speak with them the reason for that is because the IRS will unwind things three to five years after they

[28:29] Impose a clause because they'll find out that people are using it as a loophole in order to get through and a vague

[28:34] Taxis all right, and so what they'll do is that's why you need to look at people who've been doing this for over a decade

[28:39] Because they've already gone through a full IRS cycle and you can say okay

[28:42] You've been doing this for 11 years. You've never had any audits. You've never had any issues. Okay great

[28:47] Let me talk to three other people because you might have just been lucky

[28:50] Let me talk to you know a handful of people and see what was the cost of upkeep?

[28:54] What was the cost of conversion? What how much time per month you have to allocate to making sure that this continues to stay?

[28:59] You know within the standards of the IRS and then and then is it worth it right?

[29:04] Number five

[29:05] Always do background check on the person and the entities that the owner associate with quick story on this one

[29:10] I had a recent person say hey, I think this thing's really legit

[29:13] I think it checks all the boxes blah blah blah

[29:15] And so I looked into it which is not something that I'm gonna do because I've kind of like made up my mind on this

[29:19] Which is I just pay my taxes but that being said I decided to look into this one and literally on the first Google search

[29:24] I had of the guy who owned the entity

[29:25] All right, there's two there's two red flags right off the bat number one is that the entity was a brand new entity

[29:30] Which means that they're spinning up new entities all the time that is a big easy red flag of like why don't you have the same entity

[29:35] Why are you trying to always change?

[29:37] Entices all the time it seems weird. There's no reviews online, et cetera. Okay second is

[29:43] If and after I googled this person they had literally been indicted

[29:49] for tax evasion

[29:50] And that's like

[29:52] But and like one of the biggest tax evasion scandals in history right and

[29:57] And you know the guy made the intro was like but they got acquitted and I'm like

[30:01] Do you want the reputational risk of being associated with someone like that right and it's someone someone might be like hey

[30:07] Alex can't believe you forgive. He was proven it like I get it

[30:10] There's just other people who haven't and for me

[30:12] I would rather just not take the risk. That's just my two cents all right

[30:15] So always do a background check on the people in the entities that they own and are associated with all right

[30:21] And then finally don't spend money on stuff that you wouldn't just to expense it all right

[30:27] This is one that I hear all the times like just expensive expensive expensive right I'm saving

[30:30] Expersonage on this like if you if you spend money that you otherwise wouldn't in order to save

[30:35] Money because you don't have to pay taxes on the money. It's cutting off

[30:38] You're nose despite your face right like it's like oh I don't want to pay 30% of a hundred dollars or 40% of a hundred dollars

[30:45] So I'm just gonna not even have a hundred dollars

[30:48] Right, that just doesn't make a lot of sense to me now if you were going to do it then by all means like if you want to reinvest in the business

[30:54] And that that's expensive all then great then wonderful as long as it's the asset

[30:57] And here's the key point is like if we can if we can if we can figure out a way that it can become an asset that's going to build value

[31:03] Within the company and somehow it's expensive all and fantastic right that's the idea

[31:08] But spending money on stuff that that you wouldn't otherwise just to not pay taxes is a very very very

[31:15] Silly way of living life in my opinion and ultimately not one that is a good

[31:19] Behavior that will build wealth over time all right

[31:21] So these are just my six rules of thumb that if you're not going to listen to the advice at least please do these things when you're thinking through some of these other

[31:27] Tax structures that you come with and then finally these are the beliefs that I currently hold

[31:31] I'm not saying you have to hold these but these are the things that have served me very well

[31:34] All right

[31:35] So number one is that attention is my number one most valuable asset never do anything that takes it without disproportionate return number two

[31:42] pays zero attention to tax haven seems focused on the making of the saving number three

[31:46] Whenever it decides to come up right number three

[31:49] There we go replace savings with orders of magnitude so instead of trying to think in increments thinking orders of magnitude instead of saving 10%

[31:56] Thing about how can I 10x and then you'll never have to worry about the taxes again

[31:59] Number four never count your pennies on roads and taken

[32:01] All right, it'll destroy your spirit and have you focused on the wrong part of your life your past versus the future

[32:06] So if you make one of the decisions to start living in the place you want to live

[32:08] We're living a state that you that you feel like being in whatever right don't start thinking I could have saved

[32:12] 12% over the last four years and if I had that money right now like don't do that

[32:16] It'll destroy your life and probably you might not have made that money that you made now because you would not have been in this headspace

[32:21] That you are currently et cetera right and the other day

[32:23] There's just there's no benefit to so once you make the decision move on all right number five

[32:28] This one and this is this is a big one. All right

[32:31] Just remember that when I die and this is me right remembering that when I die the people that I compare myself to will also be dead

[32:37] Right and here's a crazy one we will all be taxed at 100% as in we don't get to keep it no matter what and

[32:44] So here's my here's the probably the best analogy that I can give you which is a casino analogy

[32:48] And this is this is kind of how I imagine really life in the game overall right

[32:53] Which is that I believe all of us are given a token in the in the casino of life

[32:58] Right and we walk in the door and we sit down to the table and there's a bunch of other players around and we can and we get

[33:03] Doubt cards and we play the cards that were done right and depending on our skill

[33:08] In the game we can continue to amass in a mess chips, right?

[33:11] And we get these stacks and stacks and stacks of chips

[33:13] But the difference between a regular casino and the casino of life is in the regular casino

[33:17] You can take these big chicks go to the counter cash out take a cash celebrate et cetera

[33:22] And then you get to go spend that money but in the casino of life

[33:26] You have this big stack of chips and then when the grim reaper taps you on the shoulder and says you can't play anymore

[33:32] You have to get up from table and the chips stay on the table and what they do is they push them right to the middle of the table and everyone keeps playing with your chips

[33:39] And so for me when I think about it

[33:43] It's like do I just want to be in a nice casino or a shitty casino, but at the end of the day

[33:46] I have to give all the chips back

[33:49] And so for me when I think about it like that it's like no matter what happens

[33:52] I'm getting taxed 100% upon death and you might be like oh legacy it's at to me that's silly

[33:57] Because sure multiply by 100 generations of people who don't know you changed the last names and have mixed their their genetics with you

[34:03] You know

[34:04] One half to the hundredth power and no they're just humans and no they don't remember you and no they're not your

[34:09] Your descendants they're just humans and so all of that stuff goes away with time and so it's like

[34:14] We're just here to play the game and all of the chips that we unless are gonna get put back in the middle anyways

[34:18] And why sacrifice the lighting and the niceness and the types of people that I get to play the game with

[34:24] So that I can potentially keep a higher percentage of chips again the table that I'm only gonna give back at the end

[34:28] Something to think about and then finally money exists to buy his options therefore

[34:33] Jeanne trade option out of you for all right so

[34:37] If you are new to this channel, thank you

[34:39] I make these videos because no one helped me learn this stuff I had to learn this stuff on my own or to pay a lot of money for these lessons

[34:44] Either in mistakes or in experts in advice and so I hope that the pain that I experienced isn't in vain

[34:49] Which is why I make these videos. I just hope that someone can benefit from it

[34:53] And I like this visual here because we have these goals we fail we learn principles we improve and then we have more audacious goals

[34:58] And my goal for you guys is that you can just jump from audacious goals tomorrow

[35:02] Adacious goals because you can just use the lessons that someone also's already learned and suffered the pain of

[35:06] Consequence for all right I repurposed that from Ray Dahlia's principles, but I just really like that visual and so

[35:11] Anyways, welcome most ination if you're new

[35:13] Appreciate you enjoy the video hopefully some of these takeaways can be helpful in your journey

[35:17] All our taxes and entrepreneurs so love you and I'll see you in the next vid

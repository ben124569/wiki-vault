[00:00] This is more brutally honest advice to my younger poor self.

[00:03] This advice is only for somebody who wants to make more money, grow in their business, grow in themselves.

[00:07] People obsessed with their morning routines, make less money than people obsessed with making money.

[00:11] People were sacrifice, and then they get rich.

[00:14] Then they fill their time with weird routines.

[00:17] Then they forget how they got rich in the first place.

[00:19] And then they tell other people the weird routines made them rich,

[00:23] rather than what they actually did, which is whatever it took, not some three-hour morning routine.

[00:28] There was a kid who DM me who said, hey, I've been working with this business coach,

[00:33] and he has me doing a morning routine.

[00:36] It could not make this up.

[00:37] After I do my grounded walking, I do my gratitude journal, I do my list for the day, I do my ice plunge.

[00:44] So after I do that, he takes me about three hours in the morning to get all that done.

[00:47] He's like, I barely have any energy to actually get worked on.

[00:49] I just said, I'm going to give you the biggest hack in the world.

[00:52] Cut the three-hour morning routine, replace it with three hours of work, and I promise you get more done.

[00:55] Any message from me back week later, he was like, dude, it changed my whole life.

[00:58] I'm getting so much done.

[00:59] And I was like, what a fucking concept.

[01:01] If you work more, more gets done.

[01:02] And I love just looking at this, it's like, what actions do I have to take to get what I want?

[01:06] Anything that is not that is a distraction from it.

[01:09] Period.

[01:09] If it takes you five minutes to feel 20% better, and you can actually measure that you're

[01:13] out because of by 20% and cool, that makes sense.

[01:16] So I'm not against doing things.

[01:18] I'm against doing things for the sake of doing them.

[01:21] And so one of the biggest issues with learning and education, as humans do it, is that we

[01:27] make correlations to things that are approximate.

[01:29] They're close to one another.

[01:30] Tall people play basketball.

[01:31] I should play basketball to get tall.

[01:32] We make these very mistaken correlations, but we should look at is what it took to get there,

[01:37] not what they're doing now.

[01:38] So the better advice is to look at what someone was doing on their way up in the grind, mirror that,

[01:43] more than what they're currently doing at the top of the mountain.

[01:45] So it would be like, assuming Warren Buffett is rich because he drinks coke.

[01:48] He drinks probably five, 12 ounce coke today.

[01:51] All you have to do also on the core areas are there other people who drink coke who aren't rich.

[01:55] I've had probably 10 different podcasts.

[01:57] Seed the premise.

[01:59] Do you think that the fact that you had a hard childhood has created the success today?

[02:04] And I would say, no, I would say the work that I did created the success.

[02:08] And all we have to do is look at all the other people who had bad childhoods who aren't successful.

[02:13] And I think there are way more of those than there are that are to prove that it actually has nothing to do.

[02:18] With who's successful.

[02:19] There's also people who didn't have bad childhoods who are successful too.

[02:22] And so it's just that many people have bad childhoods.

[02:25] Some of them become successful.

[02:27] And so that's why I trying to figure out why something happened.

[02:30] I have spent less and less of my effort trying to do that.

[02:33] And only look at what actions created the result.

[02:37] Rather than looking at intention or anything else that's a morphist that can't be measured.

[02:43] 30 isn't the new 20.

[02:45] It's an excuse to take 10 years longer to do a confidence same thing.

[02:48] You can die when you're done until then.

[02:50] Keep going.

[02:51] In your 20s, you're young.

[02:52] You can fuck around.

[02:53] It doesn't matter because life is longer.

[02:55] Number one, that assumes that you're not going to die.

[02:58] If you're in your 30s, you know someone in your high school class who died.

[03:00] And it's not just the drug overdose people.

[03:02] It's the people who got shot.

[03:04] Got an a car accident.

[03:05] Had a weird brain cancer.

[03:06] I've had all of those things happen to people that I with high school.

[03:09] In one way, I think it's a little bit arrogant to assume that you're just going to live.

[03:12] Because it means you can waste your life.

[03:14] And I'd wholeheartedly stand against that.

[03:15] The second translation around that that I think has hurt a lot of people is that they can do

[03:21] but I would consider dead end jobs.

[03:23] And that means jobs that don't have any direct correlation to your personal growth.

[03:28] Has nothing to do with pay.

[03:29] You're going work for free and grow more than anyone else.

[03:31] This is not saying that you need to go into a season of earning in your 20s.

[03:34] But you do need to be setting yourself up for growth in my opinion.

[03:38] If you want the big ultimate outcome.

[03:41] And so most people that at least consume my stuff, they want to be better.

[03:45] They want to grow.

[03:46] They want to get a better shape.

[03:47] They want to have better relationships.

[03:48] They want to have a better business.

[03:49] They want to be bigger and every way.

[03:51] They want to expand.

[03:52] If you spend the decade of your 20s.

[03:55] Not growing and not investing in your skills and your education.

[03:59] If you do that in your 30s, you're going to be further behind that someone starts in their 20s.

[04:02] You're going to be a decade behind.

[04:03] You know, nowadays there's kids who are starting out the entrepreneur older and they're like 13.

[04:07] And so when they're 23, they're Mr. Beast.

[04:09] He's young but he's actually pretty old in business terms.

[04:12] Because a lot of people start their business journey in their mid 40s.

[04:15] And so if they're 50 years old and started their business five years ago,

[04:18] Mr. Beast says twice the amount of time in the ring under the bar that they do.

[04:22] For me, I want to start my time clock on paying down my ignorance debt as fast as

[04:27] it's usually possible because the debt is a constant for everyone.

[04:30] All of us are trying to pay down that debt as fast as we can.

[04:32] And taking a decade, arguably one of the most productive decades of your life.

[04:36] And not paying down that debt.

[04:38] You just sit in such a deficit compared to your peer group.

[04:41] Some people might watch this in B30 or 40 or 50 and be like, well, shit.

[04:44] I took the wrong advice from the wrong guy.

[04:46] Guess what? You're going to die. It's not going to matter anyways.

[04:48] Big deal, whatever.

[04:49] The best time to do this was start when you were 10 and get born to an entrepreneurial parent

[04:54] who got you in their small business and invested in all of your education as a home school student

[04:58] and taught you all the ways of the of the Jedi.

[05:01] But you probably didn't have that.

[05:03] And so the second most time is to start now because let's play out the alternative.

[05:06] How much does it serve you to just say, I guess I have no chance?

[05:09] Okay, die.

[05:11] There's nothing left for me to do.

[05:13] I will relinquish the remainder of my living days in years

[05:17] because I choose to lose.

[05:19] And that's a choice. And if you want that, that's cool.

[05:20] The idea of quitting simply because you're older because you didn't do something.

[05:25] Everybody doesn't do things that they know they should be doing now.

[05:30] And that's because you're always going to know more in the future than you do in the past.

[05:34] And so it's a faulty premise to say that I'm not going to take action today

[05:38] because I didn't know something in the past.

[05:40] Everyone doesn't know anything in the past.

[05:42] But all you can do is take action with what you know today.

[05:44] And by taking action, you have learned.

[05:47] And so you actually take one step to making your first payment on ignorance that

[05:51] through actions not words.

[05:52] I mean, I think a lot of people know the story of the 30-year-old peristair.

[05:55] If you love that, then do it.

[05:57] You know what I mean? I have no judgment on what you do.

[05:59] If you don't love that and you wish you were doing something else,

[06:03] that's what I would say I have a problem with.

[06:04] Which is why you're not doing it.

[06:06] And I think diving into that, which is usually some sort of fear,

[06:09] some sort of anxiety, some sort of label that they believe that isn't true from someone else.

[06:14] And just trying to zone in on like, why am I not doing it?

[06:17] And taking two steps closer to it, not just like,

[06:19] because I don't know what I'm doing.

[06:20] Well, duh, okay, neither does anyone.

[06:22] What are you doing about that?

[06:23] Just defining it to what actions are I going to take as a result?

[06:26] Just makes life a lot easier.

[06:27] What's figured out, I mean?

[06:28] It means that I'm going to read two hours a night on a specific subject

[06:31] until I feel like I can make a decision within 30 days on what I'm going to do.

[06:34] Great.

[06:35] That is something I can do and I can measure where I did it.

[06:39] You have seasons of earning and you have seasons of learning.

[06:41] I had this kid who reached out, he was 18 years old, said he was going to edit videos for us.

[06:46] When he came in, he said, I want $100,000 a year as an editor.

[06:51] Does it starting?

[06:52] Job. His reasoning was that somebody else had offered him that amount of money.

[06:57] I want to make this statement because I think it's logical and also stupid.

[07:00] If you're optimizing for your earning potential in your 20s,

[07:04] you're missing the fucking point.

[07:05] This individual had the potential to be on a team that has a massively globally recognized brand

[07:12] in terms of media and from there learn how to be way better than they currently are.

[07:17] And then become a creative director at another company or at one of my portfolio companies.

[07:22] Like that is the career path.

[07:23] And instead was comparing that to something that if you would make $100,000 a year and be the only

[07:28] person in the department and no one there knew anything about media.

[07:31] And so he wasn't going to learn.

[07:34] He was going to earn.

[07:35] Whereas somebody who got into the big leagues and learned 10 times the skill set,

[07:40] then 10 years later, is either starting a multi-million dollar company or hitting a

[07:45] multi-million dollar division in a billion dollar company.

[07:48] And the potential is so much wider because 10 years from now someone says,

[07:51] what's your experience is like, well, I worked at a real estate firm and I made their social media

[07:55] content.

[07:56] Who gives a shit?

[07:57] Whereas if you're like, I worked for one of the biggest media companies out there,

[08:00] everyone will give you the job offer.

[08:01] And that is when you can choose to earn over a learn.

[08:04] But people make the trade too soon because they compare themselves to people on social media

[08:09] and think that the 0.001% is the norm.

[08:13] Whenever you choose to earn rather than learn, you're right-hooking life and saying,

[08:17] I'm no longer going to develop and this is good enough.

[08:19] And so if 100,000 a year is actually good enough for your long-term goals, then do it.

[08:22] But I would imagine that it probably isn't for what you really want to do long-term.

[08:26] And I'm using 100, you know, six figures as a placeholder can be whatever number you want.

[08:30] When you make that decision that you're no longer going to learn,

[08:32] that's when you stop growing your potential to learn more.

[08:34] I say this because that's what I did.

[08:36] I had a white collar, consulting job for defense contracting,

[08:39] on a top-secret clearance.

[08:40] I had everything that looked good on paper, a space-iron intelligence.

[08:43] I had a two to three-year path clearly for getting an MBA at an Ivy League school.

[08:47] And then decided to drop all of that and start working for $13 an hour at a gym.

[08:52] After I graduated, I had to come out of here in three years from Vanderbilt.

[08:55] I know what I'm asking people to do, and I'm not asking them to do something that I wasn't

[08:59] willing to do.

[08:59] And I think that I might have even a more extreme version that most people are having to live with.

[09:03] Trying to say, like, well, I can't figure out what I want is a really paralyzing place to be

[09:08] that I think a lot of young people are in.

[09:09] It's like I want to find my passion.

[09:11] But the big misnomer is actually a language issue, which is that people say they want to find their

[09:16] passion around it.

[09:16] They want to build it or create it or learn it.

[09:18] And so I can promise you that if you're good at something, you're like doing it.

[09:21] And the only way that you get good at something is by doing things that you suck at and do a lot of it.

[09:26] So let's say you make $50,000 a year.

[09:28] It cost you $950,000 a year, not to know how to make a million dollars a year.

[09:33] So how much is that education worth?

[09:36] Answer?

[09:37] The difference.

[09:38] The difference between $1 million and $50,000, which is $950 grand,

[09:42] if you learn how to make a million dollars, the education is worth the difference.

[09:47] It's why education and information are the most valuable things that we can know.

[09:51] Elon has lost everything and then gained it back.

[09:54] So many of the best entrepreneurs have stories where they lost it all and then gained it back.

[09:57] And so how is it that they can go to zero?

[09:59] Back to a billion, where somebody starting at zero can't get there because they didn't lose the

[10:03] education.

[10:04] They didn't lose the learning.

[10:05] They had a bad role.

[10:06] And sometimes in business you do make bets on markets and sometimes they don't shape up.

[10:11] But you didn't lose in a lot of times you actually gain an experience so that the next bet

[10:16] pays off you've been bigger.

[10:17] Everyone gets this wrong.

[10:18] The most expensive thing you ever pay for isn't your car.

[10:22] It isn't your house.

[10:23] It isn't your insurance.

[10:24] It's the information that you don't know but should.

[10:27] I mean, how many things can you think of right now that if you knew 10 years ago

[10:30] would have materially changed your financial outcome, your relational outcome,

[10:34] your physical outcomes, probably a lot.

[10:36] What is the value of that information?

[10:38] Or do I in priceless?

[10:39] And so the idea that we wouldn't invest in paying down that debt of ignorance that we owe the universe

[10:45] is just because we don't know who we're paying the check to every month for the things that we don't

[10:49] know that we don't value it appropriately.

[10:52] The cost of success is the years of feeling like an idiot for things that you should have known

[10:56] by now.

[10:57] All the decisions that I made up to this point led me to here and I don't regret my life

[11:00] so I don't regret not knowing.

[11:02] I mean, if I started over, I'd be wealthy than I am now.

[11:05] You don't even.

[11:07] I can't go back in time but if I could go back in time to talk to my 20 year old self and it

[11:11] wouldn't change the outcome of my life now because I would never roll that dice.

[11:14] It's I would say there's two things that you don't understand that will massively change your life.

[11:17] You don't understand brand and you don't understand product because I was obsessive in my 20s

[11:23] on sales and marketing and what I would consider fast money.

[11:26] I had fast feedback loops so I'd get better at sales and then I'd immediately make more sales.

[11:30] I'd get better marketing and immediately make more money.

[11:32] And so I had this very fast feedback loop that gave me the misinformation or the false belief

[11:37] that this was the right path but I was actually just playing the wrong game because it's kind of

[11:42] like in the matrix when Neo system or FIS.

[11:45] So you're saying when I'm fast enough, I'll be able to dodge bullets and you said no,

[11:48] I'm saying when you're ready, you won't have to.

[11:50] Me being obsessive about sales and marketing was me trying to get faster and faster in the matrix

[11:56] and not being the one and seeing the code for what it is, which is that if you make a product that's

[12:01] good enough, people will do the marketing and sales for you.

[12:05] If your brand is strong enough, people will make the association that they want to buy your

[12:09] stuff regardless of how good your copy and your headline and your landing pages and your

[12:14] conversion rate optimization and your media buying are.

[12:16] I kept getting really good at a game that if I knew how to master the big things that matter

[12:20] would make those skills almost irrelevant.

[12:22] When 100 million dollars offers came out the book, I didn't make it for anything.

[12:26] I made it for me and it was originally intended to be an internal document and so I just

[12:29] wanted to make it exceptional and what happened once I released it is what shocked me the most was that

[12:34] I posted once and I just said, hey, I wrote this book up because like it and then we sold out

[12:39] in minutes and I was like, that's weird.

[12:40] The next month, more copies sold and then the next month, more copies sold and the next month,

[12:44] more copies sold and it's continued to sell more copies month after month after month for two years

[12:47] and it's still number one and it's category on Amazon and that was with zero paid marketing.

[12:52] Purely, off of people telling people about the book and so when I saw how much leverage that was

[12:58] that that book sells thousands a day.

[13:01] Not dollars, thousands of copies a day.

[13:03] I have never marketed anything well enough to sell a thousand customers a day.

[13:08] Now mind you, I've always had more expensive stuff that I've sold but like I'd never seen that kind

[13:12] of transaction volume and the only way to get that kind of transaction volume is to have a huge amount

[13:15] of leverage. The leverage that product unlocked from here that understanding was that if you

[13:20] make it good enough and I love this saying which is there's two big defail and I love the other

[13:24] which is two good defail. My headline for a hundred million dollars, makes no sense.

[13:29] No, no is a hundred million dollar offers is and it's just like a picture of a hundred dollar bill.

[13:33] It's a big purple book like it actually makes no sense but the contents of the book were valuable

[13:37] that people were like just just read it and they said it so many times so many people and most people

[13:42] who when I see the comments and I see the reviews they say I had four different people in the same

[13:47] month tell me in different groups that I should read this book so I decided to do it even though

[13:52] it looked hokey and oh my god this thing is unbelievable and then they tell 20 people or a hundred

[13:56] people. That was when I realized how much leverage spending more time up front on building a better

[14:00] product would unlock for me. What I used to do was spend two months building a good product and

[14:05] spent two years marketing that product with great marketing rather than spending two years on a great

[14:12] product and then for the rest of my life not having to spend any dollars or effort on marketing

[14:16] so that it would sell again and again and again because of the quality of the product itself.

[14:22] And so that was the first lesson that my owner self needed to understand about business and the level

[14:28] of detail that it takes to go from good to great is so much wider than people think it is. The

[14:32] difference between an eight and a nine is ten times the work. The difference between nine and nine and

[14:36] half is ten times the work. The difference between nine and half and nine points and five is another

[14:39] ten times the work. It's so much more effort and honestly when I was younger I couldn't even

[14:43] comprehend the amount of work that I can do now and for me that amount of work is the amount of

[14:47] unbroken focus time that I can stick with one task. I did not have that level of focus. I didn't

[14:52] have a strong enough no muscle. I didn't know how to turn down other things that would distract me

[14:56] for long enough. If you can count in terms of hundreds like I can promise you if you put a thousand

[15:00] hours into something it'll probably be pretty good and most people spend like a hundred hours on

[15:05] something or I mean that's shit. Let's put up some even less the time in that. You start a clock

[15:09] when you start working stop a clock when you stop working. You spend a thousand hours or two thousand

[15:13] hours on something. There's a level of detail because of the number of exposures you'll get to it.

[15:17] The crispy details of the product or the service that can only come from looking at that thing when

[15:23] it's cold looking at things when it's hot looking at it when you're angry looking at it when you're

[15:27] sad looking at it when you're inspired looking at it when you're bored you see it with different lenses

[15:31] and then what happens is it just gives you so much more depth and context to whatever you're trying

[15:35] to build that that's the difference between mediocre products and excellent products and it just takes

[15:39] time. In an ocean of volume which there's more commoditized products and services today than ever before

[15:46] there's outsized returns to being number one. It is an even bigger winter take all market now than

[15:51] ever has been because of social media and the ease of letting other people know about stuff. If you are

[15:56] truly the best everyone will know and if everyone knows you are the best you have more demand

[16:00] that you can possibly do people think that word of mouth is dead when there's literally never been

[16:04] an easier way to go viral in a literal sense for people telling other people about stuff.

[16:10] I said the second lesson was brand and so I had to look at a company or brand as a learning tool

[16:18] as what are people going to learn to associate my brand with the tangible and the

[16:23] intangible ideas there are many people that I associated with when I was younger that I would never

[16:28] associate with today even though I would say well I don't act that way I don't live my life the way

[16:32] they live their lives people would still make that association if I did nothing but talk with

[16:36] porn stars on my show people would still make a very different association with me and so I want to

[16:43] embody certain values that I want my brand to associate with and anything that is not those things

[16:49] by default the tracks from it because it delutes the association. Branding is like creating a garden

[16:55] we're pretty much anything but the flower that you're trying to grow there is a weed even if it's

[16:59] a daffodil even if it's a sunflower even if the flower itself is fine like I said I have no issues

[17:03] with porn I think it's a sunflower whatever but if I'm trying to grow roses then anything that's

[17:07] not a rose doesn't belong being so vigilant about defending that garden of association and

[17:14] reputation gives you so much leverage because the reason we're above it now can just due deals that

[17:18] no one else can do is because his handshake means more than the US government if he says he will pay

[17:23] we know he will pay if he says he will be there to ensure your entire city we know he will

[17:28] he can do a deal on a one-page agreement for billions of dollars because people trust and they know

[17:34] that his reputation matters more than anything to him and so trust is leverage for deals it's

[17:39] leverage for sales the first experience I had with having a strong brand was one we were probably

[17:45] a year and a half into gym lunch I launched what would become Alan my software project and when

[17:50] people heard I had launched a new thing the clients that I had were sending screenshots of their

[17:56] credit cards to my customer support team saying I don't know what it was but if Alex made it up

[18:01] and so all of the ideas in the obsessions run how he's going to market it and how he's going to

[18:06] position it the thing that mattered most was what they had already received for me and how much I

[18:12] delivered on my first promise and so when I realized that I was like all of the sales and marketing

[18:17] stuff gets you one sale delivering exceptional product and exceptional reputation around your products

[18:22] gets you every other sale after that and you could always be able to sell the next thing provided

[18:27] you delivered on the first day and that's where there's the obsession with marketing because there's

[18:31] always more people to sell to it's a very in my opinion tiring life you always have to go get new

[18:36] customers if you make sales to get customers rather than get customers to make sales you make the

[18:43] customer the goal and then you get to keep that relationship and then next year you still have that

[18:47] customer if you've got a customer just to make a sale you have to go get another customer to make

[18:51] another sale next year but if you make a sale to create the relationship of the customer then next

[18:55] year that customer will buy again and the new customer will buy and the third year you get the first

[19:00] two years and the third customer and then that is how you create a compounding vehicle and so both

[19:04] of those things brand and product are actually underlying one concept now that I'm saying it out loud

[19:09] which is I didn't understand compounding I thought that it was normal to have to go out

[19:14] bang doors, call phones, DM, run ads to get customers every single month and then next month I'm

[19:19] going to have to get another 20 just to keep the lights on rather than having spent more time on my

[19:24] reputation and the quality of my product so that when I sold the first hundred they would never leave

[19:29] again and then they would send me the next hundred and I wouldn't have to do anything and then

[19:33] I would be able to fend people off and then I'd be able to raise my prices and be able to take

[19:36] people on my terms but I didn't understand you that and part of that is because I wanted money so fast

[19:41] and building a great product takes longer building a great reputation literally never stops

[19:45] until the day you die. Leaning into that lesson you know the first book I launched and I think it did

[19:51] two or four thousand copies sold its first month something like that you know the second book

[19:55] that launched two years later sold 250,000 copies in the first month which for context the average

[20:00] near times past sell ourselves between ten and a hundred thousand and it's first twelve months

[20:04] and we sold two fifty in the first month the only way that that could happen is if the people who

[20:08] bought the first book by the second book and everybody they tell also might and that book

[20:13] still continues to sell at twice the rate of my first book today. Here's how to spot friends

[20:19] that are worth cutting they only talk about your past not your future so if you go and you hang out with

[20:25] your buddies and all they can really reminisce with you on is the things that you did together but none of

[20:29] them are talking about what they're going to do or what you're going to do for me that's a telltale

[20:33] sign that they're living in the past they're not even living in the present they're best years are behind them

[20:37] and for most of us we want our best years to be ahead of us and we want somebody who's also looking

[20:41] at the same goal as us which is growth which is moving forward just making progress if you are

[20:46] growth-oriented individual and you feel like you're not sure about your environment or

[20:50] if it's conducive the easiest limit test is who talks about the future and who talks about the

[20:56] past keep the ones who we're only talking about the future cut the ones talking about the best.

[20:59] The best thing that I ever did was not listen to other people's opinions about my life they

[21:04] don't want the best version of you they want the version of you who best serves them. Now when I first

[21:09] said this I got a flag from a bunch of parents they're like I really want the best for my kids

[21:15] is like that's not true you want a version of your children who serves what you think will make you look the best.

[21:23] Family I would say more often than not has a closer alignment with your long-term goals than

[21:29] strangers do and so it makes sense that family would have more aligned interests but not completely

[21:34] aligned interests with you because the only person who has a completely aligned interest with you is

[21:37] future you. Keeping that as the limit test of who's opinion I'm going to listen to although it's

[21:42] more difficult has ultimately been very fruitful for me because if you're looking at two even two

[21:46] parents you can just prove that concept by saying okay well both parents want different things for me.

[21:51] Of the things that both parents want which of the things help each of the parents individually

[21:55] out because I can promise you that the thing that one parent wants doesn't hurt them and help the other

[21:59] parent if they disagree it's usually something that's more aligned with their world view they're believed

[22:03] or what they will get status from in their community for you doing and so all of the things I

[22:08] just described have nothing to do with you so why consider it. I'll say this upfront I hate why

[22:13] questions because who knows why but I would say that if if I had to make a guess on why we care

[22:18] about other people's opinions it's because we've learned to care about other people's opinions and

[22:21] when we're children we learn to orient ourselves to the world through other people telling us what is

[22:26] what literally when you're a kid you point and then you say what's that and then they say this and

[22:32] so you have to listen to other people on the way up the problem is at some point you have to turn it

[22:38] off and say you know some of the people I was listening to had no idea what they were saying but you

[22:41] don't know they have no idea because you have a context to make a judgment you have to learn to

[22:44] become human and then you have to learn to become yourself and I think that at that turning point

[22:48] you then have to analyze the beliefs that you've been given and then keep the ones that you choose

[22:54] most parents are risk averse rather than risk taking for their children so like we're willing to

[22:59] take more risk for ourselves oftentimes that our parents are willing to take on our behalf and I think

[23:02] that's normally when we like keep you alive there's a lot of evolutionary drive behind that and so

[23:06] they're playing not to lose but if you want to play to win you have to take different bets

[23:09] I think a lot of younger people get really confused because they spend a lot of time talking about

[23:13] ideas and very little talking about doing actions and so if you just define the world by only

[23:18] things that occur in it and not things that occur in your mind there's a lot less noise and so

[23:24] becomes easier to see the forest with trees let's say I have been employed and I want to hop

[23:28] on a one on one and they said something in a meeting before and I say I think the intention behind

[23:32] your statement was that you wanted me to do this and this is how I was feeling about your statement

[23:38] and this is probably where you were feeling everything I just said is a plea waste of time because

[23:42] all I know is that they said this and so just focus on the facts and if you can do that it actually

[23:47] makes living life a lot easier or navigating life a lot easier at least it has for me because those

[23:52] are the only objective truths and easy frame for that is like what it be admitted to a court as evidence

[23:58] you saying you were offended is not evidence john said this to Sally these words that's evidence

[24:03] indisputable and so just look at the things that are beyond reproach look at the things that are

[24:07] indisputable look at things that are facts that are observable and the world gets a lot

[24:10] quieter and you also realize that most people are full of shit and don't know what they're talking about

[24:14] I mean if someone was like hey Alex why did you get into business I could make up an answer

[24:18] it just how do we know it's true trying to figure out someone's intention is bullshit if someone

[24:23] asked me why did you get into business I could make up an answer anyone can make up an answer why

[24:28] do you like making money why do you like sales why do you like marketing why are you good at this

[24:32] I can make up any answer all I know is that these things have occurred and so we can look at my

[24:38] actions and we can look at the results the rest of it of which which had what influence I don't

[24:42] like I can't relive my life and I can't run the experiment and so trying to determine why

[24:46] like was it because my mom didn't hug me was it because my dad hug me too hard who knows

[24:49] I can give anyone and someone will not and say great because we trained ourselves to say to answer

[24:53] when someone says why do you do that you give the words and they not and say that's interesting

[24:57] but like it doesn't mean it's true and so I just try and skirt the whole conversation because

[25:01] there's no point so when someone's like well I'm the type of person who I'm like just stop then they

[25:06] start using this label to decide whether or why the can or can't do something I wouldn't be

[25:12] successful that because I'm a need for you why because you take trash out of your car regularly why

[25:17] does that have anything to do with whether you could do this or not I used to think and told people

[25:21] I was bad at math until I was 25 post college post consulting job all of it and then I decided

[25:26] that I was not going to be bad at math and so I was like okay well I'm not going to be a calculator

[25:31] and so then I started getting better and better at doing math problem and then lo and behold

[25:35] when I took the g-man I was like okay I have to study twice as hard for the math section and I did

[25:39] just as well on the math section as I did on my verbal but my whole life I had said I was bad at math

[25:45] and so I didn't study as hard because I was bad at it everyone who's listening to this has

[25:48] something they say about themselves so like I'm not organized I'm an early bird right like we

[25:52] have these labels we give ourselves but like why do we have these labels like if you need to

[25:56] wake up early to fucking wake up early if you need to stay up late but you stay up late

[25:59] the labels change our behavior more than we change the labels I really have horrible labels

[26:03] overall because I feel like it limits my action when I get on podcasts and I have talks and people

[26:08] trying label me you'll probably actively see me break the label almost every time because I'm

[26:13] really aware of it and a lot of people aren't then I don't think people do it on purpose in a bad way

[26:17] I just think that they will speak things over you which is why I hate going home because no one

[26:21] speaks shit over you more than your family and the people in the United States school out to

[26:24] always had a short temper you're a hothead literally people from home describe me that way

[26:29] I was like oh my god they will say that and then I feel like I have to really put up my

[26:33] mental like defenses to be like this is not true here is the evidence that this is not true

[26:38] what would a hothead do in these scenarios that is not the way it behaved therefore right and I

[26:42] have to I have to basically unwind that shit whenever I go there and so that is why I've been an

[26:47] advocate of like if you want to change your behavior change your environment because they're not

[26:49] going to reinforce labels that you then also perpetuate in your own minds by the actions you take as

[26:54] and the only reason they want to label is because it's short hand for other people to understand

[26:58] not because it's true they just want to say he had a bad child and so they take your whole life and

[27:02] they say bad that's not true there's more nuance to it I prefer to think of ideals and think of

[27:07] taking steps towards those ideals and since ideals are not binary of like he is courageous

[27:11] or he is not courageous but how courageous is he or how patient is he not impatient or patient but how

[27:15] much then I know the values that I want to embody and then I just take steps towards as

[27:21] every day with the actions I take and so if I'm deciding don't want to take this action I'll say

[27:25] which action aligns most of the values that I want to embody and then I try to do that so rather than

[27:30] being like Alex is patient be like Alex attempts to act in accordance with the value of patience

[27:35] and sometimes fall short but tries his darkness

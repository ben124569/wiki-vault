[00:00] two or three things happen in our lives, handful of days that just seem to be this repeated

[00:04] thing and it reminded me that a lot of people struggle with this, which is they believe

[00:11] that they are inherently bad at things because they are not good at them.

[00:17] And I think that that is an incredibly dangerous belief set to have.

[00:21] And so what I want to do is kind of break that belief set down to hopefully break it for you.

[00:27] So I think one of the most viable beliefs because in terms of building on success, in my opinion,

[00:33] first you need to develop skills, then you need to develop character traits to make sure

[00:37] that you do those skills.

[00:38] And then you have to make sure that your beliefs are correct that you can open up the world.

[00:42] But the beliefs are kind of imbued throughout the entire process because if you don't believe

[00:45] you're going to acquire skill, you never will.

[00:47] If you don't believe you're going to have a character trait you never will.

[00:50] And so I was having a conversation with a friend of mine who's looking to switch career paths

[00:58] to try to figure out she wasn't making as much money as she wanted to make.

[01:02] And the issue that she was dealing with, she just doesn't have a value on a skill set.

[01:07] And she's like, I want to make this much money and I was like, well, you're never going

[01:09] to do that, doing what you're doing.

[01:12] And I was like, have you considered learning how to sell?

[01:14] Right?

[01:15] Because if you sell, you have a far, if you still have the desire for security, but if you know

[01:18] how to sell, you can pretty much write your own paycheck if you know where to look.

[01:23] And she was like, I'm not good at sales.

[01:26] I'm not a sales person.

[01:27] And I was like, well, how many hours of sales training have you gone through?

[01:30] She was like, no, no.

[01:32] And I was like, well, then why would it be reasonable for you to be good at sales?

[01:35] Right?

[01:36] That doesn't make any sense.

[01:38] Of course you're not good at sales.

[01:39] Like you haven't done it.

[01:40] Right?

[01:41] Well, it's the same thing.

[01:42] Well, I'm not a very marketing type person.

[01:44] And I was like, well, how many courses have you gone through?

[01:46] How many hours a day do you spend studying?

[01:48] Marketing?

[01:49] Well, you know, none.

[01:50] Well, then why is it reasonable that you're like, why would it?

[01:54] It's it would be unreasonable for you to be good at the skill given the amount of investment

[01:57] you've made.

[01:58] Right?

[01:59] And so it's this recurring thing that I've seen over and over and over again.

[02:03] And it also, it presents itself in different ways.

[02:05] Like, I'll speak at some event or something.

[02:07] And I'll start getting into very basic math about business.

[02:11] It's just business math.

[02:12] Like, how much does cost your car cost?

[02:13] How much was the lifetime value?

[02:14] Things like that.

[02:16] And I just can see people starting to freak out because they're like, I'm not good at math.

[02:21] And I have to lean back and are lean, you know, pressure onto that belief because one,

[02:25] that's a belief that literally never serve you.

[02:27] It's like saying, like, I hate employees.

[02:29] It's like, well, good luck owning a business that you want to grow to any appreciable scale,

[02:34] right?

[02:35] But with the math example, most, you can, you can, you can massively succeed in business,

[02:42] knowing only like, not even algebra, just basic multiplication, subtraction, division.

[02:48] Like, if you just know how to do that, that's all you need to do.

[02:50] And just about everyone knows how to do those things.

[02:53] And at the very least, it has a calculator who can do multiplication, division,

[02:57] at addition and subtraction.

[02:58] That's it.

[02:59] That's all you literally need.

[03:00] And thing is, is that people mistake that they are bad at math when in reality,

[03:07] they do not understand the concepts that create the math, right?

[03:12] They're cost per acquisition, right?

[03:15] Okay, that's a math statement, just expressed in words.

[03:18] And so, everyone gets tripped up and then they say, I'm bad at math when in reality,

[03:22] they just don't understand the term.

[03:25] And by doing that, they inherently limit themselves from learning because they have this

[03:28] checkbox in their head that as soon as it gets difficult, they say, ah, I'm bad at this.

[03:33] I am bad at this.

[03:34] I identify with being poor at this thing and therefore will never succeed at this thing

[03:40] that you requirement for being successful.

[03:43] And so, I think that for me, one of the cornerstone beliefs that has helped me,

[03:51] a tremendous amount, I just want to share it with you is that if someone can, therefore,

[03:57] I can.

[03:58] And sure, is that necessarily mean that you're going to go to the go to Mars?

[04:03] It's like, no one's ever done that before.

[04:05] I think that's the next level belief.

[04:06] No one's ever done it and I'm going to be the first, right?

[04:09] But I think if you can at least just believe that if someone has done it, it is therefore

[04:13] possible and therefore I can do it too, if I do the same things.

[04:17] And the nice thing about actions is that they are agnostic to your level of deservingness

[04:22] and skill.

[04:24] What I mean by that is, if you spend an hour a day practicing sales over a year, you will

[04:30] likely be in the top 10% 5% 2% of people because most people do nothing.

[04:38] Most people do absolutely nothing except for deal with their emotions on a regular basis

[04:44] and procrastinate and give themselves reason for why they are not successful besides the obvious

[04:48] one, which is that it is not reasonable that they would be successful giving the amount

[04:52] of time and effort they have put in to achieving.

[04:55] And so, I, the only reason for this is because I had that conversation, I spoke to the master

[05:02] member of the girl talked about not understanding the math and there is just so many repeated

[05:09] events like this where it is like, can you ask yourself with reason, would it be reasonable

[05:15] for me to be good at the skill given the investment I have made?

[05:18] And as a core layer, as an antithesis to that example, I have got an 18 year old kid who

[05:24] lives across the street for me and I sort of send my mentor him, he is a good kid, he works

[05:30] super hard, a lot of hustle and the thing is that he is too young to know that he can't

[05:34] do things yet.

[05:36] And what that does is it makes him incredibly dangerous because he hasn't been slapped in

[05:40] the face by the world yet and so he believes that he can accomplish anything.

[05:43] He has no reason to think otherwise and so I have been actively trying to speak that

[05:48] into him and now he is wholesaling real estate right now is 18 years old, right?

[05:54] I love this, right?

[05:55] And how did he do it?

[05:56] He watched YouTube videos for free, right?

[05:58] And then he picked up cold calling because I was like this is a book you need to read

[06:01] for cold calling and so he just started cold calling based on what the YouTube videos said

[06:05] off of a free list that he found on the internet and he closes first deal as 18 year old.

[06:10] And so does he have any her in skill?

[06:12] No, but I did was I prepared him mentally by saying like you are going to suck at this

[06:17] for a very, very long time and eventually after doing it so many times it will be unreasoned

[06:22] for you to suck and at that point you will be good.

[06:25] And so I think if we can all approach the skills that we feel like we are deficient in

[06:30] with that kind of concept of course I am going to suck.

[06:33] It would not be reasonable for me to be good.

[06:35] But if I do these actions it would over time be unreasonable for me to be bad at these things

[06:40] and I think by doing that you unlock a different ability to learn and by extension grow.

[06:47] And so anyways I hope you find this valuable.

[06:49] It's just it's a belief set that I find repeated especially in people who are smaller business owners who are

[06:56] getting started etc.

[06:57] And it drives me nuts because it's just saying that you can't do something before you even

[07:01] started and that's why people spend so long in the beginner stages because they they inherently

[07:07] dispel away their ability to learning get better because I'm not good at that.

[07:13] Well obviously you're not good at that you have not done it.

[07:16] And so anyways I hope you find this valuable.

[07:19] I hope you share it or tag in employee who you feel like you need to invest in a skill and

[07:25] as a freight of it or somebody who is bad at math but has never tried or learned it.

[07:30] You know you're bad at drawing and just to bring this home I've said this before but I'll say it again.

[07:36] Many of you are I here regularly that people consider me to be good at math right.

[07:42] Until I was 23 I thought I was horrible at math.

[07:46] Like I just like I need you to understand this.

[07:48] Like I believed I was horrible at math.

[07:52] And so what I did was I stopped allowing myself to use a calculator and said I had to do all the math in my head.

[08:00] And what ended up happening is I got a lot of stuff wrong for a long time but over time I started to get

[08:05] better at math because I did everything in my head and now people are like dude you're so good at doing

[08:09] mental math but I spend every day not using a calculator for almost every calculation I make so that

[08:16] I can get better. And now it seems really cool because I can do a lot of math in my head pretty quickly.

[08:22] But I can't like I was bad. Like I literally cheated my entire way through high school

[08:28] in math class just to just to get by. I told myself I was bad at math.

[08:33] Unlike the SAT and the G-Man there was your this section I was most afraid of right

[08:38] and I studied so much harder on the math for the G-Man and I ended up doing

[08:44] you know hitting 99% high on it but I didn't but that was because I did 16 phone books of problems

[08:51] over four months I spent four hours a day for four months I was like I will do so much work that would be

[08:56] unreasonable for me to not be good at this. And so I say that just because like I feel like so many of us just limit ourselves

[09:03] when you just like have to try. And so anyways I love you all I'll give an amazing day. I hope that

[09:09] if there's something that you want to acquire from a skill standpoint that you allow yourself

[09:14] to be reasonably bad until a point where it would be unreasonable for you to be at given the amount of time

[09:19] and effort you put into it. So I'll still have keeping awesome and I'll catch you soon. Bye!

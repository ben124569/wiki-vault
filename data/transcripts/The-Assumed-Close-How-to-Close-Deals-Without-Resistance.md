[00:00] So when I was at my own gym back in the day,

[00:04] probably eight years ago, I was really struggling, right?

[00:07] And I was traveling to come back home or something.

[00:10] And during a layover, I saw the sky that I used to go to college with.

[00:13] And he, he was, I didn't think this guy was like that much.

[00:16] More than me and like, definitely like I was in some class

[00:19] where I was like, I don't think this guy's that, right?

[00:21] And he sits down next to me and he says,

[00:23] he's like, oh, how's your gym?

[00:24] I heard you got a gym and I was like, oh, you know, it's going well.

[00:27] I was like trying to be cool.

[00:29] And he's like, yeah, I've got this supplement store.

[00:31] And I was like, oh, that's awesome.

[00:33] I mean, so I've got two locations down.

[00:34] I was like, oh, well, fancy you.

[00:37] And I said, well, what do you guys do like a month?

[00:39] He says, I don't know, we do like 78,000 a month.

[00:42] And I was like, in supplements, he was like, yeah.

[00:46] And at that moment, it was like my mind broke.

[00:49] I was like, if this guy can do this, I'm going to find a way.

[00:52] Like I was like, I've got this whole gym full of people.

[00:54] And I don't saw them supplements.

[00:56] And so when I came back, I was like 100% committed to selling supplements.

[00:59] I was like, I'm going to figure out how to do this.

[01:01] And every single client will walk into my facility.

[01:04] After I would sell them our service package, I was like, hey,

[01:06] buy these supplements, right?

[01:09] And they were like, no, I'm not going to.

[01:11] And then it felt horrible.

[01:13] And I literally just again and again and again,

[01:15] I just kept getting beat up.

[01:16] And I bought all this inventory after I talked to that guy.

[01:19] And so this cash is just sitting on my shelf.

[01:21] And I was like, I have to find a way to move this stuff.

[01:23] And so one day, I think I had 15 or 20 consultation sites.

[01:27] I sold a bunch of people into a new program that was starting.

[01:29] And I was doing all the one-on-one orientations.

[01:32] And I was probably like 15 orientations deep.

[01:33] And I just had it no after no after no after no.

[01:36] And finally, I was sitting down and this nice lady walked in.

[01:40] She had like a nice ring and a nice person.

[01:42] And I was like, okay, if I don't sell this woman,

[01:45] I'm going to kill myself.

[01:46] And so and she was like super upbeat.

[01:48] And anybody who's ever done sales, like you know when you see that person,

[01:50] you're like, I'm definitely closing this one.

[01:52] Like I have to close this one.

[01:53] Like this is how I pay my bills.

[01:55] And so she sits down.

[01:57] And I remember getting to the end of the presentation.

[01:59] And I just said, instead of my normal pitch around like high

[02:02] perjury and maintaining body mass and just a whole bunch of jargon

[02:06] that she would never even understand, I said, hey,

[02:08] so with the program I was like, do you want to do,

[02:10] you want chocolate or vanilla for your protein?

[02:13] And she was like, which one do you like?

[02:15] And I was like, chocolate.

[02:17] She was like, all right, I'll take one of those.

[02:18] And I was like, I didn't want to scare

[02:22] her away.

[02:23] So I was like, I've got for the pre-workout.

[02:26] Do you want to do Kiwi or strawberry?

[02:28] I like the Kiwi.

[02:30] She was like, okay, I'll do that one.

[02:31] And I didn't want to sell anymore because I was afraid

[02:33] that she would somehow back out.

[02:35] And so and I didn't want her to like make any other purchasing

[02:39] decision.

[02:39] So I said, do you want to use the car?

[02:40] Do you have a file?

[02:42] And she was like, yeah, that's fine.

[02:43] And then I took these off the shelf and I, and I slid them over her.

[02:47] And she grabbed them and she smiled and she walked out of the facility.

[02:52] And I made my first supplement sale.

[02:54] And I was like, holy shit.

[02:58] I didn't even talk at all about what these even did

[03:02] or how to take them or what the benefits were.

[03:04] I just simply asked her which one she wanted.

[03:07] And the Kiwi was, I didn't ask her, whether she wanted them.

[03:11] I asked her which one she wanted.

[03:14] And as soon as I realized that, that is when I was introduced

[03:18] to the assumed clothes.

[03:20] It is one of the strongest upsells in all of business.

[03:25] Like I can't tell you, whenever I hear someone,

[03:28] if there's every sales process that generates tons and tons of traffic

[03:32] and they're closing anywhere in the 80% plus range,

[03:35] I usually know that it's an upsell.

[03:38] And the beauty of an assumed clothes is that the prospect is choosing

[03:41] between two options that both are buying from you rather than weather

[03:45] or not they're going to purchase.

[03:47] And so the beauty is if you can construct your conversations

[03:49] in a way that makes the sales seamless and make it assumed

[03:53] that they're going to have this extra thing with your program,

[03:56] you can immediately upsell a big, big, big percentage of customers

[03:59] whereas maybe normally you might close one out of three or one out of four

[04:02] or if you're really good one out of two,

[04:04] of customers who are walking the door.

[04:05] With an assumed clothes as an upsell, you can sell nine out of ten,

[04:09] nine and a half out of ten of the people that you sit in front of.

[04:12] And you can close them at higher tickets at higher percentages.

[04:15] And part of the reason is because in an upsell opportunity,

[04:18] you're selling to a customer who already knows and trusts you.

[04:21] Right? And if you pair the fact that they already know and trust you,

[04:23] with the fact that you already have a purchase that's already happened,

[04:26] you have their information on file.

[04:28] And then you simply present them with an either or option that both include buying,

[04:33] you will typically get a huge percentage to take that option.

[04:37] So this assumed clothes rapidly transformed in business.

[04:41] I ended up making just as much of not more from the supplement sales

[04:44] and profit than I did from my actual facility.

[04:47] It became a staple in all the locations that I had.

[04:49] I was able to cover all of my advertising spends simply from the upsells.

[04:53] And so that took all of what used to be my service revenue and just turned that into profit

[04:57] because I could cover all my acquisition costs simply with the upsells.

[05:00] I taught this to all of the facilities that we had and they ultimately used that for selling prestige

[05:05] labs, which is the brand of something that we have that pays really, really high margins for gyms.

[05:10] And so that single experience for that lady, bless her soul, just said yes to the either or option

[05:17] is what significantly changed a huge part of my life.

[05:20] And so anyways, I hope you take something from that.

[05:23] I hope there's something you can look in terms of your sales process.

[05:25] And in terms of something you could upsell.

[05:27] It doesn't have to be a product, it can be a service.

[05:29] It could be, you know, it could obviously be any kind of retail stuff.

[05:31] Physical products is really easy because you already sold service.

[05:34] So next, that you want to think of what's the next natural thing that they're going to want to need?

[05:38] Or want or going to have to normally buy on their journey.

[05:41] And if you're like, I don't know how to find something like that.

[05:44] You just simply look at what the normal things that are customable buy in addition to your services

[05:48] as a result of the decision.

[05:50] You know, fitness is an easy one.

[05:51] People go buy clothing, fitness clothes, they buy shoes, they might buy some at home stuff,

[05:55] they might start downloading some apps, they might get different groceries,

[05:59] that's food or food prepping, food preparameterials, a crock pot.

[06:02] Like all of those things are things that would be accompanied then obviously supplements.

[06:06] And so a lot of times when a consumer makes a decision to work with you on a service side,

[06:09] there's other additional purchases that they're going to make.

[06:12] And if you can, if you can predict what those are, what you should know,

[06:16] and weave those into your sales process as an either-or decision,

[06:19] you will usually get a very big percentage to uptake.

[06:21] And a lot of times those upsells can be all profit for you,

[06:24] and even offset the entire cost of acquisition of getting into customers.

[06:28] So I can't even stress how impactful this was in my life.

[06:30] And so anyways, hope you've done that valuable.

[06:32] Hope that was cool.

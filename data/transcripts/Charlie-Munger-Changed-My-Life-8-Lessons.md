[00:00] Charlie Mucker was one of my greatest heroes and he just recently passed away at the age of 99

[00:06] month and a half away from training 100.

[00:14] He lives one of the most exceptional lives both in his personal success but I would say more so

[00:21] and how much he was willing to give back to others to help others along the way. And he embodied

[00:26] all of the traits that he has spoused in the many speeches and talks and shareholder meetings

[00:33] that he had over his 99 year career. And I want to share some of my personal biggest takeaways

[00:40] from having Charlie Mucker as a hero that don't even come close to the many gems of wisdom

[00:45] he shared but are some of the ones that I use on a regular basis. So right off the bat the first and

[00:50] biggest one is his process of inverted thinking. Now he purportedly claims that he's not the first

[00:55] person to say this Einstein always said invert always invert and so Charlie was a huge history buff

[01:01] and loved living in the past and reading autobiographies of the smartest people

[01:07] who'd ever walked the earth and a lot of his thinking processes were formulated

[01:10] from seeing how those people thought and he passed it along to people like you and me. And inverted

[01:15] thinking is simply taking a very hard problem. So if you said hey I want to grow my business

[01:21] trying to grow a business is in some ways more complex and difficult than saying if I were to

[01:26] destroy my business and his few moves is possible what would I do. And so then thinking well if I wanted

[01:31] to absolutely destroy my business I would do this first and then I would do this second and then I would

[01:35] do this third and then I would do this fourth and you create that list and all of a sudden what's

[01:39] interesting about it is that we have such a stronger ability to find threats and negatives in our

[01:45] environment than we do positives. And so it's like if I want to ask you hey tell me 10 things you're

[01:50] like um well right now if I said tell me 10 things tell me about 10 problems you have in your

[01:55] life you could probably rattle off 100 without breaking a sweat it's because we're way more

[02:00] wired to find threats in the environment than find good things. Now using that engine we apply it

[02:06] to a business or personal setting or any complex problem and say okay I'm going to find all the ways

[02:12] them in a strong business and then you invert it. And so if for me to destroy my business I would

[02:17] make sure that I would never let anyone know about my stuff okay well then what would I do to

[02:21] invert that? I would let as many people assume we possible know about my stuff. If I wanted to

[02:24] destroy my business I would make sure that we had a terrible product so that anybody who bought it would

[02:29] immediately think it was awful and tell all their friends that it sucked and leave bad reviews.

[02:33] Okay so it's the opposite of that. I want to have something that's exceptional that as soon

[02:37] as people get it they love it they tell the friends how great it is and then they leave positive reviews.

[02:41] Right and you can go down the list and start thinking okay if I wanted this negative thing to happen

[02:45] what would I do? You say that and then you invert it and for whatever reason you get completely

[02:49] different answers then you would try to think of it in the positive and I have done this I'd

[02:54] stand did it, mungered it there. Way more successful than I am in many ways and so it is a process

[02:58] that I've used in so many different parts of my life. Charlie said the death of most people is

[03:03] liquor is the three else liquor leverage and ladies. And so I'm not saying you avoid liquor

[03:11] ladies and leverage but to some degree that's pretty much what they did. They never took on

[03:16] excessive debt beyond what they could very reasonably cover. They they didn't fallander like obviously

[03:22] warrant had two wives he had his own setup but they weren't running through many many women and

[03:27] Charlie was pretty adamant about this he said I've never seen somebody whose life was better

[03:31] by including drugs and alcohol on them. Next thing I got from Charlie is his absolute obsession with

[03:36] simplicity and his importance of complexity and things that seemed too complicated. Charlie's most common

[03:43] response to deals was too hard and I think that that shows so much humility in how he approached

[03:50] he's one of the greatest investors of all time and still the majority of deals that came in and he

[03:54] was brilliant. He would just say too hard and so to me it's not like obviously he could think about it

[04:00] harder and figure it out or he probably did already know what it was but it just showed his absolute

[04:07] commitment to simplicity and I think Warren was quoted by saying we want to have businesses that are

[04:13] so wonderful that an idiot could run it and then have wonderful people run it instead and I think

[04:18] about that a lot with the businesses that we want to invest in and even the business models that we

[04:21] choose to pursue because oftentimes you have strategic decisions you need to make in your business

[04:25] you're like okay well there's this slightly more complicated thing or this simple thing which

[04:29] one should I do well oftentimes if it's simpler at scale it becomes complex and complexity at

[04:34] scale becomes impossible and so he takes the path of least resistance when it comes to some of these

[04:39] decisions and so I guess Charlie gave me a lot of permission to just say too tough too hard for me

[04:47] and I think a lot of times letting yourself off saving all that mental energy of trying to make

[04:50] an impossible or complex task work or I'm just saying I'm opting out I'm going to I'm going to

[04:55] fall the easy path because at the end of the day we're the ones who choose how hard we want our

[04:59] lives to be and so he's like yeah well if it's my choice then I just choose the easy life if

[05:03] the hard way to make money easy way to make money you could choose either one then why would you

[05:06] not choose the easy one the next thing I learned from Draw a concept that I remember as unique

[05:10] expensive sticky air managed by an owner and so basically that was their breakdown of the perfect

[05:16] business so unique in that it has a brand or something unique about it that makes it difficult for

[05:20] other people to copy this is when they talk about a competitive mode and so brand being one of the

[05:25] most obvious ones that you can use unique expensive so expensive and air actually are paired

[05:31] together which is you want something that you can buy for penny and sell for a dollar not buy for

[05:35] 90 cents and sell for a dollar right you want to have a lot of margin in whatever it is that you sell

[05:40] so that you can make more gross profits so that you can reinvest in the business and or take

[05:45] distributions as an owner so the sticky part is getting something that people will buy again and again

[05:51] and again and again and so that's both recurring and also reoccurring and so if you look at their

[05:55] portfolio they have recurring businesses like insurance but they also have reoccurring businesses

[05:59] like Coca Cola so you probably have bought Coca Cola products no longer are unknowingly and you

[06:03] probably never thought that you're on a Coca Cola subscription but every time you buy a power raid

[06:08] or you get a sprite or you go to the gas station you grab a drink or you go to a restaurant and you

[06:12] ask for a diet coke when you're there all of those even though they are reoccurring to you they are

[06:17] recurring to the parent company because that restaurant of that gas station regularly buys the same amount of

[06:23] coke even though you're not the one who's a quote on the subscription and the farther up the

[06:27] distribution chain you go the more reliable those purchases become and so they both wanted unique

[06:33] things that no one else could copy that you could charge a lot of money for that don't cost a lot

[06:38] and the airpiece is also low capital expenditure that you don't have to keep pouring money back

[06:42] into the business in order to keep it competitive sticky is that you want people to love the

[06:45] products such that they want to keep buying it again and again and so there's the actual economics

[06:49] of the business the second part of the business was who's running it right they said they want

[06:53] a business that's so wonderful that an idiot couldn't ruin it and then hire a wonderful person

[06:58] to run it and so when they talk about wonderful people they've I piece these pieces together from

[07:02] the the talks that both of them have given but it's that they want someone who acts like an owner

[07:06] they want them to behave as though 100% of their net worth is in the business that they're

[07:11] invested in and they cannot sell a stock ever and so when you get someone to think in that

[07:15] in that way then you get someone who is going to make ultimately very long term decisions that's

[07:19] the only thing they're actually indexing for by setting the incentives in that way you have to

[07:23] imagine all of your net worth is in the one stock that you're running of the company and you can

[07:27] never sell it now what do you do as your decision making and that's the right decision for the business

[07:31] and so I think one of the other things that Charlie's been so good at is he just knows what

[07:35] enough is enough he said I don't need the last dollar and I'm roughly paraphrasing there but basically

[07:40] he believed that deal should are either good and obvious or bad and obvious so you shouldn't

[07:46] need an excel sheet to figure out if you're going to make money it should be clear that you're

[07:50] going to make money on the deal and so he didn't need to beg borrow and steal and negotiate and

[07:55] chisel away the other person slice of the pie to get a few more percentage points he said he

[07:59] didn't make a lot of money or I'm not and so he was willing to leave meet on the bone

[08:04] or some room for other people at the table so that one other people could make money but I think

[08:08] the long-term thing is that those people don't want to do deals with him again because imagine if you have

[08:12] if you're always known as a super tough negotiator that doesn't leave anything for anybody

[08:16] else it's like you might get that one deal but no one's going to call you first you're always going

[08:19] to be called as a last resort rather than the first person they call and the amount of benefit you

[08:23] get from being everyone's first call rather than their last call probably can't be accounted for

[08:28] for an entire lifetime compounded with that kind of reputation so another one this is a big one

[08:33] that I learned from Charlie it was actually the importance of brand and so if you look at

[08:36] their most recent and if you think about them as investors in my opinion they only got better

[08:40] because your discernment as a decision maker just only improves with time as long as your

[08:44] mental faculties that they're in Charlie has shown I mean until the day he died that he had

[08:48] all of his mental faculties he did the sureholder meeting was still just smart as a whip

[08:52] and there for six hours answering questions and putting people at their place we don't seem to get that

[08:57] point you have any idea why Charlie if people weren't so often wrong we wouldn't be so rich

[09:04] and if you look at their largest most recent investment it's been Apple and so right now over

[09:10] half of at least the last time I checked half of Berkshire Hathaway is just Apple.

[09:16] Half huge why were they willing to buy a technology company when they normally didn't buy

[09:21] a technology of raw is because they saw the brand of Apple as the big strategic mode they saw that

[09:29] Apple could keep creating products and they had such a little audience of people who would just buy

[09:33] anything that they put out that they felt the likely that this company would be able to charge

[09:37] above average prices for average products for the extended for the foreseeable future was high

[09:43] and so they were willing to bet a huge amount of money on that company and they did and they were

[09:49] right yet again and so seeing that the companies they buy really are brands you know Ben Bridges

[09:56] Jewelers you look at things about seas candies think about dairy queen you think about

[09:59] guy co these are all companies that are wholly owned by Berkshire Hathaway and they were willing to buy

[10:07] those companies because they saw that they had a strategic mode and it wasn't because they had

[10:11] some novel business thing it was because of the brands that those companies they built and when I saw

[10:16] that them as investors and me as a business owner in different hats both saw the importance of brand

[10:22] to me was very confirming on my investment now and trying to build a brand that I am so this is a big one

[10:28] uh Charlie talked about living within your means a lot and it's such an obvious thing but

[10:34] if you had all the rules of money written in order you could follow just rule number one and

[10:40] never need money ever again which is if you always spend less than you earn you will literally never

[10:46] need money you wouldn't even need your savings because you would always spend less than you

[10:51] so you would never lack for money it's rule number one two three four five six seven eight nine

[10:56] ten because like you can't even do investing work rule number one is don't lose money rule number two

[11:02] is don't forget rule number one we couldn't do that unless you spent less than you earned

[11:07] and so like rule zero is spend less than you earn and what's crazy is that so many people are

[11:12] trying to find advance and complicated trading and investing tactics when they haven't even mastered

[11:18] bouncing their budget and so he had such such an emphasis on doing the fundamentals that I think

[11:26] just his his repeated emphasis of that and just now paired with my own experience having grown

[11:33] relatively large companies I mean over the last three years we've added a hundred million in revenue

[11:38] organically from the companies we have in the portfolio so I feel relatively confident talking about it

[11:43] um we don't do anything complicated ever all we do is continually trying to simplify the business

[11:50] and do the fundamentals everywhere all the time that's it because doing the fundamentals everywhere

[11:56] all the time is already as complicated as you can imagine doing anything beyond that

[12:02] doesn't even happen in reality and so if you do the fundamentals everywhere all the time you become

[12:09] an advanced business owner yeah we warn and and Charlie both talk about learning from the

[12:14] mistakes of others so the next point that I would say I'd grab from him and warn was learning

[12:18] from the mistakes of others you know they say a dumb person makes their own mistake and then repeats

[12:23] it a smart person learns from their mistakes a wise person learns from them mistakes of others and so

[12:28] you can live multiple lifetimes of lessons simply by allowing other people to share their lessons

[12:34] and their mistakes with you and then taking the lesson without the scar and so honestly that's why

[12:39] I make the I mean this channel is that I can transfer as many of the scars rather the lessons that I got

[12:44] without the scars to everyone in the imagination but I feel like I've learned so many of those lessons

[12:49] from Uncle Charlie in Uncle Warren that I've just been able to apply into a modern day business environment

[12:57] just in my own life I think one of the one of the most understated things that I learned from Charlie was

[13:04] that despite being one of the best investors of all time I think the thing that made him

[13:09] one of the best isn't necessarily his financial return there are other investors who have achieved

[13:13] higher returns than he and Warren have now obviously from absolute returns because they've been doing it

[13:18] for so long they have one of the biggest portfolios of all time but Charlie's network was only a

[13:23] few billion dollars and I say only as though it's not a lot of money of course it was but he could have

[13:27] made a lot more if he so chose to but he said it over and over again that he never wanted to make money

[13:32] he just desperately wanted to be independent he said he just overshot and I think about that a lot

[13:38] when it comes to what things I'm optimizing for because it's so easy to get caught in the race of more

[13:45] I've just always wanted more and never having enough and I think probably the single greatest thing

[13:49] that I would say I'm sure from Charlie was that he knew what enough was enough and that he had

[13:53] accomplished his objective which was to be free and independent and to just do whatever he wanted

[13:58] whenever he wanted with whom every moment and I think that in a lot of ways the way he lived was

[14:05] an ideal life he he spent his time doing the thing that he was exceptional at with the person

[14:14] that he probably cared the most about in the world just Warren is closest friend they never argued

[14:18] once in their entire relationship per mind or standing and what better of a life could you ask for

[14:23] and so I think when I think about his life I see that as such a wonderful model to go after

[14:28] and I will be eternally grateful for the contribution that he had unknowingly to my life

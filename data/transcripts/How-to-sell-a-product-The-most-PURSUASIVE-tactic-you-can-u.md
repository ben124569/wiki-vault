[00:00] In this video, I want to talk to you about a time where I bombed, completely bombed,

[00:04] a stage presentation, and one of the most important lessons that I've learned from it

[00:08] that has made me a lot of money since then, and has protected my reputation and gotten me a lot of goodwill.

[00:15] So if you've ever like not known what to do or what to offer people or hey should I try and use this as an

[00:21] opportunity to build goodwill or forge a relationship or should I try and, you know, sell something or get a margin on this.

[00:27] I want to tell you a couple different stories that kind of all illustrate the same point that I've learned

[00:31] over the last few years. All right, and so one of my favorite kind of like bullets on this that you can

[00:36] you can write or down or is no half measures, right? Either sell or don't sell, but don't be in between.

[00:45] And so the first time that this kind of happened for me was, I was asked to speak at this kind of high-level

[00:52] mastermind, which happens relatively frequently. But this one in particular was a, I was a fitness-related one.

[00:58] And for me, when I have presentation stuff, I usually spend a long time preparing, sometimes I'll make a

[01:03] product, actually that it was the only time made a product. But I spend a long time on the presentation,

[01:08] so it's usually a big deal for me to say yes because it's like I'm going to have to, I'm going to have to do a lot of work on my side.

[01:13] And so anyways, this presentation in this pitch that I had made for a product that we had made specifically for this audience,

[01:21] and when I got there, they had given me a three-hour time slot, which is insane. And I think part of that was because

[01:28] they just wanted to have me talk as long as possible, you know, for their audience because they thought it would be valuable.

[01:33] And so for whatever reason I agreed, and the thing is, is like you can't pitch for three hours, maybe you can,

[01:38] but you can't straight pitch for three hours. And so what I decided to do is just provide, you know, a lot of value,

[01:43] you know, near the end after two and a half hours, I was like, I'll just kind of mention what we have going on, right?

[01:49] And so I get up there first off, the audience size is one third of what was what I was told.

[01:55] So I was like, okay, that's a little bit different and disheartening. I go and I, you know, piece by piece,

[02:00] I'm doing Q&A with the audience, all the kind of stuff, right? And so as we transition,

[02:05] or as we, as I transition to the pitch part, right? I, I pull up the slide deck that's normally, you know,

[02:12] 90 minutes slide presentation with a pitch and an offer and everything. And I went through it and I was like,

[02:18] yeah, yeah, we talked about this. And I'm going through the slides, right? Like, like, super fast, just being like,

[02:24] yep, and this, you guys don't need me to tell you the story right? You should understand this, boom, boom,

[02:28] and then at the very end, I basically make the pitch, right? Without any kind of pre frame and I go through it,

[02:34] just like really fast and kind of half-assed. And I bombed, it was horrendous. It was horrible.

[02:43] Because I had so much speaking time, they didn't take me off stage because I still had like time left.

[02:48] And so I'm sitting there on stage, having me the offer, no one's moved. And then people were,

[02:53] and then all of a sudden, hand-storiesing from the audience with, with questions. And I had never

[02:59] set, uh, sold anything that was cheap in my life. So this was a $2,000 thing. It was literally the

[03:04] first time my entire life at personal anything below, 16,000, which was, you know, for,

[03:10] for, into the fitness space, right? I thought this was like a no-brainer. It's too grand.

[03:14] You don't even mean just buy it and then make a ton more money because it's, it's stupid, right?

[03:19] I started having people be like, hey, can I, can I do a payment plan on the $2,000? I remember,

[03:24] I remember, you were like, if you need a payment plan, then, uh, don't buy it. And next,

[03:28] question, and someone's like, I feel like, um, you know, the supplements that you have are against my,

[03:35] my goodwill because we only, I only promote vegan things. And I was like, cool, then don't buy it.

[03:39] And this is how the questions start unrolly. Like, this vibe, this talent, right?

[03:43] And you could just watch the plane just going towards the ground on fire, burning, right?

[03:49] I do this for like 30 more minutes, all right? Of Q and A, of me just getting increasingly annoyed,

[03:55] because A, there's only like 30 people there, which there were supposed to be a lot more than that.

[03:59] Anyways, and so I remember the feeling I had afterwards, which was just like anger and embarrassment,

[04:06] and just like, you know, humiliate all of those, you know, at once. And mind you, like, at the time,

[04:12] and this is then, right? We were doing about 4 million a month, all right? And so when,

[04:16] I had so people were like, well, how do we know it's gonna, like, you know, work for,

[04:19] it's a fitness, I was like, I have 4,000 freaking locations here. Like, that used this licensing model.

[04:25] I paired it down just for you guys so that you can use the materials at one eighth of price.

[04:30] This is not a discussion, right? So anyways, I remember sitting there in the pain of the moment,

[04:36] in the humiliation, I was like, what am I gonna learn from this? Which may be in and of itself something

[04:40] that you might be able to take with you. But like, whenever you have those like super emotional moments, right?

[04:45] I know from my conversations with Dr. Cassie that when you have extreme emotions, you're actually

[04:50] in hyper-learning mode. PTSD is where you're basically, you turn your brain on and it goes into

[04:55] hyper-learning mode because there's trauma that is going around you, right? And, you know, there's,

[05:00] it's a traumatic experience, which just means super-hyped emotions. And so what happens is your,

[05:04] is your brain says, learn from this, right? And then it starts ingraining these things so that when

[05:08] you hear a lot of noises, then you get amped, and then it's that, right? And so it's the same kind of thing.

[05:12] So if you have these emotional moments, this is for me, this is what I do. It's I try and think, like,

[05:16] what am I going to try and ingrain in my brain right now because I have an opportunity to hyper-learn

[05:20] something in these moments. And so the lesson I learned, and I'll tell you another story in a second

[05:25] that really drove this home, no half measures, either pitch or don't pitch. All right? So if you go

[05:31] into a business meeting or you go to a conference or you go to a whatever, right? Either ask hard

[05:37] or do not ask it all. There is no half-assed asking, all right? And this is so lesson that I have

[05:43] learned hard. I actually had one of my, one of my execs he ended up pitch-exes is, you know, now that we've

[05:49] moved ourselves out of that business and now we're just on top of it. One of the execs in my gym business,

[05:54] he have pitched something to our audience. He like half pitches like you guys don't need me to do

[05:58] the scarcity thing, right? You guys don't need me to do these guarantees, right? You don't need me to do these,

[06:02] actually what these bonuses, right? And I was like, what are you doing? I remember because the

[06:06] pit, I was like, that is how you pitch. You're saying that they don't need all the things that

[06:08] persuade them. He was like, well, they know because we teach them how to do this stuff and I was like,

[06:11] yeah, but like, people still need it to make decisions. And so he bombed that and he learned the

[06:17] lesson himself. So my goal is that you don't have to bomb it to learn the lesson, right? And so let me

[06:22] tell you the upside of this. Here's the flip side, right? So I talked about just now how you can,

[06:27] how like, no half measures, either pitch or don't pitch, right? Don't go in the middle.

[06:32] I think one of the, one of the things that's difficult for entrepreneurs is to know when to make the

[06:36] ask, right? So it's like, okay, well, if I'm either going all in or all out, well, then how do I

[06:40] know when to do which, right? And I would say that most times I have been better served in my life

[06:48] by holding back my ask. And what I mean by that, and this is like a super life action for those

[06:53] viewers who are who are persevering and focused on what I'm saying right now, then take this in,

[06:59] if you get to a point of goodwill, if you keep giving and keep giving and keep giving, you don't

[07:05] need to ask ever, you'll just get. So there's the commonly, you know, told like, you know,

[07:12] jab, jab, jab, right, hug, right, give, give, ask, right? But I would, I would postually that there is

[07:18] another one that is even more powerful, which is give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give,

[07:25] give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give, right? Is that people will just

[07:30] start handing things to you because humans are reciprocal in nature? They believe that if they

[07:35] are getting something at a certain point, they must reciprocate somehow, which is why the

[07:39] spammers who copy my name on this channel do so well with my channel because I don't ask for anything

[07:44] from imagination so by the way, just another disclaimer, I will not DM you or put you on WhatsApp

[07:50] and ask you for cap fare or ask you to buy something, everything that I have is free here. So

[07:55] just FYI, just as a reminder to everybody. And a lot of the best things that I've had happen in my

[08:01] life have come from goodwill. And so I think the biggest difference between big business owners

[08:05] and small business owners is that they do not understand and apply the concept of goodwill.

[08:11] Right? And I'll do an entire thing on goodwill next time because it's a deep topic that I love

[08:14] talking about. But right now, in your business, you have the opportunity to provide things for your

[08:19] audience. And if you can continue to provide them and have the patience to wait for the ask,

[08:24] you can actually make significantly more money. All right? And so the thing is is, if you're going to

[08:30] make the ask, which means if you're going to withdraw from your relational capital, right?

[08:34] The goodwill that you have in your audience, if you're going to make the withdrawal,

[08:38] then ask and ask hard and mean it. It's not the time to make it a nickel here, a nickel there,

[08:44] a nickel there, right? It's so much better to just keep investing, keep over delivering. And then

[08:49] when you ask, make it known that you are asking. And that is one of the biggest lessons that I have

[08:54] learned over time in business for me is that it is so much better to give and keep giving and keep

[09:00] giving and oftentimes you will get. And if you pitch, which you, if like the idea is to ideally

[09:05] never even have to because you should be getting so much. But if you, if you must pitch, then pitch like

[09:10] you mean it, right? And don't have facet. So anyways, that was a story of my bombing. I hope you

[09:16] found some humor in that for my humiliation. Um, most of the nation, love you all. Uh, my name's

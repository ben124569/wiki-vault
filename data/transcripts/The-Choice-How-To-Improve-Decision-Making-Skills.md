[00:00] What's going on everyone? Last night I was speaking I was one of the speakers and clubhouse

[00:06] it's a new app. You can follow me there it's at Hormosi. But anyways I was one of the speakers at this app and

[00:14] They were asking questions like if you had to start a little over you know, what would you do?

[00:17] What's the biggest mistakes you've made and things like that?

[00:20] And one of the things that came up in my mind is one of the hardest things about being an entrepreneur

[00:25] which is the disconnect between

[00:27] between the right decision and the right outcome. And so let me explain. So if you've

[00:34] listened to any of my stuff I talk about repeating successful actions, right? If I'm going to

[00:36] work and keep doing it over and over again, right? The thing is is your decision-making process

[00:40] is ultimately the most valuable thing that you have, right? It's what makes you it's your picker,

[00:45] right? It makes you decide what, what way to go, who you're going to marry, what business

[00:49] opportunity you're going to pursue, how you're going to price, how you're going to start marketing,

[00:52] what you're going to learn first, who you're going to, you know, get mentoring from all of these things,

[00:55] who you're going to become friends with, like all of these are decisions, right? And you know,

[01:00] you can take the money away from a billionaire and then they can recreate it again, Elon Musk,

[01:04] you know, lost it and then gained all back, right? And so like the thing is is the decision-making

[01:10] is what ultimately fuels all these things. And the hardest part about entrepreneurship and really,

[01:17] I mean, I think almost life in general is that you can make the right decision and have the wrong outcome.

[01:22] And I think, and let me give you a couple examples of this. So for example, you may say, you know what,

[01:28] like I look, I listen to Warren Buffett, I think he's a good investor. And so he says, I wouldn't,

[01:32] I wouldn't touch Bitcoin, right? And I hear that, I'm like, man, well, you know, is a little bit more

[01:37] about it than I do, but his argument was simple. It is speculative, which means I'm buying it,

[01:42] not because it has intrinsic value, but only because I believe that someone else will buy it for more

[01:46] later, right? It's all it is. He only believes in investing in things that have intrinsic value

[01:51] and also produce, right? So they actually have production. So like a business you buy,

[01:57] you still own the business at the end and then it spits out production, which would be profit or

[02:00] crops or whatever, right? So that's the basic difference, right? And so the thing is is that

[02:07] you can make the right decision. So for example, I chose not to buy Bitcoin two years ago or whatever.

[02:13] And now the amount of money that it would have been worth is a lot more. Was the decision wrong?

[02:19] Or was it that the outcome did not match the quality of the decision? So let me explain, let me like

[02:25] unpack this. If you are going to change the way you make decisions, because a decision that you

[02:30] made in the past that was probably a good decision ended up bad, you have to apply the same decision

[02:37] making context or framework to everything else. All right, so let me explain. So if I say,

[02:44] I'm now going to be a speculator, right? I'm going to be someone who buys things with the hopes

[02:48] of selling them later for more, even though the thing itself does not matter. Right? If I choose

[02:54] to start making those types of decisions, then I have to think about all the other investments

[02:59] I would have made and lost money on as a result of that decision making framework. And the

[03:04] place that I heard this first was Ray Dahlio in principles, so he was one of the richest

[03:08] men in the world, investors as well. And he said, one of the hardest things is passing up on an

[03:13] opportunity and then seeing it, you know, do really, really well, right? He's like, and but the thing is

[03:19] is, I have to think to myself, if I were to use the decision making framework that would have made

[03:24] that deal a winner, then I have to apply that same framework to all of these other businesses or

[03:29] situations that would have been losers. And my net net of having that different decision making

[03:34] framework would ultimately cause me to lose. And so this has been one of the most powerful

[03:38] concepts for me as an entrepreneur because what it does is it allows me to separate the outcome

[03:44] from the quality decision. Why was it that I did these things, right? And I can't even tell you,

[03:49] like, so for example, you know, actually I won't give you that one. But like there are

[03:54] decisions that I made when I was younger, that ended up being, you know, poor later. But when I thought

[04:01] back about why I made the decision, I would make the same decision today. So it's not fair for me

[04:07] to say, well, I wouldn't have made the same call now. But you can't use the information that you

[04:12] have today to make the decision that you would have made in the past because then it means that

[04:16] you were a different person because you're not using the information that you have access to, right?

[04:20] And so claiming that this decision that I did in the past that didn't end up well, you know,

[04:25] working out in my favor was the wrong call. You can just be really poisonous and it may not be true.

[04:30] Now, if you make a mistake because you had poor calculations and you've repeat the same

[04:35] mistake over and over again, then you should consider looking at your decision making calculus and

[04:38] see if you need to tweak some things, right? But for me, this has been one of the hardest learned

[04:43] lessons and emotionally one of the most trying is looking at decisions I've made, looking at the

[04:50] outcome and being able to separate, was to say good decision independent of the outcome.

[04:55] And I'll wrap this up with just a quick example to show you. If you had a perfect baseball swing,

[04:59] right, you're just an amazing, you know, better, right? If someone gets up there and the best

[05:06] better in the world and you strike out, is it because they're swing as horrible as it because they

[05:11] don't have the right decision making about how they swing at pitches or how they pick the pitches?

[05:16] Probably not. It's probably really good, better, right? I just said these the best.

[05:20] But it still means he's going to strike out and it still means he's going to get out and hit

[05:23] pop flies and all that kind of stuff. But he's going to be an amazing batter, but 350 average,

[05:29] whatever, and still two out of three times he's going to strike out or basically knock it on

[05:33] base, get out. And so when I think about that, like you can be the best at this thing and still

[05:38] only be right a certain percentage of the time, right? And so rather than that batter, striking out

[05:43] once and saying, I need to change my swing and then getting back up there and striking out again

[05:47] and being like, I need to change my swing and always resetting the baseline instead being like,

[05:52] I understand that if I apply this swing to enough at bats quite literally, I will get the opportunity

[05:58] to knock it out of the park and me knocking out of the park on one of these right decisions will

[06:03] ultimately outweigh the negatives of the wrongs that I have done. Right? And so for me, obviously

[06:09] within the context of your own life, like I talked about decision making other videos, but you

[06:14] want to make sure that you never bet the farm and you don't put everything on black when you

[06:18] cannot afford to lose, right? Like, don't bet everything. But I mean, sometimes things get crazy,

[06:25] but for the most part, don't bet everything. The point being, just like a big ball player, you're

[06:30] going to have these decisions that you have to make and not changing a decision calculus, your decision

[06:34] maker, your picker every single time is going to ultimately allow you to judge the quality of your

[06:38] decisions based on these principles. And so that is one of the hardest things that I've had to learn

[06:43] and I hope that the illustration with baseball meets since to you. If it did drop a comment,

[06:47] otherwise, keep being awesome and I'll catch you guys next video. Bye!

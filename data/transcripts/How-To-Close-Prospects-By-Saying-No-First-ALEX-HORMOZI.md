[00:00] I want to give you a quick and tactical training.

[00:04] This is one of my favorite stories of all time from selling stuff.

[00:08] This comes from the bolts of Richard Swords and Manos Swords Furriers.

[00:14] There are fourth generation Furrier in Baltimore and they took over the entire market,

[00:20] really the larger Maryland Pennsylvania market, just simply doing the boring work and being

[00:25] better at the everyday things.

[00:27] So Richard Swords, unknowing Unbinous to him, was a mentor of mine in terms of,

[00:32] I just observed a lot of the things that he did in his business.

[00:35] I started doing Backup Napkin, Maffin, O17 or 18 and I was like,

[00:39] do this guy, can't help him.

[00:42] And he was, and I probably still is.

[00:45] And there was one, he's, I learned so many things from him.

[00:49] But one of them was getting people to say, no, to say yes.

[00:53] All right, and so this is a very, very real-world tactical tidbit that you can use to close sales.

[01:00] Now, there's a specific type of sale that this really applies to, which is a lot of times

[01:05] bolt on or up sales, right?

[01:08] And these up sales can be incredibly important to the business in terms of driving bottom-by-profit,

[01:13] liquidating acquisition costs.

[01:15] And so usually these are sales that are not complex sales.

[01:18] These are not necessarily core offer sales.

[01:21] These are sales within the finish row that might be attributed to supplement sales,

[01:25] or meal sales, or if you were in retail, it'd be like getting someone to buy a scarf with the outfit,

[01:30] or just anything along those lines, getting someone to buy our thoughts if you're in the physical therapy space,

[01:37] or if you're in the dental space, getting a buy a specific kind of extra brace or special toothpaste,

[01:42] or whatever, or if you're in the beauty space, you know, night serums that go with your service package,

[01:47] whatever it is, right?

[01:48] The point is, is that usually there's going to be, you know, one or multiple things you're going to want to go with your core offer,

[01:53] right?

[01:54] The reason that this little trick I learned from him is so powerful is that it closes like crazy.

[02:01] All right?

[02:02] So if you're used to having like 20, 30% of people take up sales, that is a normal amount where people take up sales.

[02:07] And the reason he gets 90% plus to take his up sales is because they don't know they're being sold.

[02:12] All right?

[02:13] And so here's the trick in your style works.

[02:14] And I mean, you can take this to the bank, like it works.

[02:18] Okay?

[02:19] And I'll give you the example that they used at manner.

[02:23] And so somebody who come in into every year if you bought a foot code, you would have to store it, right?

[02:28] And they mean they killed a known storage, but anyways, so people would come in.

[02:32] So basically they'd sell someone a car essentially because that's how much it, you know, for a pit is.

[02:36] So it's also going to car.

[02:37] And then every year they would maintain that kind of relationship by getting them to come back in and store the code during the summer,

[02:43] because it's not good to, you know, keep a really expensive fur in, you know, the heat for whatever, right?

[02:49] That's at least part of the pension.

[02:51] And so they, everybody brings their fur in to get stored in condition.

[02:55] So they brush them, you know, and I was one of the guys who was brushing them in the, for kind of a house and like spread these things down.

[03:01] It was my number work, but I got to learn a lot while I was there.

[03:04] And so, you know, we brush these codes.

[03:08] And so one of the, one of the things, one of the promotions you ran as it said,

[03:11] was get a free pair of fur ear muffs when you stole your code for winter.

[03:19] I'll show you a couple of summer season.

[03:21] And so tons of people would come in because they wanted these true real fur ear muffs by pregnant in.

[03:28] And so what it, what it, what it, a happening is, David has done would, the personal come in.

[03:34] And then say, I want to, I want to do this and can I get the, the fur, for ear muffs.

[03:38] And so he would show them the fur ear muffs. And then say, well, you're like, what we're going to do is store and condition your code.

[03:47] You don't want anything else to do you.

[03:49] And they would say, no, I don't want anything else, but the conditioning was an upset, right?

[03:53] And it's almost even the way I presented it to you.

[03:55] It's now it's like, well, you're going to store your condition code.

[03:57] But storing code versus storing and doing the brush down and doing the, the shampooing, if the code is obviously an extra service.

[04:05] But it immediately added a couple hundred bucks to every single code.

[04:09] And they were doing thousands of codes, right? And so any of them, the point is is that they would get people to just agree that they don't want anything else.

[04:19] Okay? So think about how you can use this strategy, right?

[04:22] There's, there's, there's many ways you can use it, but the something else is the easiest that I can ever see, right?

[04:28] So let's say you say, hey, like, this is what you're going to, this is what you need to take for this weight loss program, right?

[04:34] These are the four substance you need to take. Now you might have more supplements, right? And you're like, you don't want to buy anything else to you, right?

[04:40] And then they're going to automatically, a lot of times, like, you don't want to buy any more stuff to you.

[04:43] And then they're like, no, no, no, no, no, I don't want to get anything else, right?

[04:46] And by doing that, you automatically close the sale that you just recommend it, right?

[04:51] And you can do the same thing in a different way, which would be like, hey, you don't want to pay full reach out for that, right?

[04:59] And they're going to be like, no, no, no, no, no, it's like, cool, so you want me to send it with this discount to, you know, the address I have them find a little bit like, okay, yeah, yeah, let's do that, right?

[05:08] And so by doing that, you're getting them to say, yes, by saying, no, and the thing is, is people are so contrary and people always feel like they're being sold, that actually use that psychological, like, it's subconscious, like they can't even think, they're not even making the thought process, like they're agreeing, because they're so pre-programmed to try and not to buy things that they end up buying things.

[05:28] And so you use that psychological bias to your advantage. It's one of the most powerful techniques I've ever seen in sales.

[05:33] Most people get 20 to 30% uptake on their upsells.

[05:38] If you use an assumed close tactic like this, you can literally see 90% plus take rates on this, right?

[05:46] And so as to wrap up the story, when they give them the earmuffs at the, at the burger, they would.

[05:55] They would say, well, now that you have those, you're going to need it to store those in condition those as well, so that'll be, you know, an extra whatever.

[06:04] And so what ended up happening is that people would get the free, the free earmuffs, but you have to pay to get a store to conditions to cover the costs.

[06:12] So, it's just kind of hilarious because what ended up having to give it to them, they'd have it in their hand like, well, you still need to store it, because you just bought your code here, and you're not going to keep these out.

[06:21] So, to be, to be congruent with the story of needing a store to the code, they had to wrap it right underneath the jacket and then they would take both of them in the back.

[06:29] And so people would come in, they'd get the earmuffs, they'd hold onto them, and they'd put them right back on the quote, and they said,

[06:33] He don't want us to do anything else besides, you know, storing a condition in due.

[06:37] And they're like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[06:39] Like, okay, well, let's, we could that take care of.

[06:41] And then they'd expect the code real fast, but like, want to secure this button, it's kind of loose.

[06:44] Want us to, so this little seam here, they're like, oh, yeah, sure, you want anything else to do, right?

[06:48] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[07:18] no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[07:48] no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[00:00] The character traits that must be associated that you learn as you go, right?

[00:03] Because these character traits are things that have to happen in order for these skills to be consistently executed.

[00:11] And so it's first you develop the skills, right, at a proficient level.

[00:14] Then you dive deep on those skills so that you get better and better at them.

[00:19] And typically, that comes through consistent execution and repetition,

[00:22] which means that it takes the character traits of focus and determination and drive,

[00:29] right, and being able to be consistent and not go away and start looking at Chinese objects,

[00:36] looking at Chinese objects, looking at a new opportunity, looking at this other side,

[00:39] hustling you want to do, whatever it is, right?

[00:41] Because there's always new things and what's crazy about this is that the higher up you go,

[00:45] the more seductive the woman in the red dress looks like.

[00:48] And I'm saying that from Matrix, I'll tell you, I'll tell you every movie.

[00:52] The woman in the red dress, I'm using this as a parable or an individual for opportunity.

[00:58] And when you're starting out, the woman in the red dress always looks attractive.

[01:03] And the thing is, is that the higher up you go, the more of a ten-she-be comes.

[01:07] Now, if you're a girl, then a guy in a red suit would.

[01:10] I don't know, maybe that looks more like a pen said and forget about that.

[01:13] But whatever, you know, George Clooney or whoever your person is, whatever, you might point,

[01:17] is that like I thought that I was having discipline in saying,

[01:21] no, to a certain level opportunity when I was starting with James, right?

[01:25] And I had to develop that discipline. And then we started making a few million dollars a year.

[01:30] And I was like, okay, I need to develop a new level discipline because there's more things that

[01:34] I want to do that I have to not be able to do, right? One of the biggest successful things I did was

[01:38] not start the supplement company until year and a half after almost two years after Jim Lont started.

[01:43] All right, I had planned starting the supplement company at the same time as I started Jim Lont's original

[01:50] three and a half or years ago. Like they were at the same time I wanted to do both.

[01:55] And Laila, the angel that she is was like, no, that's stupid. Don't do that.

[02:01] And so she thankfully was like, you have to have to stay focused. And so because of that,

[02:07] we were going to have the explosive growth that we did. And then at the right time, we were going to

[02:09] both that on. Now, big, big, big picture. I don't know if I would have done it again. I still

[02:15] probably would have stayed even more focused on Jim Lont. If I could do it all over again. Now,

[02:21] we have it, you know, we write a check for $600,000 every single month to our Jim Lont's in terms of

[02:27] commission checks. So that's a real money that I can send back to the community and that's very

[02:30] fulfilling for me. And it solves the problem that I always had on a hemogen. So like there are

[02:35] reasons that I did it. And so like, history will tell what it was the right call or not. I can never

[02:43] live the life of what it would have been if I hadn't done it. But I think if I were going back

[02:47] in time knowing what I know, I might not have done it. But you never know. So I'm telling you,

[02:52] like, I've made these mistakes. You know what I mean? And the thing is is that that level of

[02:56] opportunity looked even more seducting or seducing or whatever the word is. When we had two years

[03:04] more of a distribution base compared to when we had at the beginning. And so I wasn't able to say no

[03:09] to her that opportunity later on as I wasn't beginning. And that was a deficiency in my skillset

[03:16] at the time. I character trait of staying focused. Right. And so like I'm saying all this if you're

[03:23] looking at it in terms of in verticals, the first step is filling the holes. And that's stacking

[03:27] all the skills together so you can get the first dollar to go over. And that's just becoming proficient.

[03:32] Not amazing. Just proficient. You don't have to be an expert at running traffic. You just need to

[03:36] be able to actually know how to run an ad. And the thing is is that most proficient skills only take

[03:41] like like not a lot of time. Like you can Google how to do X. And if you consume for like two

[03:47] hours of information, you'll probably be proficient. Most people just don't take those two hours to

[03:51] do it because that's uncomfortable and you're not good at. Right. So you consume the information and

[03:56] then you try. Right. And then you fail because you're not good at it. You learn and then just use

[04:00] those first initial tries. You learn more in your first 20 sales. Then you do in the first 20

[04:05] hours of learning about sales stuff. Right. You first time you actually step in the ring,

[04:09] you learn more about fighting than you do during all the time that you're practicing. Right. Because

[04:13] it's real. Right. So you're developing your stacking your skills and you're becoming proficient at it.

[04:18] Next step, you have to do repetition and being willing to get punched on the face over and over and

[04:23] over again. Right. So that you can deepen those skills. And that's what amplifies the skills that

[04:28] you have so that you can get to another level. Then as you get to another level, then your character

[04:33] trace is needed to be strong so you can stay the course. Right. Like the biggest thing in the book

[04:39] by Angela Duckworth called Grit, which is really interesting, is that the people who are most

[04:44] successful in life just stick with it. Like grit is stick to itness is what it is. So it's how

[04:50] likely are you to abandon a certain path to pursue another thing. Right. And the people in the

[04:56] beginning have very low stick with itness. Entrepreneurs, Shiny object, Shiny object, Shiny object,

[05:00] they're jumping from opportunity to opportunity and they never give any of the opportunities

[05:04] that chance to be successful. So one of the interesting things that maybe you can think about in

[05:08] terms of a quote, you can take with you is you can be successful anything you want just not everything

[05:15] you want. All right. That was a huge lesson for me. All right. I had a friend from high school who reached

[05:20] out who had a contracting business and a roofing business and they were flipping houses. It's

[05:25] three separate businesses and I was like dude like like what do you want to help with? He was like

[05:30] I don't know like what do you think I should do? And I was like pick one. He's like well we're making

[05:34] money and all three of them. And I was like cool pick one. Each one of those businesses can be a

[05:38] billion dollar business. You can be a billion dollar roofing company. You can be a billion dollar flipping

[05:42] homes company. You can be a billion dollar general contractor. There are examples of each of these things,

[05:46] right. But you just can't be a billion dollars in all of them. And so there's a fallacy that we

[05:51] tell ourselves as entrepreneurs, which is that if I do more things I will make more money when in fact

[05:55] I need to do fewer things to get to where I want to go. And the reason I can tell you that it's

[05:59] the truth is because you naturally think the other way and that's what most people think which is

[06:03] why most people aren't successful. Right. It's they can't focus because there's too many things. It's

[06:08] just so easy just add this one thing. You do this other thing and all of a sudden you're too

[06:11] spread thin. You're not focused on amplifying the things that you're doing to get better. You're not

[06:15] deepening the skills. You're spreading yourself through. Right. And so once you acquire the skill set

[06:20] once you become proficient, then you amplify the skills that you have by deepening them and in order

[06:24] to do for them you have to have the character traits of sticking with it, being patient, being focused,

[06:29] learning to say no, and doing things over and over again and accepting the fact that it may take

[06:34] years it will take years in order to become to break through the next level of proficiency because

[06:41] when you're developing a skill, let me give you an example to tie this as an analogy for fitness.

[06:48] The amount of effort that it takes to maintain muscle versus the amount of effort it takes to make

[06:54] muscle as you become more advanced dramatically increases and what's interesting is that there's this

[06:59] big area of no man's land between enough to maintain and enough to break through and create a new

[07:05] stimulus for growth. There's this huge area in the middle and most people just work out above

[07:10] minimum effective dose but below the threshold that it takes to adapt. All right. And so when we focus

[07:16] here, when I focus on trying to get soil and trying to gain more muscle, I try to go all the way

[07:20] to the other end to break my body in the point that it has to adapt and get better. Right? And so with

[07:25] the same thing with skill sets is that there's a minimum effective dose and then there's a whole

[07:30] bunch of area in between where people do stuff enough but not enough to get better but still like they

[07:34] could take the extra time allocated towards deepening a skill and going all in on it and really push

[07:41] that forward and really deepen it rather than just consistently maintaining where you're at. And you

[07:45] can know if you're maintaining where you're at because if you're level of income is stayed the same

[07:49] for period of years, that means your skill set has stayed the same and if your skill set has

[07:53] stayed the same, it's usually because you lack the character traits in order to deepen those skills

[07:57] to amplify the revenue and to amplify your skill sets so that you can make more. All right. So

[08:02] I hope this makes sense. This was like one of the many things that I'll probably talk about after

[08:06] this summit. So leveling up why we get stuck and it's because the things that you need to improve on

[08:13] are different are at the beginning it skills but then you have to change your lens and then after that

[08:18] it becomes traits, right? It becomes character traits and those are very different to level up,

[08:23] right? Because everyone just always assumes it's going to be linear the same way and that's why

[08:26] people get stuck is because the actual thing that you need to improve changes, right? Not just skills

[08:32] but the actual nature of the change itself changes, which is pretty cool and sometimes the skill

[08:38] itself is to not do other things, right? Sometimes the skill itself is maintaining the course and that is

[08:44] the skill. That is the thing that you need to do to get to the next level is to do less and it's

[08:50] remove constraints. So I hope that makes sense for you. I hope you enjoyed that. If you did like this

[08:54] and you're listening to the podcast, drop a comment, drop a like. If you think someone else will listen

[08:58] to tag your friends. Hope you have an amazing day and lots of love as always. Keep being great.

[00:00] A lot of literature and videos and blog posts talk about sitting goals and I mean

[00:06] I mean

[00:06] All what I'm gonna walk you through is our or step goal setting process and I promise you

[00:12] It's probably not what you have seen in the past from basically another company because I actually didn't take how we set goals from any business

[00:20] Books I actually took it from the science book

[00:21] Number one is what problem are we solving a lot of you realize you're not solving a problem at all

[00:26] Which means you probably don't need to do it. This is especially true the lower in the organization

[00:31] It goes because people who are lower down in the work tend to not be as connected to the overarching picture of the company

[00:36] Simple example most goals have to be chunked up to one of three things

[00:40] Number one. They're going to help us get more customers. Number two is that it's gonna help us make customers

[00:46] Worth more and number three

[00:47] It's gonna increase the enterprise value of the company if you can't articulate why the goal is going to do that

[00:53] Then you shouldn't do it. So number one pick what problem you're actually trying to solve

[00:58] Simple example if IT decreases the page load times on all of our sites

[01:03] We will get more leads we get more leads we get more customers. It's cetera if IT improves the sign-on process

[01:09] For customers to have access to something that will mean we have fewer customers churn which means we will make customers more valuable

[01:16] If you can't tie how you're department and the function that you have either gets us more customers

[01:21] Makes them worth more increase the enterprise value of the business means you don't understand your job

[01:25] And if you're the entrepreneur of the head of the department that you don't know how you're actually writing about it

[01:28] The business breaking that down is the first and most important part of goal setting if this process

[01:33] Actually makes you think that it means you're doing it right because if you can just knock out your goal is really really fast

[01:37] It probably means you haven't thought through them well number two

[01:41] We create I hypothesis and the reason for that is when you set a goal

[01:45] Usually it's like we want to do this thing, right?

[01:47] Well, you're not actually trying to do the thing you're hoping that something's going to happen if you do the thing

[01:52] We like to define both of those variables in the hypothesis for example if I wanted to have a sales goal

[01:57] It might say something like if I decreased the time to call leads from 30 minutes to five minutes

[02:02] We will get a higher percentage of leads to book calls that literally the hardest part of this whole thing is what is the hypothesis that you're trying to test?

[02:09] Because when we ever we actually do something the business we're not guaranteeing the outcome and we're not guaranteed from the business

[02:14] That it's going to create the result we want. I'm sure you've tried plenty of things that have been goals and it didn't result in the thing that you wanted

[02:20] Which is why you shouldn't state it as a goal necessarily

[02:22] But as a hypothesis what you think will happen?

[02:25] Once you have the what problem we saw in your hypothesis of how you're going to solve it then you only have two variables that you have to determine

[02:31] One is what's the thing I'm going to do which is the activity that's the input and then what do I think is going to happen?

[02:36] Which is the output number three?

[02:37] What are we going to do?

[02:38] We are going to call leads within five minutes, right?

[02:42] That is the input. We checked that box great

[02:44] Output is we will get a higher percentage of leads to schedule or show

[02:48] So you'd have your baseline of the input which is today. We're at 37 minutes and we want to be at five

[02:52] That's the input change the output change is going to be we go from 50% scheduled to 70% schedule

[02:57] That's the output change that is a goal that is what we call the before phase the after phase

[03:03] Only has two columns and that's what you review after the quarter is done or the year is over number four

[03:08] What do we think's going to happen? You say okay?

[03:11] Did I do the thing did I do the input did we actually decrease the call time to five minutes if we did

[03:16] Then that's a green and here's where this is important

[03:19] We may have decreased the call time to under five minutes

[03:22] But we may not have increased the scheduling at all that's why it's a hypothesis now did what I wanted to have happened

[03:28] Actually happened and then that is where you can put commentary and so we ended up doing is we ended up getting it down to seven minutes and it didn't

[03:34] Proved at all at this point

[03:35] We don't need to get it down to five because we didn't have any directional improvement

[03:38] It takes a lot of zero to one a lot of shiny objects a lot of new things a lot of trowel

[03:42] A lot of iterate iterate iterate until something clicks in the beginning

[03:46] But big businesses often grow by a series of one percent improvements one percent one percent

[03:52] Because you've seen the Excel math when you're like well if I only got 10 percent more people opt in and I got 15 percent more people to

[03:59] Schedule and I got 20 percent more people to show and I closed one from 25 percent to 35 percent you add all this together in all of a sudden

[04:06] U-tripful the business and the thing is is that everyone gets so distracted with like the I'm gonna reinvent the wheel

[04:11] Rather than just making the wheel a little smoother so it runs fast and so a lot of times

[04:15] Especially in the five ten fifteen twenty million dollar top line range

[04:18] That's some of the systems we have to put in place because that's how the big boys play

[04:21] They beat you because they actually can do a hundred tiny increments

[04:24] I think Jim launch grew 40 percent last year and we did nothing knit all we did

[04:28] We used to be everything we were currently doing a little bit better if you do that year after year after year

[04:32] You become very hard to beat because people will see your marketing on the

[04:36] Outside they'll try and copy your pages of trying copy your emails and one it won't be you so a matter because it's not your story

[04:41] But they don't know all the internal standard operating procedures the internal metrics that you guys are tracking

[04:46] That actually create the growth in the company in a lot of times in the early business

[04:50] Just measuring metrics may be the important goal for the quarter so that you can then improve it

[04:55] Let's say you're your videoographer and a marketing department right each of these goals should start from the top down

[05:02] So if we say these are our five goals as a company the department heads are gonna

[05:05] Probably have multiple activities to to make the first hypothesis true or no

[05:09] I like to have everybody as far down in the organization do this because it actually causes you to think about why you do what you do a

[05:16] A lot of times

[05:17] Include lose motivation because they don't know how what they do every day

[05:20] Ties into bigger picture of how the company grows and makes more money with a video

[05:24] Our for example they're like well, what do I do like what problem my solving the problem is get more customers?

[05:28] They might not think about it that way, but that's the goal well my hypothesis is either we might say it's a volume thing

[05:34] Which is if I double the amount of shorts I make then we will get more traffic to our website from our organic content and then at the end of the quarter

[05:42] Did you make twice as many shorts?

[05:44] Okay, pre fantastic did that result in more links on the site. Oh, it did it huh?

[05:50] Interesting I wonder what would do it?

[05:52] Okay, we need to create more content that's more story based great go back to the beginning if we create more

[05:58] Story based content we will get more link clicks to website that's why goal setting if done right should take work

[06:03] Because it makes you think why am I even doing what I'm doing and if you don't take like a day for a whole quarter to think

[06:09] Why am I even bothering to do this then why are you bothering to do it without understanding what you're trying to improve

[06:15] And the thing is is if you think this way as a teammate or an entrepreneur

[06:19] I promise you you will be so much more valuable to your company if you can even think like a business owner

[06:24] And this is how a good business owner should think and if you can approach or whoever runs your company with this model

[06:30] You may find that they will see you differently because they're like wow

[06:33] Tell me who's making these video clips is actually thinking about what I care about

[06:37] Which is how I'm gonna get more customers whatever the second part of the statement is if you know what you're actually trying to accomplish in the business

[06:42] That it makes a lot easier. What problem we solving what's our hypothesis?

[06:46] What are we gonna do what are we things gonna happen?

[06:48] Did we do it did it happen? That's it and so that has been the simplest goal setting framework that we've used we used this across

[06:53] All-perfolio companies that's what we do across everything and it's been the simplest thing that I've seen

[06:57] I haven't seen anywhere else. It's worked for us and maybe to work for you

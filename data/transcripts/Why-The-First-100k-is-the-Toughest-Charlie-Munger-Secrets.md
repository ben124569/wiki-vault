[00:00] So what's going on everyone?

[00:01] I've got a special podcast episode for you today.

[00:05] What I want to break down is a conversation

[00:07] I was having with a different friend about how $100,000

[00:10] is the hardest amount of money to make.

[00:13] And I was actually talking to him.

[00:14] He's starting his physical therapy clinic practice right now.

[00:19] And he's eating shit for lack of a better term.

[00:23] He's trying to figure this out.

[00:25] And the thing is that $100,000 is the hardest amount

[00:28] to make for a variety of reasons.

[00:30] And that's not me.

[00:30] I'm not the first person to say that Charlie Munger

[00:32] said who's Warren Buffett's business partner

[00:35] said the first 100 grams of bitch.

[00:36] He even says that.

[00:37] It's a quote.

[00:38] You can look it up.

[00:39] But anyways, and there's a bunch of reasons why.

[00:42] And so I wanted to kind of walk through it.

[00:44] The first is the biggest one, which is that when you set

[00:48] the goal at $100,000, you only think of $100,000

[00:51] opportunities.

[00:52] What I mean by that is if I were to say,

[00:56] hey, you need to make $10 million.

[00:58] You can't 100 grand your way times 100 to get there.

[01:02] You have to think of a different way of operating

[01:04] of doing business in order to make $10 million.

[01:07] Because at that point, you know you can't sell your time.

[01:09] It's not going to work.

[01:10] You have to do something else.

[01:12] And so inherently, when someone puts the constraint of,

[01:15] I want to make $100,000 on themselves,

[01:17] then they automatically only can find themselves

[01:20] to vehicles where they have to sell time for money,

[01:23] which are inherently constraining, which

[01:24] is why it's a bitch.

[01:25] It's hard because you literally have to sell your time

[01:27] in order to do it.

[01:28] That being said, most people who've made millions

[01:31] started with something that got them 100 grand.

[01:33] And I will tell you personally, the first $100,000

[01:36] that I put in my bank account was by far the most meaningful

[01:38] of all the money that I've made in my life.

[01:41] I remember when I looked at Leyla and I had $100,000

[01:44] in my bank account after everything.

[01:47] I remember looking her and saying, it's going to be OK.

[01:50] We've got three and a half years of money now

[01:52] that if we mess up for three and a half years,

[01:55] we'll still be all right.

[01:56] And I remember feeling that that sense of relief.

[01:59] And the reason that I think it was so impactful

[02:01] is that difference between zero,

[02:02] where let's say the difference between $1,000

[02:04] in making $100,000 is a 100x increase.

[02:07] For me to have that same 100x increase,

[02:09] I'd have to go from $100,000 to 10 million

[02:10] in my bank account to have the same proportional increase

[02:13] in terms of security.

[02:15] And I'll tell you, even after I $10 million

[02:17] in my bank account, I was like, it still didn't feel as good

[02:19] as the first 100 grand.

[02:21] And so, it doesn't matter where you're at, like, I'll tell you,

[02:24] if it's hard right now, it's normal.

[02:26] It's supposed to be hard, but it will get better

[02:28] because you're going to start thinking differently.

[02:30] Now, back to the original topic of why $100,000

[02:33] is the hardest money to make.

[02:34] First is you think of time vehicles, time for money vehicles.

[02:37] The second is that you have no leverage.

[02:40] So what I mean to that is that inherently,

[02:42] all businesses arbitrage, right?

[02:44] You're buying and selling things at less

[02:46] and you're making the difference, right?

[02:47] If you're in a service business, I'm buying people's labor

[02:50] and I'm selling it at a higher price to the marketplace

[02:52] because I see the discrepancy between that

[02:54] and I can add value to a person by training them in certain ways,

[02:56] or putting them inside of a system,

[02:58] and then the sum of the individuals,

[03:00] or sorry, the sum of the whole is greater than the parts, right?

[03:02] That's essentially what it is.

[03:04] But when you don't have money, you have no leverage on anything

[03:07] and see you have to do everything yourself.

[03:10] And so, again, it takes tons of time to get small amounts

[03:13] of output and so because of that, you're really inefficient, right?

[03:17] Because you have to, and you also have to wear all of the hats.

[03:20] You have to learn every aspect of the business

[03:23] in order to really turn the first dollar.

[03:25] And that takes time and it takes effort,

[03:27] a lot more effort than you think it will, right?

[03:31] And then once you finally figure out how to make the first dollar,

[03:33] you have to keep repeating that action over and over and over

[03:36] and over again until you have $100,000 in your bank account.

[03:39] But once you have that, you can start paying people to do things,

[03:43] you can start paying for advertising

[03:46] and you're not worried about paying your rent

[03:48] or what happens is you now start having the big L word,

[03:51] which is leverage.

[03:52] And you can move the world a lot faster

[03:55] because you can have 10 people doing it up on for you.

[03:57] You can pay a team to make advertising for you.

[04:00] You can have a video set up or whatever

[04:02] that's gonna get you a higher or higher or higher,

[04:04] or make your stuff look better and you get more engagement,

[04:07] or whatever.

[04:08] But the thing is is that that first 100 grand is so hard

[04:12] because the vehicles that exist for it require all your effort.

[04:15] If you're doing sales, right?

[04:17] You're working all the time.

[04:18] If you're doing a job, you're working all the time.

[04:19] If you're, you know, if you wanted to drive Uber

[04:21] to make a hundred grand, you probably worked 12 hours a day.

[04:24] And it would require other time.

[04:25] But things is that once you do that though,

[04:27] you can then start piece mealing out pieces of your day

[04:32] and you do that in reverse order of the value

[04:35] that you can buy that same skill in the marketplace.

[04:38] So let me dive into that for a second.

[04:40] So let's say that in your business,

[04:42] you might be doing 15 different things.

[04:45] But you might find out that the administrative work

[04:47] of scheduling and answering the phone might be the least valuable.

[04:50] They may be, it may not be, whatever.

[04:52] But let's just say it is.

[04:53] And let's say that the marketplace,

[04:54] you can buy that skill for a $10 hour.

[04:57] And so what that means is you can get,

[04:59] let's say four hours of your day back,

[05:01] for $10 hour.

[05:02] And so now you have four more hours.

[05:05] And if you can make more money in those four hours,

[05:07] and this is a key point, I see this one is a mistake too,

[05:10] is people will outsource certain work that they're doing,

[05:13] but they will not replace the time with higher value skill.

[05:15] So then they basically just pay people

[05:18] and then stop working and you make the same amount of money,

[05:19] which can be cool.

[05:21] But if you want to grow,

[05:22] then you're going to need to continue to work

[05:24] and just do higher and higher and higher value,

[05:26] higher leverage time in the time that you buy back.

[05:29] Right?

[05:30] But fundamentally, when you think about your business,

[05:32] says what would it take for me to make a million dollars?

[05:35] What it takes for me to make $10 million dollars?

[05:36] You think of different vehicles in order to get there.

[05:39] And if you don't know of the vehicles,

[05:40] I would highly, highly encourage you to look at the vehicles

[05:44] that already exist.

[05:45] So like, one of the things that's here,

[05:46] here's an interesting nugget for you.

[05:48] There's no reason for anyone in the United States

[05:50] to make less than $25.00.

[05:52] Why?

[05:53] Because in one day, you can go through a certification

[05:56] and become a full bottomist and make $25.00.

[05:58] So who wouldn't take a one day education

[06:00] to triple their income for minimum wage?

[06:03] Who wouldn't do that?

[06:05] The reason people don't do it is because they don't know.

[06:07] People are ignorant, right?

[06:08] And so if you're watching this and you didn't know

[06:10] that even existed, there are so many other opportunities

[06:13] that are like that that you can immediately

[06:15] get more leverage on the time just as you're starting.

[06:17] So if you're working in job and you're not making that,

[06:20] we'll then go find small opportunities,

[06:22] go find little many certifications

[06:23] that you can get that qual for you.

[06:26] Now that's only get a certification if it's required.

[06:28] If it's just like, oh, this is certainly don't worry about it.

[06:30] But like, if you can find these little opportunities,

[06:33] like I'll tell you for me, my plan B of like,

[06:35] if my business was gonna fail,

[06:37] I knew that what I was going to do

[06:39] was I was gonna drive Uber and I was gonna strip at night.

[06:42] That was gonna be my 100% my gig.

[06:44] Because I knew that if I drove Uber 12 hours a day

[06:46] that's just for four hours every night,

[06:48] I would be able to make about 200 grand.

[06:50] And I knew that even though I started at zero,

[06:51] I could do that again and try and get another do over.

[06:55] And the thing is that as your skills that increases,

[06:58] the base level of your building

[07:00] is I like to consider, like this is your building of skills,

[07:03] the base level, your basement continues to rise.

[07:07] And so the level that you can fall down

[07:08] to continue to go be higher and higher.

[07:12] And so once I learned how to sell,

[07:13] I knew that I would never really make less than 250,000 years

[07:17] because I knew I could always go to a cardio-liveship

[07:19] and sell cars.

[07:20] No matter what, I could go sell cars,

[07:21] make 200, 300, 400,000 years.

[07:24] I knew that because I had that skill.

[07:25] And that means that from this point going forward

[07:27] with my life, I'll never make less than that, right?

[07:29] But then I learned how to market.

[07:31] And then as soon as I learned how to market,

[07:32] I knew that that was gonna be mine

[07:34] because now I could take my sales skill

[07:36] and pair it with marketing

[07:37] and then I could generate demand at will, right?

[07:40] And then that means that my new level

[07:41] might be $3 million a year

[07:42] that I'll never make less than

[07:43] because I have the skills that even if I've to start over,

[07:46] I can end there.

[07:47] And the thing is is that if you think about your journey

[07:50] as an entrepreneur in terms of a skill set stacking,

[07:54] all you're doing is acquiring skills

[07:55] and putting your back pocket,

[07:56] putting in your toolkit, right?

[07:58] Then you inherently become more valuable

[07:59] and you stop seeing your failures as failures,

[08:02] but rather lessons on the way to where you're trying to go

[08:05] because you inherently become more valuable

[08:07] because your work works on you more than you work on it.

[08:10] All right, I'll say that again.

[08:12] Your work works on you more than you work on it.

[08:14] And so even if you didn't make a hundred grand the first year,

[08:16] that's okay because you developed the foundational skill sets

[08:20] that maybe got you above 50,000 a year, right?

[08:22] But as long as you were continuing to acquire skills,

[08:25] that baseline will go up

[08:27] and the speed with which you move up

[08:30] will be how much volume you do.

[08:32] So volume of work for a specific skill

[08:35] with deliberate effort will improve your skill set.

[08:39] Now, you can do it faster or slower

[08:41] depending on how quickly you learn the skill,

[08:43] but you still have to learn it.

[08:44] And there's usually a certain amount of volume that has to happen,

[08:46] which means that there's some amount of time,

[08:48] but then how do some people acquire skills faster than others?

[08:51] Some people are more deliberate with their practice.

[08:53] Some people get mentors and experts that feed into them.

[08:56] Every valuable skill that I've acquired in my life,

[08:58] I've paid someone to acquire so I could get it faster.

[09:00] All right, and so if you're like, well, I don't have money.

[09:02] Then do the leverage, do the shitty work now,

[09:05] do the first hundred thousand dollar that's a bitch,

[09:08] do that work now, you have to trade some of your life

[09:11] for money and that's okay,

[09:12] which is why I have a saying, which is,

[09:13] you can't be busy and broke, right?

[09:15] You can't be both.

[09:16] If you're busy, you should be making money, right?

[09:20] And if you're broke, you're not busy,

[09:21] which means you've got time,

[09:22] so you can always trade back and forth time for money, right?

[09:25] If you have more money, then,

[09:27] and but you're busy all the time,

[09:29] then you can trade some of that money back

[09:30] to buy some time back, right?

[09:31] But you can't be busy and broke, all right?

[09:33] So think about that.

[09:34] And if you feel like you are busy and broke,

[09:36] I guarantee you're wasting a lot of your time.

[09:37] So anyways, to ring this full circle,

[09:41] a hundred thousand dollars is by far one of the hardest

[09:43] amounts of money to make,

[09:43] because we think about it only in time vehicles,

[09:46] and for many of us, it's the first thing you have to do.

[09:48] So just bite the bullet, go do it,

[09:50] and then after that, you can start leveling up your skills

[09:53] that you can pay for skills,

[09:55] you can pay for things to happen faster for you,

[09:58] you can pay for other people to do some of the lower value work

[10:01] that you're doing because they're earlier on in their journey,

[10:03] so you can buy their time that's less valuable than yours,

[10:06] and you continue to work up and build the foundation

[10:08] of that building that eventually becomes a skyscraper

[10:10] of your skills.

[10:11] And then you'll have the perspective to identify

[10:14] the 10 million, the hundred million,

[10:16] the billion dollar opportunities,

[10:17] and go all in on them because at this point,

[10:19] you'll have the skill set to make it happen.

[10:21] So anyways, hope that was a vibe before you,

[10:23] hope you're having an amazing day,

[10:25] and I'll see you in the next video.

[10:27] Bye.

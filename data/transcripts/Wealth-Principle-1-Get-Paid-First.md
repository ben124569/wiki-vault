[00:00] What's going on everyone? It's Alex Moes here and if you do to the channel,

[00:03] Bill 3 comes listed at $110 million in sales and continue to do so. Now we invest in other companies as well.

[00:09] And one of the talks I want to talk about today is the money ladder.

[00:12] And so this was actually came up during a conversation I was having with Layla my wife.

[00:16] And she was like, you should make a podcast about this. She's like, you know,

[00:19] a lot of people don't know how this works. And so right now I'm writing a handful of books around

[00:24] a one of them is kind of wealth beliefs that that changed my life.

[00:28] And then I've got a bunch of books on acquisition stuff that's coming out. So what's the money ladder?

[00:32] That's what I'm calling it. But basically it's the order in which people get paid. And a lot of times

[00:38] like one of the biggest beliefs in my life that changed as I got wealthier and that change before I got

[00:41] wealthy that caused me to become more wealthy was how I viewed the flow of money. All right. So what I mean

[00:47] by that is if you look at who gets paid when right when money flows you can see typically where

[00:55] where and who is making who is the most control and who's making the money. All right. So think about it

[01:00] from a concept of work and payment. All right. So at the bottom here you have an employee in general.

[01:07] All right. And there's nothing wrong with this, right? Like I was an employee too. So like it's not

[01:12] that there's anything wrong. It's more so that like this you should have to understand

[01:16] how it works from a hierarchy standpoint. What happens with an employee is that they work first,

[01:20] right? They work first and then they get paid two weeks later. So they front their labor,

[01:26] they front their time and then they get paid two weeks later, right? Or four weeks later depending

[01:30] on what the job is. Right? So that is if you look at the money flow they have cost of time,

[01:35] cost of effort that goes out and then delay and then they get paid. Right? Now if you have got

[01:43] somebody who's self-employed this is kind of like a lot of contractors, vendors, gig economy, etc.

[01:51] These people typically, they're trying to choose scenarios here. One is and you can see because

[01:56] these people are a little bit more flexible. You'll see them kind of move on this money ladder. So on one

[02:01] on the total, obviously worst side of the equation, the lowest side of the equation, they basically

[02:06] model the same thing that an employee would, that an normal employee would set up which is

[02:10] they front the work and they get paid later. Right? Later, if they get better and better and

[02:14] they become truly more independent contractor type things, then they might get paid half up front

[02:19] and then half upon delivery. Right? So it's kind of like 50, 50. Right? And then later,

[02:25] right? Then they start moving up this ladder. Some of them will get paid up front or as they

[02:30] work, etc. Right? So the next one is paid first. Right? So think about this. If you go to a doctor,

[02:46] they don't do the surgery and then they get paid. They get paid and then they do the surgery. Right?

[02:51] And so if you think about your work like that or your business like that, you get paid first. Right?

[02:56] Now, this is where like payment plans and things like that. Like the more someone pays up front,

[03:02] and then I would say like in full, right? That's another kind of mini variable here. Right?

[03:07] They payings somewhat upfront or they pay all upfront or whatever. Getting paid first is another level

[03:14] of kind of wealth and kind of control and power. All right? Now, but notice if you're looking at

[03:18] this from the video, we're still got, we get still got a little bit of ways to go up here. Right?

[03:23] So then above this, right? This is kind of like this is kind of where I see people ending and

[03:30] then you kind of get into like the business side of it, right? So above this you'd have like banks.

[03:40] So what do banks get? So banks have something called a capital stack. So this is what I mean by

[03:46] that is when you buy your house, right? You're actually the banks really buying your house and

[03:53] then you're paying the bank back. The bank is a preferred creditor. What that means is if, you know,

[03:58] chance the fan, they get paid first and then whatever's left over is yours. Right? That's how it works.

[04:05] That's why you repay your mortgage when you sell your house and then whatever's left over,

[04:10] the scraps go to you, right? Banks get paid first. They're preferred creditors.

[04:16] And so when you're thinking about like money in general, look at

[04:21] where the exchange flows, right, is it who's fronting time and then getting paid or who's splitting it

[04:25] up a fron or who gets paid and full, right? And then if shit goes bad,

[04:30] who's the one who gets paid out first and who's left with the scraps? Now I'd say that there's one

[04:35] thing above banks here. Try what's in his insurance. This is really interesting. I've learned a lot

[04:42] about insurance over the last year. So insurance is fascinating. Insurance gets paid

[04:51] far before they ever have to do anything. Think about that. You pay your insurance for 20 years

[04:59] before they have to fulfill what they are due and they also can not end up having to fulfill

[05:04] anything and you just get paid for 20 years for truly doing nothing. Right? If you really think

[05:10] about how the money flows, like really think about it for a second. Imagine you have a business.

[05:14] Imagine I started signing people out for insurance business. Alex Hormosie, you know, insurance.

[05:20] And I just started going around saying, hey, I'll insure your life, hey, I'll insure your life,

[05:23] hey, I'll insure your life, right? And people just start saying, sure, I'll sign up. And they

[05:28] start paying me $1,000 a month and I've got 100 families, 500 families who start paying me $1,000,

[05:33] $2,000 a month. I'm doing a million dollars a month and I do that for decades, right? And then

[05:40] as people, you know, come to term because of how I wrote the contracts or whatever, this is obviously

[05:45] a shitty way of doing it, but can't believe it does happen. You know, they might not qualify or they

[05:51] can no longer afford the fees because I increase the fees as they become higher and higher risk,

[05:56] right? I've actually mean needing to fulfill this stuff. So the point is, is that if you look at

[06:02] insurance, it's basically the opposite of a depreciating asset. So when you, when you depreciate a

[06:07] building, so you buy something and then you depreciate in your tax a lot, people see that as a good

[06:11] thing. So, oh, yeah, well, we can depreciate it. It's only a cool good thing because in your mind

[06:16] because the tax code, not because it's actually good that things get old and become outdated, right?

[06:20] Think about it. So insurance is the reverse of that. So instead of putting all your capital up front

[06:26] and then having depreciate something over time, insurance companies get all the money up front

[06:30] and then they get to appreciate the money over time and then pay you off of that. Right?

[06:35] And there's a reason that insurance companies, the oldest companies in the world, the oldest ones

[06:40] are, you know, 182, 300, 300 years old and it's because that is a business model that is unreal.

[06:48] They even, I mean, they predate the tax code. They don't even have to pay taxes. So interesting.

[06:52] So when I think about this stuff, this was, this was hopefully this is valid to be valuable for you

[06:58] when you think about, and you know, actually I put up one level above this, the top level.

[07:07] Also, a God in franchise wars. Obviously, I'm not saying franchise wars are God. It's kind of just

[07:12] being funny. Don't get personal. All right. And so the last level above this is that God gets 10%

[07:19] off the top period for life. And so that's where you can see the money ladder.

[07:28] Right? All the way at the bottom, people front their time, front their effort, front their labor,

[07:34] they delay, and then they get paid. They move up to self-employed, they front, they're time,

[07:39] where they split, you know, they get half now, half later. And as they move up this ladder,

[07:43] they can pay more upfront. Right? A lot of that's because of demand because if how good you are.

[07:47] Right? You're a doctor. You get paid first before you do your surgery. Right? If you're a professional,

[07:52] you're a great consultant. Something like that. You get paid upfront. Right?

[07:55] Beyond that, you've got banks who they get paid first and they leave people to scrap afterwards.

[08:03] That's when there's a defined pot of money. Above that, you've got insurance companies who get paid

[08:08] the whole time and then may or may not ever have to fulfill on their work. Right? So then

[08:13] there they get money guaranteed, but the work that they have to fulfill on is not guaranteed.

[08:17] Think about that. Right? And then above that, you've got God who gets 10% off top line of what you make.

[08:25] So I hope this was bad before you. This is the money ladder as I see wealth and as I've thought of these things

[08:31] as time has gone on, I shifted my views around it, I changed the way we do agreements, all that kind of stuff.

[08:37] And so hopefully you find some value in it. So this is one of the beliefs that changed my life that made me a lot

[08:42] while here. It's watching where the money flows, watch it where it goes and watching who gets paid one.

[08:46] Keeping awesome. Bye!

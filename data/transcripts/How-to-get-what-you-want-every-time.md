[00:00] Over my career, acquiring in daily business is for acquisition.com, I've done a lot of deals.

[00:04] I want to put the five most brilliant effective tactics that I know in one video for you.

[00:09] A lot of these things I didn't actually learn from books. I learned them from mentors and

[00:13] actually seeing them do it and learning it in the streets in the real world. Most anybody

[00:17] tactics like don't actually drive the needle, but these five actually have gotten deals done

[00:22] and improve my situation or standing in the deal. So let's dive in. There's three contexts

[00:27] that you're going to use each of these skills with. The first is with employees and this goes

[00:31] both ways. If you're an employee trying to negotiate with an employee, you're then that applies.

[00:36] The second is going to be vendors. Now this also applies if you're a vendor who's dealing with

[00:40] customers and then third, you've got what I would consider partners. This is when you do deals,

[00:45] M&A, things like that, and investment. So these are kind of the three big vectors that all of

[00:49] this stuff applies to. So if you're like, I'm not sure if this will work for me. You for sure,

[00:54] even if you don't have a business, you are an employee and if you aren't an employee,

[00:58] you don't want to use that. You certainly have vendors that come to your house and do things for you.

[01:02] Like this is the fruit of life. You have to negotiate and you get what you negotiate, not what you

[01:07] deserve. That means how not fair, but it's also the truth. Number one, this is actually from a

[01:12] Harvard Business School thing that I learned from Shoran Sarvata. It's called Baton. Now I didn't

[01:17] know the fancy term for it, but it means best alternative to a negotiated agreement. So what

[01:23] does this really mean? Research is shown that having strong baton, basically a strong alternative,

[01:29] gives you significant leverage in negotiations. Negotiations all about leverage.

[01:34] London Business School did a study and they found that negotiators who know their alternatives

[01:38] set higher aspirations so they ask for more. They make more aggressive first offers and they

[01:42] negotiate ultimately better outcomes. So your baton serves as almost like an anchor, a counter

[01:47] anchor that you have in the back of your mind of what you're negotiating with. It's kind of like a

[01:51] source of power. It's a decision standard. The only accept deals that are better than your best alternative.

[01:56] You can think about this in any setting. So if you're with a girl and you know that you can only

[01:59] date tens, if a seven comes along, you're like, well my alternatives attend. So I'm only dealing

[02:05] with tens. If someone says, hey, I'll be willing to buy all of your inventory for 10 bucks a piece,

[02:10] and somebody else comes along and says, I'll do it for nine. Instead of just saying no, you're like,

[02:14] I'll do it for 10, 50, or I'll do it for 11. You can edge them up, but if you know that it's

[02:19] not going to matter, then it doesn't matter. So I'll tell you something that recently happened.

[02:23] I'm right now negotiating to buy a home. It's something that Layla wants and it's aggressive.

[02:28] We already have a home that we like a lot. I really like the house we have. My best alternative

[02:33] to buying this house is doing nothing and just enjoying the home that I already have. They're in a

[02:39] terrible position because right now I know that they haven't had anyone else who's bid on the property

[02:45] because it's aggressively priced. I'll put that away. It's them versus me and it's who wants it less.

[02:50] The reason bad is so important. You're like, okay, I get that. How do I have a best alternative

[02:54] to negotiate agreement? You win negotiations and I'm starting with this one because I think it's all

[02:58] five of this or six or one's that I'm going to show you. You're going to be so important. But this one

[03:02] is probably the greatest source of psychological power. And you do this before you sit down to the table.

[03:07] Me going to look at these homes, I know I don't have to buy the homes. When I was selling

[03:12] gym lunch and prestige labs, I was like, I can just keep the businesses and they'll just keep

[03:15] making me money. I don't need to sell them. And from negotiating for that position, you only want to

[03:20] sell when you don't want to sell. You want to buy when you don't want to buy because you have something

[03:24] else. If you're looking for jobs as an employee, you want to negotiate when you already have another

[03:29] offer. So if you're going to your existing employer, get another offer and then negotiate with that,

[03:34] you can only do that so many times if we start losing goodwill. So you have to make sure that you're

[03:36] balancing that well. If you're dealing with a vendor, then you're like, okay, I'm going to get

[03:40] multiple beds before I'm going to decide to work with you because these are what I'm considering.

[03:44] You'll get so educated from actually negotiating four or five six of these vendor agreements

[03:48] that you'll learn other terms that other people include that you can use, which is a later strategy

[03:52] that I'll explain. Getting multiple offers before you sit down increases your bets. So for sure

[03:57] don't take the first offer because even if you have first offer within the negotiation with one guy,

[04:01] but then you have that offer compared to all the other officer that you're ultimately going to get

[04:04] to do the work. On the vendor side, it's reversed. What's my best alternative? What are my other

[04:09] customers? If I've got 20 other customers, it got people banging on the door, it's a supply to

[04:14] man thing. So I've got more demand for my services than I've supplied. And so if you don't want it,

[04:18] don't worry, I've got another customer behind you. And so this is the leverage that we go back and

[04:22] forth in negotiations. And then finally with partnerships, the same idea. How can I get multiple offers

[04:27] from people wanting to buy my business? And the same degree for me, if I'm trying to buy a business,

[04:30] then I want to not have to buy the business because I got other businesses I'm looking at. So no matter

[04:34] what all of this is one before you sit down to the table. Right now, if you sit down and you need

[04:40] this deal and you have no other offers, all the little tactics that you can try, sure you can try to

[04:45] do it, but the things that it's just trying to win it poker only on bluffing. It's a bad position

[04:50] to be in. I would rather have pocket aces. If you have other offers, there's two different ways

[04:54] of thinking about this. So one is you can be overt about it and say, listen, this is the counteroffer,

[04:59] if you can beat the offer, beat it. If you can't, no worries, we don't need a waste time. The other

[05:03] ways that you just have it in the back of your mind, then you just see what you can get because

[05:06] the thing is somebody else is giving you a $10 offer. If you say, hey, I've got a $10 offer. Maybe this

[05:10] person will just beat it by $10.25. But if you have the confidence that you know you're going to sell

[05:14] the inventory no matter what for a profit, shoot for 11. Shoot for 12. Shoot for 15. Like you can shoot

[05:20] way higher because you know your plan B's not bad. And so when you show it, they're just going to

[05:23] twice basically marginally edge it versus you having the confidence to basically swing big.

[05:28] Ripple, if you are a business owner and you are not growing a space to do like, I'd like to give

[05:32] you a free gift. So my team and I put together the $100 million scaling roadmap, which is basically

[05:38] 200 hours of us looking over all the portfolio companies have had. And what stages of growth they

[05:42] went through and more importantly, where they got stuck and how they got passed it. And so we

[05:47] broken in these 10 stages and we made this little kind of quiz thing where if you put in your

[05:50] business information, it'll tell you where you're at and the most important part for you,

[05:54] what to do for each of the functions of the business across product marketing sales, customer success,

[05:58] recruiting IT, human resources and finance. And so no matter what you're struggling with,

[06:03] someone else has already struggled with it and solved it. And so I'd like to give you this thing

[06:07] absolutely free. You go to Aquasin.com for slash roadmap, plug in your business information. And if you

[06:11] want us to actually help you de-contrain the business and you're trying to scale, we'd love to

[06:16] help you out on the thank you page you just book a call off my team and we will look at the business,

[06:21] see if we can help. And if we can, we'll invite you out to Vegas and we'll do this in person live.

[06:26] So that's cool. Hit the link. Otherwise, enjoy the rest of the day. Now the second is a big one.

[06:30] And a lot of negotiation books and courses and stuff talk about this and people are like,

[06:34] hey, I'm not trying to anchor here. It doesn't matter if you say I'm not trying to anchor here.

[06:37] It's an anchor. An anchor is the first number that is said in a negotiation. If you're like,

[06:42] hey, what do you think you'd be willing to do this for and someone's like, I was thinking,

[06:46] I could maybe do a for $2,000. That's now the anchor. You want to get less than that and you

[06:50] were like shootouts, hoping for $500. Well, something you should have said $500 first because now

[06:54] their 2000s is ridiculous. There is a strategy called counter-acoring but it's typically not as effective as

[06:59] an anchor, but it's the only move you have left. Now the flip side is the reason a lot of people don't

[07:03] want to put the anchor out is because they don't want to shortchange if someone who's going to say,

[07:05] yes to $5,000 you put $2,000 out there, like damn. Because whenever happens, if someone gives you a fast

[07:11] yes, you're like, no, I love so much money on the table. So I'll give you a little pro tip that I've learned

[07:15] being on the other side of this. If I have somebody who comes to me and says, hey, I'll do it for $2,000.

[07:21] And I would have paid $5 and I say, yeah, $2,000 works, the next thing I do is I say, hey,

[07:27] and if you were curious of whether I would do it for $2,500, I wouldn't have done. And the things

[07:32] that it puts them at ease that like, you know what you wouldn't have done. What happened is I bought

[07:36] a super expensive penthouse a few years ago and after I bought it, the guy who sold it to me,

[07:41] obviously a wealthy guy too, he said, hey, we accepted your first offer and you're probably wondering

[07:46] if we would have done it for us, he said, I wouldn't have sold it for a penny less. It felt so classy,

[07:50] maybe he would have sold it for penilas. I have no idea, but in the moment, actually like I was like,

[07:55] okay, I just made me feel a lot better. So if you're in the reverse situation, I would put someone

[07:59] at ease by just saying, hey, I wouldn't have done it for penilas, I wouldn't have done it for any more,

[08:03] whatever. What's interesting is that Daniel Nobel Prize winner figured out that people give excessive

[08:07] weight to the initial information and make insufficient adjustments from that starting point.

[08:12] It's a psychological bias. Basically, it's like you want to anchor as high as possible. That's why

[08:16] I'm a big advocate of getting the gas. If you put the big number out there, because it completely

[08:20] shifts the whole negotiation numbers to way, way higher and the things people think in different

[08:25] increments and that's what we want to change. If you say, I'll do this work for $100,000,

[08:28] whatever, you're in construction. If someone was thinking 10, their increments now become the

[08:33] entirety of what they were willing to pay. They're going to be like, can you do it for 80?

[08:36] Obviously, I'm going to think it in $20,000 increments as a side note, you can also anchor

[08:40] increments. So explain what that means. I'll actually walk you through the house negotiation that

[08:44] I'm actively in right now. The house was listed at 25 million. Then they dropped it to 20 million

[08:49] because the market's changed. It's like that. Okay. So now they're at 20 million. So I made an offer

[08:54] for 15 million. They countered and said, we'll do it for 16, nine. So big move on their part.

[09:01] They're moving aggressively. They're trying to sell the house. They moved a lot towards me because

[09:05] they're trying to get a deal done. The natural thing that some people might think is, okay, they're at 17

[09:08] year at 15 counter with 16 here. So what I did is I counter with 15.25. So they moved 3 million.

[09:17] I moved up 250 grand. Things that there's this idea of like movement of you making an offer.

[09:21] I'm making an offer. So if I say 15.25, what am I indicating? I'm not willing to move very much.

[09:26] I'm going to add a reciprocity, which we'll cover later. I'm willing to move a little bit.

[09:30] I'm going to make some counter offer, but I'm not going to give a lot. Then I can stack in other

[09:35] terms that make it more ameliorable for that. My initial offer, I had two other things that I was like,

[09:40] okay, I can offer cash. My first offer is not going to be cash. I can also say, hey,

[09:44] I have furnishings in the house, which are super expensive. I don't want to have to deal with

[09:47] refurnishing the house. What I did was when I moved up to 15.25, I swed in the deal by making it

[09:53] in an all cash. But then I also said, I also want the $4 million a furniture that's in the house,

[09:57] which is technically a worse second offer than my first offer. But the thing is that I moved the

[10:01] number up. And a lot of people are always way too fixated on the price and not enough on the

[10:04] terms. One is we anchor with our original price and also in the increments that we move it.

[10:08] And this was something that took me actually a while to figure out. And so let me tell you a story

[10:11] about this one. So when my partners at my gym, way back in the day, I learned this for them.

[10:15] You had to get this big custom front desk built. So I had multiple cutouts. We had multiple sales

[10:19] people, big impressive thing. You get a custom built. The guy came out, they built this whole thing.

[10:23] He was like, hey, when we went to do the final inspection, we noticed that they had a kind of

[10:26] nicked a corner of it, just from moving it around or whatever happened, right? It was a small nick,

[10:30] but it was noticeable. My partner goes to the guy and he says, hey, how much would it cost you

[10:35] to replace this? And the guy, of course, because he doesn't want to rebuild the whole thing. He's,

[10:39] oh my God, it would be a huge deal for us to have to, like, just this little thing. We have to go back to the

[10:43] shop. We have to do those stuff. It would probably cost us $1500 just to replace that. And he says,

[10:47] that sounds like a pretty good place to start it for a discount. Nasty. I was like, oh, I'm going to use that.

[10:54] If there's ever someone who messes something up, instead of saying, hey, what can you knock off the

[10:59] price? Ask them what the big inconvenience would be for them. A scribe price to it. And then they have a

[11:04] hard time backing down from that because they just said, that's how much it would cost them to fix it.

[11:08] Then you should probably discount us by that much because that was the size of the mess up. So you get

[11:12] them bidding for themselves and then you flip it. So number three, I learned this from a different

[11:16] mentor. They call it measos, but basically multiple equivalent simultaneous offers. So what does that mean?

[11:21] That means that I present offer A, offer B, and offer C, or just offer A and B. It doesn't really

[11:31] matter. You're going to have two offers. You're going to have three offers. And each of these have

[11:34] different prices in terms associated with them. And so what happens is when you make multiple

[11:38] equivalent offers, it's like embedding reciprocity. It's like, hey, I'm trying to be reasonable. I just want

[11:42] to figure out what works best for you because all three of these work for me, but which one's better.

[11:46] This is a way of actually teasing out what someone else's priorities are if they're not willing to

[11:49] tell you. Because a lot of times you want to hold your car close and not say, what are the things

[11:52] that are most valuable to you? Now over time you put some trust, you put some report, and you will

[11:55] be able to share because ideally something that's important to you is not important to them and

[11:59] they give you this one and something that's important to them and it's important to you. You give

[12:02] them and that's fundamentally a good negotiation. One of the big things that I misunderstood in the

[12:05] beginnings that I assumed negotiation was zero some game and it's never a zero some game because

[12:10] you're a different person. You have different needs. You're always going to have some things that

[12:13] will be more important to you than other people. And in that situation, it's like you want to just

[12:16] interlock the things that matter most to each person. That's where it becomes a positive

[12:19] so we can both parties are better off from basically giving and taking in places that are

[12:23] less meaningful to them and more meaningful to the other person. Journal of personality and social

[12:27] psychology showed that presenting multiple equivalent offers simultaneously increases the

[12:32] likelihood of finding mutually beneficial solutions. This approach demonstrates flexibility while

[12:37] also maintaining your core interest because you're the one who's presenting all the offers. It's

[12:41] almost like a reverse assumed close. Hey, I'll do any of these three things and you just pick

[12:46] the one that works for you and then the thing is they're picking all any of these I said already

[12:50] worked for me. Let me give you like a real word example. So let's say option A is lower monthly

[12:55] fee with a longer commitment. Option B is a higher monthly fee but has premium support and then

[13:00] option C is kind of like a pays you go with slightly higher rates but maximum flexibility. Right?

[13:06] So all three options for giving you similar overall value but you might look at them and be like

[13:11] I just want to know which one meets your needs better. From their answers you'll be able to

[13:14] understand their motivations. Now let me tell you some knowledge from the street. If someone gives

[13:20] you multiple offers if you're on the other side of the table what I like to do is say I like the

[13:24] best part of this one and I like the best part of this one and I like the best part of this one and why

[13:29] do we make it offer that is the best of all three and I learn this from my French run.

[13:37] Guys done more deals than anyone I know. I was like oh that's good. So the flip side is you can

[13:41] ask someone hey can you give me two or three versions with this deal might look like and then they

[13:45] come up with their versions the deals and then you say great I like this piece happily do option D.

[13:50] And what's nice about this is it also shows some active listing for you. You countering

[13:54] with something like this or even taking two of the three components. Two of those components might be

[13:57] mean for for you and not for them. Again because they put them in the different deals. You might find

[14:01] out that you can get more of the things that you want just by asking. So number four,

[14:05] rest of the property. Now rest of the property is key in all sorts of persuasion and I'll say this

[14:11] one caveat that I believe. Rest of the property only matters in cultures were rest of the

[14:15] property matters. There are cultures were rest of the property is not nearly as important. This is

[14:19] where sometimes when cultures mix people take advantage of systems because that's not as important

[14:25] in the culture they came from. And so the culture where the person is giving first in order

[14:29] because they expect something back the other culture will just take advantage and be like look at

[14:33] the city it he just gave me some free stuff. As you want to make sure that basically you're within

[14:37] a culture or society that reciprocity is the norm. But if it is the norm there's huge amounts of

[14:42] things that you can use from persuasion perspective. So the beauty with how we structure reciprocity

[14:48] is that people are more sensitive to the fact that they gave something and you give something.

[14:53] What's more difficult is describing the relative value. So let me give you an extreme example.

[14:58] Let's say that I take someone's order from the counter and I bring it to the table where both

[15:03] eating lunch. The person might say thank you for doing that. If I then said hey can you pick me up

[15:08] and drop me off from the airport tomorrow? I mean I did get to your lunch yesterday. The thing is

[15:12] that it poses it looks like it smells like reciprocity but the value of those two concessions are

[15:18] wildly different. And so the idea is that we're trying to trade concessions in a way that is still

[15:22] I've contagious to us. What I like to do in terms of my thinking like the example that I gave

[15:26] in terms of multiple scientific and useful things. It's offers which is why I think this works well

[15:29] post that. Is that I try and break each of my things due as many different pieces as possible

[15:34] so I can trade more times. So like this house example that I gave you earlier. If I have 15 million

[15:40] but this thing is going to be financed. Can I go cash or finance? I can do closing period. I could say

[15:45] it's a 90 day closer, a 30 day close. That's going to be significantly more valuable. I could say

[15:49] furniture versus not. There's other terms that we can basically weave into the deal that I'm not

[15:54] going to play all those cards at once. Now this one is a real straight to a straight to a straight

[15:58] forward. But a transaction like this it's like you want to think what are all the variables. We

[16:04] want to use all the value equation variables. Speed. How can I deliver this faster? How can I do

[16:10] it slower? We've got the actual price obviously on top that we have the risk associated. So who's

[16:16] going to be taking you on more risk in this situation? And what are the different types of risk

[16:20] that someone's taking on? Then we have ease. How can we make this easier harder for the other

[16:25] person? For each of these components you want to take whatever you're offering whether it's an

[16:28] employee or whether it's a vendor or whether it's a deal. I want to look through each of these lenses

[16:33] and they how can I have more variables at my disposal so that when it comes to the horse trading

[16:39] I can make a small concession in ease and they only have two variables and I've got five. And when I

[16:45] have five I can give without changing my price and say hey I'll do 15 with ease. They'll come

[16:51] down from 17 to 16 and I say cool I'll do 15 with ease and risk and then they come down from 16 to

[16:59] 15.5 and I say cool I'll do 15 with ease risk and speed. And so when we do it like that then all

[17:07] of a sentence like I'm still keeping the reciprocity but I just have more errors in my quiver.

[17:11] When you're sitting down at the table you want to think through all of these different

[17:14] variables that you have at your disposal. For me I have this big deal sheet that has 80 different

[17:18] things that I can change about a deal so that when I go into the conversation I have so many things

[17:23] that I can move flexibly to make my offers more compelling without the unstated assumptions that

[17:29] people all have because things they're assuming the deal just says these two things and

[17:34] everything else is the way they want. And for you you have 80 other variables that you're like oh I

[17:38] can change this one I can change this one and that allows you to stay in reciprocity with the other

[17:43] person that ultimately gets you a better deal long term. So as we're thinking through this it's like

[17:47] if we sit down on the table and we have one or multiple other offers that we think are really

[17:52] compelling and interesting and we use that as our psychological power so we can anchor super high

[17:57] and we anchor low in terms of our counters right anchor high in terms of our initial anchor low

[18:03] in terms of our counter offers and then we have multiple simultaneous offers that are either presented

[18:07] to us or that we can present to somebody else using more variables and then horse trade with

[18:11] reciprocity so we can stay in the pocket but still more or less they say the same initial offer

[18:15] then we're probably going to increase likelihood that we get a good deal done. Number five

[18:20] is framing. I would say this is most important especially for employees and vendors less so

[18:25] for partnership type or like M&A type stuff but it can probably also be important here too but I'll

[18:30] just give more use cases in these two right now. So if we're talking about framing then how we position

[18:36] something is going to matter a lot. So if I'm an employee selling to an employee or you're

[18:41] which is fundamentally what we're doing I would probably say something that the extent of we want to

[18:44] make investments in these places and I see me coming in as an investment not a cost and ideally if

[18:49] we frame this as how am I going to get a return on this investment then I'm no longer a cost center

[18:54] in the business at all because I'm just a percentage commission essentially on what I'm bringing

[19:00] the business. If I'm a vendor to the same degree I'm going to try and frame something as an

[19:03] investment. I'm going to frame it based on return not based on overhead. On the flip side you always

[19:08] want to reframe the other way which is you want to reframe this as cost you want to reframe this

[19:12] as overhead so that ultimately you have more basically negotiating power because you're pushing

[19:16] them down they're aching themselves up. A lot of times people don't even understand framing and so

[19:20] let's just accept the frame that you present. So rather than saying hey this is in Cauchy five grand

[19:24] we usually say like for 5,000-dollar investment you can see 15,000-dollar and maintenance cost savings.

[19:28] That's very different than this is going to cost five grand. If that's the reality then it's going to be

[19:33] far more compelling and far more likely the person's going to accept your offer even though

[19:36] functionalities the exact same thing. I was talking to you a few home services businesses that do

[19:40] kind of construction stuff and so I talked to a pool guy, talked to a patio guy,

[19:43] talked to an awning guy who do like awnings on top of baddies and I said um do you have any data

[19:49] that shows resell value of homes that have awnings versus not? Or do you have any data on

[19:54] resell value of this specific neighborhood that you're going to go into of pool versus not pool.

[19:58] If someone knows they spend a hundred thousand dollars on a pool and it adds a hundred thousand dollars

[20:02] their house I'm like then the pool's free except you get to enjoy the pool the whole time.

[20:08] So this we shouldn't even be talking about that because you're really just taking it from one pocket and

[20:11] putting it to another. You're the one to get to the keep the pool I don't keep the pool. It's all for you.

[20:15] So the idea is how we frame it. If you're going into these things that's a Cauchy 100 grand that's

[20:19] a very different frame than your house is currently worth a million. The other houses that are

[20:22] selling you on point two off pools is going to Cauchy 100 grand for the pool but you're going to

[20:25] 200,000 dollars in home value. What we talking about is a very different conversation. So tactically when

[20:30] you're in one of these situations we want to have the data to support our argument for whatever

[20:34] our framing is. And typically it's going to be some sort of return especially if it's a monetary

[20:38] thing right. We want to frame it in terms of what the image. And so the strong

[20:41] visitors in this say look at the other 10 houses that sold in this neighborhood. Look at however many

[20:46] deals that have been done they all have these components the ones that didn't suffer this sort of

[20:50] loss and you know what maybe it's not a one to one ratio. It costs you a hundred grand and that

[20:54] houses the pools it's an extra fifty thousand dollars. Okay let's not frame it as a hundred we can frame

[20:58] it as half off but you also get to enjoy the pool for that whole time. And so if you think you're

[21:03] going to sell this in how many years do you want to enjoy it and barely pay much at all over that

[21:08] period of time? Probably rock and roll. If you liked this video you're going to love the 13 years

[21:13] of brutal business lessons that I have learned over my career. Enjoy.

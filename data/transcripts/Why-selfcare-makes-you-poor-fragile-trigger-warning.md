[00:00] What's going on everyone in this video?

[00:02] I'm gonna talk about why I think self-care is absolute nonsense

[00:05] and why you should run the other way for anybody who's telling you otherwise.

[00:08] And if you don't know, I am my name is Alex Mozi on acquisition.com.

[00:10] Got some news for you.

[00:11] We run a portfolio of $100 million companies that make all the money and it doesn't matter.

[00:17] Anyways, so purpose of this video like I said, all this self-care, who do nonsense,

[00:22] gets people in a lot of trouble.

[00:23] And the reason for that is because we think that for some reason we are doing something wrong

[00:28] when we are not self-careing, because it is bad to not self-care because we should we must

[00:32] or else or what.

[00:34] And the reason this pisses me off the reason that I made a tweet that went viral this morning about this

[00:38] is that weekends are new for humans.

[00:41] They're not even 100 years old.

[00:43] 1929 in England is when the first weekend got passed by a union.

[00:47] And it's because people hated what they were doing for their life.

[00:50] And so if you want to truly give self-care,

[00:54] then stop hating what you do every day.

[00:57] Now, will concept.

[00:58] I know.

[00:58] Stop hanging out with people that fucking suck mind blowing, like I said.

[01:03] I know.

[01:03] And the reason that I am so passionate about this is that I have been told throughout my entire life

[01:08] that I was working too much, I was not balancing the things that I was supposed to be balancing.

[01:13] And you know what?

[01:14] Who gives a shit?

[01:15] It's my life.

[01:16] I don't need to live by anyone else's rules than either to you.

[01:18] Right?

[01:19] And so when people say you should be doing this, you are not doing XYZ.

[01:23] Just take a pause and be like, are these rules that I want to listen to?

[01:26] Are those your rules that you're trying to apply to my life?

[01:29] Because there are no rules.

[01:30] You can do whatever the hell you want.

[01:31] If you want to work for a year straight, work for a year straight.

[01:34] And the reason you can work for a year straight is because you like what you do.

[01:37] The reason these people try and project their own self-hatred for their own lives,

[01:41] onto you is because they cannot imagine a world in which someone might actually like what they do every day.

[01:47] And didn't don't need an escape, a break from what their existence is on a daily basis.

[01:53] And so don't feel guilty for just being you.

[01:55] And if you don't like your life every day, rather than trying to figure out and make time for self-care,

[02:01] it would probably be better to flip the ratio and start thinking,

[02:04] what can I do in my actual life to stop hating it so much that I need an escape from it?

[02:08] Right? And that's different from like, yes, you need a sleep, yes, you need to rest, etc.

[02:13] But there's a difference between that and like, I just need a total spot.

[02:17] And if that's how you relax cool.

[02:18] But the thing is is projecting on someone else how they should must need to,

[02:23] you have to relax or do whatever is not in a sense of it.

[02:27] It doesn't exist.

[02:28] Right? I wanted to make this video even though it's short,

[02:31] because it just drives me bananas.

[02:33] If you want to work, work.

[02:35] If you want to take off, take off.

[02:36] Just don't listen to what anyone else says about what you should do for your life.

[02:39] You're going to die and so will that.

[02:41] And it's not going to matter.

[02:42] And in 10 generations don't even remember your name.

[02:44] So do what you want.

[02:45] You're going to die.

[02:46] And that is the ultimate freedom.

[02:47] And for some reason we live under these chains that we think exist, but don't.

[02:50] And so I think the process of growing and really making ourselves free is just simply identifying

[02:55] the things that don't really exist and only exist in our mind to begin with.

[02:58] And I think that's why self-care really bugs the shit out of me or the self-suff-care movement.

[03:02] It's also soft as fuck.

[03:03] Like, just work.

[03:05] Right?

[03:05] To get it done, you need to like give yourself a fucking bubble bath every day,

[03:08] because like your work's so hard.

[03:10] Like, humans have been here very long time.

[03:12] We've dealt with much, much harder shit.

[03:14] You're, you know, boss having a deadline the next day

[03:16] is not the worst shit that you've been through.

[03:18] And so as a final sign off on this,

[03:20] think about the hardest things that you've been through in your life.

[03:23] Everyone has gone through hardship.

[03:24] Everyone has had difficulties in childhood.

[03:26] Everyone has had difficulties with siblings, with parents,

[03:29] blah, blah, blah, blah, these events that shape our lives.

[03:32] You have been through harder shit than this.

[03:34] You will survive.

[03:35] It will be okay.

[03:36] You don't need to self-care.

[03:37] You don't need to listen to what anyone else is saying.

[03:39] You do you.

[03:40] And if that means self-care by all means,

[03:42] but just don't project your own anyone else.

[03:43] All right, lots of love, those are your nation.

[03:44] See you guys in the next video.

[03:45] Bye!

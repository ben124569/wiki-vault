[00:00] If you want to make more profit than 99% of businesses, you need to nail pricing.

[00:04] Optimizing pricing has a six times stronger increase on profitability than getting more customers

[00:11] and two times stronger increase of profitability than decreasing turn or getting people to buy more times.

[00:17] And it is the strongest way for businesses to make more money.

[00:22] And so in this video, I will walk you through on each page that I turn, a new concept that you can apply to your business

[00:28] that will make it more profitable via pricing.

[00:30] If you don't know who I am, my name is Alcrimosi.

[00:31] I am an acquisition.com to provide companies that are over $200 million a year.

[00:35] And these videos are to help you show what we do to grow our portfolios so that you can make lots of money.

[00:40] And then maybe someday we can invest in your company.

[00:41] Otherwise, enjoy.

[00:42] I take a weekly call with school communities in the school group.

[00:47] And I had like three or four guys who asked me questions that I was like, these are not like Alex questions.

[00:53] These are math questions that you can just simply solve by doing math.

[00:58] And so it's like should I do this price or this price?

[01:00] It's like, well, what's the conversion of this one versus this one?

[01:03] And then what's LTV on this one?

[01:05] Right?

[01:05] It's just you just solve the math problem.

[01:07] And I think a lot of businesses are not using math to solve their problems.

[01:11] And with pricing being one of the largest levers for making money, not one of it is the largest compared to getting more customers.

[01:18] Increasing how many times people buy.

[01:21] And pricing is still a three times stronger lever on profit versus the other two.

[01:28] Let's talk about five concepts of pricing that will make you more money.

[01:32] All right.

[01:33] So the first one is something that I like to call the price-to-value discrepancy.

[01:38] All right.

[01:38] And so if we imagine here as the value, this little first red line,

[01:44] this is the value that the person gets.

[01:46] This is our price-to-suming that our price doesn't change over time.

[01:51] Now, if our price doesn't change and the value does, when will people cancel?

[01:56] Here, when the price and the value are matched or when it's underneath.

[02:00] And this is our sad face as business owners because we're like,

[02:03] oh my god, I thought that I was making all this money.

[02:06] And so the thing is that there's a third line here that is probably worth understanding.

[02:11] Do, do, do, do.

[02:12] And this is our cost line.

[02:14] So ideally, you want your cost to be here, your price to be here.

[02:18] So this is your profit.

[02:20] And then over here, this is your something called customer surplus.

[02:26] Which is just a fancy word of saying, goodwill or the value that people are getting,

[02:29] net of the price.

[02:30] Right? So ideally, you have really high value.

[02:32] You've got a price that's still high relative to your cost basis as a business owner.

[02:36] And so this is the fundamental surprising and a visual.

[02:39] Now, one of the things that I see is a mistake is how does this occur?

[02:44] How do we go from having lots of value to not having lots of value?

[02:47] Well, let me explain.

[02:49] So with one time value versus consumable value, which is I like to think about it.

[02:54] So the reason that you have those big discrepancies is that usually you don't understand

[03:01] the value that you are delivering to a customer.

[03:05] Meaning, if I say, hey, let me give you this course on building websites,

[03:13] whatever, then as soon as you learn how to build websites, the value of that course drops to zero.

[03:20] You already have the skill. Like the day before you needed to learn how to do arithmetic,

[03:24] arithmetic is super valuable. The day after you learn it, it has zero additional value.

[03:28] Now that doesn't detract from what the initial value was, it just no longer has value.

[03:33] And so what most business owners should do, but don't do so, this is me telling you that you might want to

[03:38] think about this, is differentiating the value that you have in your business between one time

[03:45] and consumable or recurring value. All right. So let me explain. So let's say, let's use that

[03:54] example of the websites. So my little course on website building is something that would be one time

[04:01] value. Once you have it, that's it. There's nothing else. But what are all the things that I might

[04:08] have in my business for website building? That someone is going to consume this month and next month

[04:13] and the month after. I might have a community that's associated with people who are trying to build

[04:19] pages. That's something that I'll use this month and next month. I might have a accountability.

[04:23] If I have somebody who's going to help me build it, right? Accountability slash support.

[04:28] That's something that I'll use this month and next month, right? I'll have access to those things.

[04:32] What else would I use? Probably website servers to host my site, right? I probably use software

[04:40] to host my site. I probably, what else would I use? I might want ads help, right? That I would

[04:49] use on a monthly basis to help optimize my ads, right? And so the big thing here is that we have to

[04:54] look at the services we provide and this is especially true with education people because they have

[04:58] lots of one time value and very low recurring value is thinking, am I pricing these things appropriately?

[05:03] So, hear me out, I think that a superior pricing model better matches the price-developed

[05:10] description that you're shooting for on a regular basis. So it would make sense for me to charge

[05:16] more here, right? My price to be higher here and then it would make sense for my price to be

[05:20] did. Did it? Low or over here. So I continue to have this delta all the way through, right? And so

[05:27] the question is, how do you accomplish something like that? Well, what you do is you have something

[05:32] called a start-up or one time fee which is associated with the thing that has one time value

[05:38] and then you have a lower consumable or recurring billing thing that's associated with the consumable

[05:44] or recurring value. And this is fundamentally why I think there's so much churn in the media or

[05:49] education or information space is because people don't differentiate between those things but

[05:53] your customers sure do. And so the customer says, well, you want me to pay a thousand dollars a

[05:58] month for this course but I already learned how to do this and you want me to keep paying for it

[06:03] for 12 months even though I already went through it. Now you might make the argument, well,

[06:06] it's worth 12,000 dollars but you know what? As far as they're concerned today, it's worth nothing.

[06:11] And so this is why I like having this perception of, I have a one time payment upfront, that's higher

[06:18] and then I have a smaller payment that is done every month that reflects a price-developed

[06:24] discrepancy on these recurring consumable things. Now one of the things that people have a hard time with

[06:28] is realizing that this is significantly less valuable than this. And so what happens is that this

[06:34] might have to be five thousand dollars and this might be three hundred dollars per month or two hundred

[06:39] dollars per month and that's okay. And so making sure that that price-developed discrepancy matches

[06:45] will allow you to have really long LTV on this side and so in so doing get way more LTV overall

[06:51] because people don't leave and if people don't leave they keep paying if they keep paying you can

[06:54] keep making money. Okay, now that is the one time value versus consumer valuable concept. This is

[07:00] the big headlong tail which I talked about in my office book in more depth and I think a lot of

[07:05] businesses are going to start switching to it they already are the way that this is done in the

[07:09] infocations people sell a course and then they have continuity or community on the back end and you

[07:14] sell it as one thing but they're just priced differently. So you pay five thousand dollars today

[07:19] but then you pay x dollars per month over time. Okay, now if you were to switch to something like this

[07:25] let me walk you through something that blew my mind that might blow yours as well. So profit

[07:30] well did a really cool study on this would show the difference between monthly billing,

[07:36] quarterly billing and annual billing. Now you're like okay well what's the point who cares?

[07:45] Well you should care let me show you why. So if you build monthly the average turn across all

[07:51] membership is about 10.7% per month. It means if you have 100 people you're going to have 89 at the end of

[07:58] the next month. All right. If you build quarterly that turn drops to 5%. Okay, less than half

[08:06] literally simply by changing the billing cadence. Now what happens if you build annually? It drops

[08:12] all the way to 2%. Now you're like okay that doesn't seem like a very big difference but let me show

[08:17] you how big of a difference this really is. So we can determine LTV by taking price and by the way

[08:24] you all wanted more real business shit. This is real business shit. Okay, so you take price and you

[08:30] divide by churn and this gives you your back of napkin LTV. All right meaning lifetime value how

[08:36] much somebody's worth over time. And so that means that if my price is a hundred dollars all right

[08:41] a hundred dollars and we'll use that for all three of these examples per month right?

[08:48] Now if it's a hundred dollars per month here of billing monthly here in billing 300 dollars of

[08:53] recorder here in billing a $1200 per year. All right just to be clear. Now these churn rates are

[08:59] extrapolated back out to monthly. So if I have 10.7% churn 10.7 then it means that my LTV is somewhere in

[09:08] the neighborhood of like nine hundred and fifty bucks somewhere there okay. Now if I have five percent

[09:13] churn my LTV is now two thousand dollars. If I have two percent churn my LTV is five thousand dollars.

[09:22] Wow so we went from nine fifty to five thousand just by changing the cadence that we build.

[09:29] If you're listening to this and you're like wait a second if I made five times the money per

[09:34] customer guess what that would do to my business you bet it would five extra business.

[09:39] Then you're like okay well I'm going to do this tomorrow not so fast there you know fast Fred.

[09:46] Let's talk about the other side of this two things real quick one if you like this stuff

[09:51] the question that I was setting at the very beginning of this was from a school Q&A that I do so if you're

[09:56] getting into business you want to start a business you can join the school games 30 percent of

[09:59] people make their first dollar online very proud of that if they finished the first month of

[10:03] the school game so pretty cool there. If you already are a business owner and you like this more

[10:06] in-depth stuff in terms of like scaling the companies and increasing profit and EBITDA we have

[10:12] workshops that we just started offering at Acquis or not come at a headquarters in Vegas and so if

[10:17] you want to see if you qualify for one of those you can go to Acquis or not come hit scale and

[10:22] hopefully we'll talk to you then. conversion rates and so think of it like this let's say you get a hundred

[10:29] clicks or at bats or whatever it pitched this thick right now before this used to say hey my thing is

[10:36] $12,000 and you bill you know a thousand bucks a month for a year okay fine now the thing is this

[10:44] maybe you close 20 percent of people on this okay fine now let's say you have another hundred

[10:51] where you get on the phone and you say for these guys it's $5,000 per year and it's up front now the

[11:00] question is what percent maybe you still sell 20 percent I don't know this is a testable proposition

[11:06] but this is where it gets really interesting is that for everybody who knows that you you say hey this

[11:10] is $12,000 the thousand a month for 12 months we all know that this person cancels at month four

[11:15] you know what I'm saying so they can't slip month four five which means the people are worth $4,000

[11:23] right now if you bill $5,000 and you bill it annually and you say hey you have to pay this up front

[11:29] maybe you have the same closure because the price point is so much the perception of the price is so much

[11:33] lower but here's where this gets really interesting is that if we look at this 12 months later and we say hey

[11:39] what percentage of these people are going to renew guess what the percentages weigh higher and that

[11:45] brings me to my next point which I will reiterate back on this one which is let's think about what the

[11:50] mechanism is that drives down this churn going from monthly to quarterly to annual so let me tell you

[11:56] what it is or at least my best thought of it is that churn is directly correlated with frequency of

[12:07] billing okay so here we out if I bill you every day the likely that you churn is going to be significantly

[12:15] higher than if I bill you every month and I believe that that comes down to what I consider the

[12:20] look back window so think about it like this if I have a month right or a period between billing one

[12:27] and billing two doesn't really matter what this period of time is on this point I'm going to look

[12:32] back with my eyeballs and say how much value did I get between this billing and this bill

[12:37] now if I'm billing monthly then let's say I'm an SEO agency and I make someone 10x there are

[12:44] money on month one great month two happens let's say I make them one x guess what they're going to do

[12:51] they're not going to think oh well he I 10x my money on month one this guy's already paid for

[12:56] himself for almost the whole year no they're going to think well I got a good return last month

[13:00] and I got a crap return this month it's so many cancel it's about what if you done for me

[13:04] lately it's about what have you done in the look back window between billing cycles the reason that

[13:10] this frequency piece that I was mentioning earlier is so important is it extends the look back period

[13:14] and so if I paid five thousand dollars a year to be a part of an association and then it comes

[13:18] up to bill a year later that I might think to myself huh I look back over a year and say did I make

[13:25] more than five thousand dollars now that 10x month is going to be included in the one x month

[13:30] and the next month that was a three x and the next month that's a one x the next month that's

[13:34] a 15x all of those months are going to be included and I'm going to be like wow this is a

[13:37] bang and deal right and so for that reason extending the look back window gives you a higher likely

[13:43] the people are going to renew and we already see that it's five times more likely that people

[13:46] were new on any of your bases now you can make it also the argument somebody can pay a fee up front

[13:50] can also afford to do it so they're not just scrimping by to try and barely afford whatever the

[13:55] services and so it's probably a number of reasons that annual does better than monthly or quarterly

[14:01] but for me as a consumer I think to myself I think about what's this look back window and I

[14:06] want it to be as long as you really possible for someone to logically say this makes sense for me

[14:12] okay so from there I have made a number of conclusions for myself that I'd like for you to fit

[14:20] consider oops that you can consider for your business all right which is the difference if this is

[14:29] kind of counter-init marketing culture which is originally you want to say you want to sell it for

[14:33] as much as you possibly can which I used to preach and I don't believe that as much anymore and I

[14:40] actually would much rather pitch something that I know they're going to continue to pay for right

[14:45] and so I spent the first part of my career trying to obsess about what gets people to stick how

[14:51] to get people to pay get and again and again and where I have switched to in my careers I just look

[14:56] for things that people already don't cancel from and then I just try and sell those and so if I

[15:02] could do it all over again I would only focus exclusively on things that people already don't cancel

[15:07] so if you look at alarm systems and insurance and payment processing and banking and other things

[15:12] like that you're going to find things that people in general don't cancel or switch from cable right

[15:17] like people don't switch from these things uh cell phone service like these are things that people

[15:21] really switch a very often on the flip side gym membership so something that people cancel all the

[15:25] time and that's a structural thing people don't want to work out but people do need insurance people

[15:30] do need to watch television people do need to use their phones even more and so I would take all

[15:37] of my emphasis and say why don't I just get into the right boat that already know has really long

[15:41] out TV and so that's something that I've just learned in time now now the other piece is I would

[15:48] strongly emphasize the point that I was making earlier about looking at quarter annual and monthly

[15:54] is that I would rather take less money on an annual billing and convert it the same percentage so

[16:01] it's like if it's 12k for a year versus 5k paid up front for a year I'd rather have the five because

[16:07] I know that my annual renewal rate will be much higher so let's let's finish out this uh this little

[16:14] little equation here so here if this $5,000 is what I'm asking for someone to pay for a year

[16:21] and we have this look back a year later believe it or not remember we have 2% a lot of times this

[16:27] means you're going to keep 80% or more of the customers and so all of a sudden wait a second remember

[16:34] we had 2% monthly churn but this is a 5k thing well that means that this price point would be

[16:41] 5,000 divided by 12 can we do that math for me that's 600 bucks a month five hundred six hundred

[16:48] bucks a month five hundred bucks a month four sixty five four sixteen okay so four sixteen

[16:57] and then we multiply this guy by 50 because it's 2% churn right which means they have

[17:05] what is that that's going to be 20,000 something all right don't worry it's 2% churn

[17:12] so this is 2% which is equal this time's 50 same thing equals uh 20,000 800 all right the

[17:21] reason this is so important the reason this is so important is that look at the difference in this 20,000

[17:27] and this four five thousand we have here now this means that a year from now you're going to have

[17:33] 80 out of the hundred people still paying you and then they renew again and guess what if you keep

[17:37] selling it this rate that means that you get all of last year's sales to stack on top of this

[17:42] and guess what happens in the third year you have last year's the year before is and this year's

[17:47] that stack on top of each other and so this is what creates a compounding business and the vast majority

[17:53] vast vast majority of small businesses do not understand this and the reason that they stay poor

[17:59] is because they think that the only way that they can grow their business is to increase the number of

[18:04] customers that they're selling every month and that simply is a very terrible way to live because

[18:09] the moment your acquisition channel your your YouTube channel gets shut down your Facebook out of

[18:14] account gets shut down you've got some sort of deliverability issue on your domains if you're doing

[18:18] outreach right there's always something that can happen and unless you have customers that plan

[18:22] on continuing to pay you over and over again it means your business dies immediately that's not a

[18:27] very valuable business it's also one that's hard to sleep with at night and so the idea is you want

[18:33] to find stuff that people don't stop buying you want to sell the crap out of it you want to sell it

[18:37] at a price point that you know they're going to continue to pay you want to extend the look back

[18:41] window as much as you possibly can so it increases the likely that they're going to convert and you

[18:45] also have a bidirectional relationship between the price and the conversion rate and so maybe you do

[18:52] get more people to buy to thousand dollars down then you do it five grand upfront but on the flip side

[18:57] five thousand dollars is less than twelve thousand dollars for the year it's so you're going to have

[19:00] two forces are going to be working against each other now for me personally I would rather have

[19:05] the much higher quality customer that's going to be in the most optimized billing cycle and if I do

[19:10] think about this with my thinking hat maybe I either do the big headlong tail which is if I know my

[19:15] thing isn't tremendously valuable then I might say my one-time upfront that offsets my cost to a

[19:20] car customers and then I have a very small monthly billing after that that has a big price

[19:24] to value discrepancy based on the consumer value of my service or thing or I know that my value is

[19:31] high and it is high on a recurring basis but it's volatile meaning some months it's big some

[19:35] months it's not big this is particularly true of things like ads or organic like if you have

[19:40] something that goes you know viral one month it's going to make a lot of money for them if it

[19:43] doesn't go viral the next month and it doesn't now some of these things you can't control and so

[19:47] by having an extended look back window it increases the likely that something good happens during

[19:51] that time period increases likely that they will bill again in the future and so the TLDR for you

[19:57] number one separate out one time versus consumable value and then if you can do that you can switch

[20:08] to the big headlong tail pricing model which is one time upfront and then small recurring the

[20:13] alternative is that you can consider increasing the look back window right between when people

[20:19] see value and when they get value there's a little eyeball looking back about the money and so

[20:24] what we can do is trying to switch to annual to the best degree possible and billing based on what

[20:30] you think someone is going to continue to pay for what they're going to pay for on their worst

[20:33] month rather than what you can as much as you can get them to say yes to today and this is

[20:38] something that I've switched to over time the third thing is make sure that you're in the right

[20:42] boat and when I say that what I mean is instead of trying to obsess about getting people to buy more

[20:46] times go to stuff that people already don't cancel and you'll be amazed at how much easier it

[20:54] is to do business and how those things stack on top of one another by the way if you're wondering

[20:59] why my eyes look back and forth between things except three things I'm looking at one is I have

[21:04] a bunch of notes because I do prepare these for you guys because I want to just like be off the cuff

[21:07] and just rambling uh second is that I do these with Instagram lives and so those are on a separate

[21:12] camera than the YouTube camera and I try to look at the YouTube camera but I also have a hard time

[21:16] not looking at the audience that's on Instagram live and so if you see my is starting back and forth that's

[21:21] why so now we'll transition to questions from the audience the question is one is how do I know how to

[21:25] raise my price because of things like inflation and how do I just raise my price in general if I've

[21:30] been in business for a period of time all right so those are two separate questions I'll answer

[21:33] each of them individually so from an inflation perspective every continuity contract I would include

[21:38] a clause that says that you can match the CPI or the you know it's a consumer price index that allows

[21:44] YouTube map up the price with inflation that's up to you now having that clause doesn't mean necessarily

[21:50] mean that you have to always do it every month or every year but it means every two or three years

[21:55] you can just update your pricing accordingly people don't like pricing changes and so I would do it

[21:59] less frequently rather than more frequently so that's number one in terms of inflation in terms of

[22:05] thinking about one to raise prices in general I encourage everyone to continue to raise prices until

[22:10] your conversion rate times price equal less money meaning if I can sell now again this doesn't

[22:16] take into account hard costs all right so I'm just going to assume that the cost of our thing is

[22:22] zero let's say it's a it's a digital media thing just for sake of simplicity so if I can sell

[22:27] if I get on the phone with a hundred people and I can sell 10 people at ten thousand dollars

[22:32] I have a you know 10% conversion rate which means I make a hundred thousand dollars from 100

[22:36] calls it's a thousand bucks a call now if I can all of a sudden get to 30% close rate with a

[22:44] five thousand dollar thing then it means that I make a hundred fifty thousand dollars on those hundred

[22:49] calls and so then I would make 1500 bucks per call and so I try and level out the cost per or revenue per

[22:58] phone call or conversation so that I can understand what's the total amount of money that I'm making so it's

[23:02] not necessarily about raising prices or lower prices it's about what is the total absolute amount

[23:06] of gross profit you can maximize and so this is a math problem not a Alex which should I price it

[23:11] at problem and I will tell you exactly what we do with every company which is we just fucking

[23:15] test the price and so we get on the phone and we say and I will say this it's way easier to go

[23:19] low to higher than high to low all right and so if you if you sell at a price that's more expensive

[23:25] over time that works out okay if you if you go the other direction it can kind of suck and so

[23:32] I think going up because think about it you're like yeah well that's what I was selling it last month

[23:36] we have more demand now we're better at our stuff like it makes sense like if you bought a Apple

[23:40] stock at 10 and now it's 20 like around the upset like in time prices change now the flip side is

[23:45] when prices come down if you if you are in that position then the reason behind it would be useful

[23:51] to tell the other people but usually you're gonna have to downgrade those people if they're still

[23:55] in your business because if you did figure out some technological thing which would be probably

[23:59] your big reason why I'm like hey we figured out how to make this more efficient so we can lower the

[24:02] price we pass savings on to you then you have to pass savings on to them otherwise if you sold

[24:07] some of the last month at 20k in this month at 10k very tough if it's for the same thing and so that's

[24:12] why I like starting low and then raising it and then usually at the very end I'm gonna have to do

[24:17] tiny little adjustment of like okay I realized I went over the hump of maximizing my profit and so

[24:22] then I back step and then I refund these people the difference where I give them a bonus in practice

[24:27] most businesses will have a monthly and an either or quarterly or annual it's usually not one of the

[24:33] other and you'll probably know your avatar if if pre paying 12 months at a time is too

[24:40] our deus for them then it might it might be better to just have quarterly billing as the primary way

[24:46] and I would say that as I'm as I'm explaining this right now you might be able to just get away with

[24:50] pure quarterly billing and not have monthly or annual like you just do quarterly and that might be a

[24:56] kind of a nice blend for a lot of people as like the middle ground but it's very typical to have

[25:01] monthly at this rate annual at 16% less because it's you know by 10 get too free and by doing that though

[25:08] if you get people onto that annual remember you're giving them a 16% discount but the likely that

[25:13] those people occur and the LTV on those people still might be 10 to five times higher than these people

[25:18] so you take a 5x increase in LTV and then apply the 16% discount to the fact that's a lower price

[25:24] and then you'll get probably something closer to a you know four and a half x so it's still

[25:28] worth having that quote discount for the annual rate if you want to even incentivize people to go to the

[25:34] annual first off you have the discount so that's you know thing one and I like to associate as many

[25:40] benefits as humanly possible immediately for making the decision and so I want bad things I take away

[25:46] so discounts would be a pricing thing that I'd have bad thing I take away and then I also want to

[25:50] add good things so it's like if I had a call to call to customer appreciation thing or I had

[25:57] I had specific times or sessions that only VIP customers so basically consider it like you

[26:03] give in name it something so it's like you have your standard near VIP even if it's the same pricing

[26:06] you'll get way more people to take because they want the status associated and then VIP get these

[26:11] other three benefits it's like they don't have to wait in line they can get the session times they

[26:16] want or we have a special Saturday session or Sunday session that's only for VIP and they get you

[26:20] know towel service whatever you just think about anything that's VIP two or three things that

[26:25] ideally give them status in the community for being a VIP which you have now associated with the

[26:32] annual billing which has the highest stick rate so not only you providing more value to these people

[26:36] they pay a little bit less and they get the status and that's okay because they pay four and a half

[26:40] times more over lifetime and so this is how you stack as much as you can in the annual

[26:45] so that you can just make a lot more money and the other really big benefit that I didn't hit on

[26:49] it all in the video that I should have is that annual if you do increase the conversion percentage there

[26:54] in a real way you're front loading a year of revenue meaning your ability to offset the cost to

[27:00] a car customer skyrocket because you get so much more cash collected at front so you can get

[27:04] really aggressive in the acquisition even if you have a small like let's say you convert half as many

[27:09] into the annual billing it's like okay well I get half as many but I get 10 times the upfront cash

[27:14] I still get five X upfront cash as I did before and to monthly and so if that's the case

[27:19] then I'm still crushing it the question is is it better to build up front versus build monthly

[27:25] and get the contract because then with that in theory the contract plus the lower rate would

[27:30] convert a higher percentage people and they do it extend the LTV so I'm going to give it two part

[27:34] answer to this number one is the contract that you lock someone in on is only worth the quality of

[27:40] the signature on the contract meaning the person or the prospect who buys it is their credit

[27:46] worthiness that matters now for example in Europe contracts matter a lot more and people actually

[27:52] adhere to that like it's there's not a really big you know turn rate on people saying that they

[27:57] don't make they don't stick with their commitments in the US it's just a different culture in terms

[28:01] of how credit and contracts work like people get out of and cancel contracts or ghost or cancel

[28:06] their credit cards all the time and this is because Visa and MasterCard in those companies

[28:11] have become a very pro consumer basically cover for people to not stick with their commitments

[28:18] because they will always side with the consumer on charge backs and refunds and so it allows people

[28:24] to make purchases without consequences and so I like the people where contracts matter is like

[28:31] enterprise customers if you have a massive company that you're doing business with contracts matter

[28:34] if you're dealing with like consumers contracts don't mean anything and if you look at the biggest

[28:38] companies that deal with consumers the vast majority don't even bother doing contracts because what

[28:41] ends up happening is that peaked it let me say it this way it will decrease sales to such a larger

[28:49] extent that just billing month to month and then focusing on improving the quality of the thing you

[28:54] have because at the end of the day if the contract doesn't matter either way all it does is decrease

[28:58] sales because people factor it in to their purchase but they don't factor it into their cancellation

[29:03] and so it's like you increase friction on the front end but you don't decrease friction on the back end

[29:08] now in general will someone who signs a contract stay longer than someone who is months a month

[29:13] yes but the question is what the trade-off on conversion and is it worth it versus taking all that effort

[29:19] and putting it into how do I improve the the quality of the product how to improve the

[29:25] quality of the prospect as well in terms of targeting and messaging but the big one is is there a

[29:30] way that I can just pick something that people already don't cancel the question was is there a way to

[29:35] extend the look back period beyond the billing cycle meaning can you accumulate saving time saving

[29:42] if you had a software or money made if you had an agency or anything to that degree or you

[29:47] know pounds lost if you did weight loss whatever you know marriage is saved you know fights

[29:50] avoided if you're in marriage counseling whatever um I think that the the best

[29:57] thought process that I'd have around this is yes I would try and report that data on a cumulative

[30:01] basis as much as evenly possible because then it allows me to at least try try and price or at least

[30:08] display my value relative to price on a longer time rising like hey you know we have brought you

[30:14] 35 thousand you know clicks to your website over the last six months now it doesn't like it might

[30:20] look like this in terms of the volatility might be up and down but if you look back

[30:26] cumulatively relative to what you paid it's still a you know a great deal and so I think that is

[30:30] where customer success and having some you know tech and how you're reporting and how you have

[30:36] this conversation with the customer is super important in terms of framing so I think there's

[30:39] a huge benefits to trying to show the cumulative increase but just being really real most people don't

[30:48] care that much I think it might lift you a few points but the big biggest it's still gonna

[30:52] think well you know you build me last month and this month I only got one accident it's not worth it

[30:56] for example if you look at instacart they say we saved you this many hours of going shopping

[31:01] and driving or whatever and so it is over the duration of the time that you've had instacart they

[31:06] will show you what your savings are not what I saved you this month hey if you like this more

[31:11] mathematical approach business by the way this is how I actually do business that's not the

[31:15] YouTube version and the reason that these videos will always get fewer views is because it's actually

[31:19] for business owners that being said one of my favorite videos that I've ever made is seven equations

[31:25] that will make you money it is four business owners that want to make money you have to know these

[31:30] equations I do them in every business that I invest in like watch it memorite like you should

[31:36] know these like they you should know them like the back of your hand it shouldn't just like

[31:38] memorize them like you should understand them because that's how you will ultimately make a lot more

[31:43] money in your business by looking at a like an investor and investing accordingly

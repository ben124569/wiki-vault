[00:00] Every week, Leila and I, my wife, talked to five to ten new companies to potentially invest

[00:05] in that have already passed a couple rounds of screening.

[00:07] And I was on a conversation the other day with a coaching business and the founder made

[00:12] a very ridiculous statement and I thought I would make a video about it because I think

[00:16] you will get a lot of value from it.

[00:18] They made the statement, I just don't think there's a way that we can make our customers

[00:21] more valuable, which as you can imagine if you've been following my channel for a while,

[00:25] drove me into a fit of rage, not really.

[00:28] But I stopped and I wish I had recorded it.

[00:30] But the basic premise is that that's just patently false and I'll show you six different

[00:34] ways you can increase lifetime value in a coaching or service based business.

[00:39] All right.

[00:40] And so if you don't know how I am, my name is Oximozi, I'm an acquisition.com.

[00:42] It's a portfolio of companies that right now it has about a hundred and ten million dollars

[00:45] a year and continuing to grow.

[00:47] And so I just make these videos because I hope you give value from them.

[00:52] Okay.

[00:53] So there are two ways that you grow business.

[00:55] Number one is you get more customers.

[00:56] The second is you make them more and more.

[00:58] That's it.

[00:59] That's chunked all the way up at the top of this, right?

[01:00] Like either get more customers, you make them more and more.

[01:02] All right.

[01:03] There's lots of sub buckets underneath of that, but those are the two fundamentals.

[01:06] If you're attacking a business in terms of trying to figure out how you want to grow

[01:09] your own business, you can use these mental frameworks.

[01:12] And so these are kind of like my own checklist of what I'm thinking through as someone

[01:15] was talking because we only have 15 to 20 minutes with these new companies because we

[01:18] talked to a lot of them just to get a feel if we want to invest time to money into them.

[01:22] So that being said, with this particular company, it was a coaching business.

[01:25] Now the nice thing is that with coaching businesses, it really applies to all types of

[01:29] businesses.

[01:30] So if you're a service based business, if you coach for weight loss, that is a service

[01:33] business.

[01:34] If you, you know, a lot of businesses just don't like the term coaching, but it is more

[01:37] or less what you're doing, you're advising clients on some sort of outcome, right?

[01:40] And so in this particular business, they said that they didn't have a way of, you know,

[01:44] making the customer more valuable.

[01:46] And so these are the six ways that you can make a customer more valuable.

[01:49] And I'll give the example that I shared with them to try to drive it home.

[01:52] All right.

[01:53] So if you can think about this within your own business, you will make more money.

[01:55] So the first and obvious one is that you can raise prices.

[01:57] So you can sell the exact same thing and add money to it and make more money.

[02:01] Sounds wild, but that is something that a lot of people don't do.

[02:03] And so getting the pricing right is a way of making more money.

[02:06] There are sub-paces that we could sell higher percentage of people by having different pricing

[02:10] levels, but just big picture.

[02:12] Number one is you can increase the price.

[02:14] Number two is that you can lower the cost of goods, right?

[02:17] Because we're looking at how can we make a customer more valuable?

[02:19] We can make that by raising the price, but we can also lower how much it costs to fulfill

[02:23] on them.

[02:24] There's two easy ways you can do this within a coaching business.

[02:26] One is that you could decrease the cost of the people themselves.

[02:30] So you keep the ratio that you have with your clients.

[02:32] But then you probably outsource a component of that.

[02:34] You know, it's somebody who might be abroad, who'd be willing to work for less money.

[02:37] All right.

[02:38] That would be a way of decreasing the cost of goods.

[02:39] The other way of decreasing the cost of goods is keeping the same number of coaches,

[02:42] but increasing the ratio between coaches to clients.

[02:45] If one coach is managing 10 clients and then they go to managing 20 clients, your cost of goods

[02:49] cuts in half.

[02:50] And in so doing that, your margin goes up.

[02:52] Hopefully you're tracking with me.

[02:54] So number one, increase the price.

[02:55] Number two, decrease the cost of goods.

[02:57] Number three, increase the purchase velocity of your frequencies.

[03:00] The number times people buy.

[03:01] All right.

[03:02] And so within the context of a recurring revenue business, that would be decreasing

[03:05] churn, that would getting people to stick and stay and pay longer.

[03:09] Right.

[03:10] So if somebody normally buys and then stays for three months in your service based business

[03:13] or coaching business or whatever it is, then if we can get them to stay, just an additional

[03:17] month, it's a 25% increase in LTV.

[03:19] So how much that person is worth to us over the lifetime of them being with us.

[03:23] And so number one, price two, cost of goods.

[03:25] Number three, getting them to buy more times.

[03:28] The other whole next three buckets all kind of fall.

[03:32] They're different flavors of the same thing.

[03:33] All right.

[03:34] And so it's cross-cells, upsells, and downsells.

[03:35] And so I'll give examples of each of those.

[03:37] So cross-cells is when you have them buy something and then buy a different thing as

[03:43] an add-on.

[03:44] All right.

[03:45] So if you have a level of service, let's say you have a coaching business.

[03:47] Right.

[03:48] Because I'm using the example that we were talking about.

[03:49] If they have a core service, but there's an element of something that someone needs to

[03:54] do.

[03:55] So let's say they're doing some sort of business coaching.

[03:56] Right.

[03:57] A lot of times, they're going to have some sort of model that they're helping people

[04:00] execute within their business or for flip-to.

[04:03] And then there's sub-components of the execution.

[04:05] So there might be creating ads.

[04:07] That would be an add-on service that you could add.

[04:10] It could be drilling their sales team.

[04:12] Right.

[04:13] So helping them train their sales or train themselves on sales because they need that additional

[04:17] level of support.

[04:18] And so just think about the different bottlenecks that people are experiencing within the

[04:21] execution of the core business that not necessarily everyone will use, but some people would

[04:25] get a tremendous amount of value from.

[04:27] Those are kind of perfect scenarios for add-ons that you could add to the service levels

[04:31] that will increase the lifetime value because let's say 20% of people take an up-sell,

[04:36] you know, if an extra $1,000 a month and they're paying $1,000 a month.

[04:38] Well, just like that, you took your average monthly from $1,000 to $1,200.

[04:43] Right.

[04:44] And increase because you got 20% of people to take an additional level of service.

[04:48] All right.

[04:49] The second type of sell here, so I said there's six ways we've covered four price

[04:52] cost of goods, increasing purchase frequency, cross sales.

[04:55] The next one is upsells.

[04:56] All right.

[04:57] So I like to delineate this from cross sales.

[04:59] Cross sells is selling a different thing to the same customer.

[05:02] All right.

[05:03] So in the McDonald's version, this is like, would you like fries with your Coke, right?

[05:06] Or whatever.

[05:07] It's fries with your burger doesn't matter, but like it's the cross-elev.

[05:10] So it's something different that still goes with the core thing.

[05:12] And upsell is where you sell more of the thing that they just bought.

[05:16] So this is where I'll use the McDonald's and I'll give you a coaching example.

[05:21] So in the McDonald's example, that's what you like.

[05:23] You want a burger, do you want a bigger burger, right?

[05:26] That would be an upsell, right?

[05:27] It's the same, but more of the same thing.

[05:29] And it's good to think through these frameworks because this is how you can think of and

[05:34] iterate your own service levels within the business.

[05:37] So let's say that somebody in this coaching business meets with their coach, every, whatever.

[05:42] Every, every two weeks.

[05:44] We could increase that frequency and say, okay, well, you, like, our higher level of service,

[05:49] you can meet with the coach more times, right?

[05:51] Or you could have, it's more access.

[05:53] Whatever the thing that we're selling is it's just more of it.

[05:55] And you'd be surprised a lot of people just want more.

[05:59] And this is where this is kind of interesting from a, from a pricing and, and, and life's

[06:03] my value perspective, customers were fractal.

[06:05] And what that means is that it's 80, 20.

[06:07] So one out of five customers is typically willing to pay twice as much as the core offer.

[06:11] That continues to go up.

[06:12] So if, you know, if you have 100 people, 20 of them were willing to pay five times, you

[06:16] know, as much as the base 80 are, which then means that if you get 20% to take something

[06:22] that's five times as expensive, then you actually just double the lifetime value.

[06:25] Now if you look at that 20 and look again and do another 80, 20 split on that, then four of

[06:31] those 20 are going to be willing to pay another five times more than the remaining 16 in

[06:35] that group, right?

[06:36] 80, 20.

[06:37] And so it continues to get fractal.

[06:38] It's like 80, 20, 95, 5, 99, 1.

[06:42] All of those are fractal distributions.

[06:45] And with each of those increments, usually have people who have significantly higher spending

[06:49] power.

[06:50] And so simply offering a significantly more expensive version to 20% of the customers

[06:55] is typically really good way of increasing LTV.

[06:57] All right.

[06:58] And so in this coaching example, if they had a large group component and they wanted to do

[07:02] a semi-private component or small group, then that would be something that should reasonably

[07:07] be probably four or five times as expensive given the fact that it's now significantly

[07:12] more narrow and more attention is given each customer.

[07:15] All right.

[07:16] So increase the price, increase the cost of goods, get people to buy more times, sell

[07:20] them more stuff that's different, sell them more of the same, all right, cross-sells, up-sells.

[07:25] And the last one, number six is down-sells.

[07:27] All right.

[07:28] So this is when, and the purpose of the down-sell, there's kind of two key areas in

[07:32] the business where this is helpful.

[07:33] Number one is on the front end, number two is on the back end.

[07:35] All right.

[07:36] So on the front end, getting more down-sells, it's, I'll tell you where it, where it back

[07:40] fires.

[07:41] But if you have another offering for people who get on the phone, it's especially useful.

[07:46] And this is how you do it right.

[07:47] For disqualified or underqualified leads, all right, because you've already paid for the

[07:51] marketing to get this person on the phone or into your kind of conversion event.

[07:55] But if the person does not qualify for your core offer, because they don't meet certain,

[08:00] you know, requirements that you've already predefined of like what a perfect customer is

[08:04] for you, then you want to have

[08:05] something for them that can help them ascend into that.

[08:08] That's going to be significantly lower touch or ideally no touch at all, right.

[08:13] And so in this instance, I think this was a health coaching thing.

[08:16] They, as I just create a done for you at home or done, do it yourself at home program,

[08:20] that people who can't afford to have the level of service, they get a little bit of a

[08:24] head start, they get a little bit of education to get them going so that they can then,

[08:27] you know, if they succeed with that, they show themselves their motivator, they,

[08:29] they show themselves this is more valuable than they can ascend up.

[08:32] Where it gets sticky is where you have people who otherwise would have bought the core offer,

[08:36] but then the sales team starts down selling them.

[08:38] That's the no-no.

[08:39] That's what you don't want to have happen.

[08:41] And that's why tracking before you make an implement a downsell into your sales process

[08:46] is important, because you can see the percentage of people who were buying the core offer.

[08:48] And so we should just simply be adding on more sales without attracting from the amount

[08:52] of people who were buying the core offer.

[08:54] The second way that we protect against this is that when you have the customer requirements,

[08:58] if someone meets the customer requirements for your core offer,

[09:01] they should never be presented the downsell.

[09:02] That is my opinion, that's how I prefer to do it.

[09:04] Because it also keeps it black and white for the sales team,

[09:06] because you don't want to have gray in making sales decisions in my opinion.

[09:10] I think it's much easier to say like, if they are this, sell this, if they are not this,

[09:14] sell this.

[09:15] That way we're just treating the customer for what is best for them,

[09:18] rather than trying to like go based on their budget.

[09:20] This is me personally, because I just want to say like,

[09:22] if I'm going to make this promise to you, I'm going to fulfill this promise to you,

[09:25] period.

[09:25] And if we need to find a way for you to get the resources to do it,

[09:29] then we will help you do that.

[09:30] But like we're not going to just give you a deluded version of what we had.

[09:32] Right.

[09:33] And so it's only like if you do not qualify,

[09:35] then and only then will we downsell.

[09:37] The reason this is effective is that you have these people you've already paid to get on the phone.

[09:41] And so if you can liquidate a certain percentage of that cost by having it downsell,

[09:45] it will help you offset cost of acquisition and also make some more money.

[09:48] And you also get more customers because those people have potential to send in the future,

[09:52] which is a great thing.

[09:53] Now, the other place where downsells help is actually on the back end.

[09:56] So information to clients and value over time, right?

[09:59] And a lot of businesses that we work with are e-learning,

[10:01] service coaching, et cetera, types of businesses.

[10:04] And so one of the difficulties is how did they attack turn?

[10:08] And so part of the way of attacking turn is realizing how people are consuming value

[10:13] through the services that they offer, right?

[10:15] And so if someone, you know, the day before you learn something very important,

[10:18] it's incredibly valuable.

[10:19] The day after it, you don't need to learn it again, you already have it.

[10:22] So the value declines very, very precipitously in these types of businesses,

[10:26] which is what we've spent our life kind of fixing and making them more valuable, right?

[10:30] But having a downsell component on the back end when people are like,

[10:33] you know what, I've gotten a lot from this,

[10:35] you know, I don't need the training and all that kind of stuff anymore.

[10:37] What the question is, what do they need?

[10:39] Or what would they like to keep?

[10:41] Right? And a lot of times, community access is something that people will continue to pay for,

[10:45] even though they're not access to the information anymore,

[10:47] because like they don't need it because they're already figured it out, right?

[10:50] Or certain levels of troubleshooting and support, whether it be technical support,

[10:54] or accountability levels, or those are things that are consumable, right?

[10:57] In terms of like, you might need to be held accountable last month,

[11:00] and you need to be held accountable this month,

[11:02] on tours doing the actions.

[11:03] And so when we think about this and we're looking at a business,

[11:06] and this was the coaching business that I gave you,

[11:08] in example, hopefully those answers give you some light depending on what type of business you have.

[11:12] But there are always ways to make a cost are more valuable over time.

[11:17] And so those are the six that I think through,

[11:20] when I'm looking at any kind of coaching info service type business,

[11:23] that we're looking to take on, which is like,

[11:25] where do we see opportunity that we can increase the LTV per customer?

[11:28] So that we can then turn around and spend to get more customers on the fund.

[11:32] Right? Because if we're talking back up,

[11:33] two ways to make more money,

[11:35] get more customers, make them worth more, and that is a wrap.

[11:39] So thank you guys.

[11:40] Appreciate, if you're new to it,

[11:41] most of you nation welcome.

[11:42] I appreciate you, and I'll see you guys in the next video.

[11:44] Bye!

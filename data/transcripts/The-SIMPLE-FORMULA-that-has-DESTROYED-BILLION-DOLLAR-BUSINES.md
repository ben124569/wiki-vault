[00:00] Welcome to Mozi Nation. In this video, I'm going to be sharing with you the three most important

[00:03] lines that you need to draw in your business that you probably are not. And I want to show you

[00:08] some different combinations of these lines and how dramatically will impact how much money

[00:14] you make and ultimately the value of the company that you ultimately build. So if you don't know

[00:18] my name is Alex Ramoziao and acquisition.com, we do about $85 million a year. This is a

[00:24] bonus sponsored episode. So if I'm less chipper than normal, that is why we think our

[00:30] sponsors as always. And so these are the three lines that I think everyone needs to understand.

[00:35] All right. So line number one right here. I'm going to make sure that you guess, so if you can,

[00:39] guess right now, which of these lines are going to represent. You have price, you have value,

[00:45] and you have cost of goods. All right. So every line has every business has these three lines

[00:51] within everything that they sell. You have how much you sell it for. You have how much value

[00:55] the person gets and you have what it costs you. And what I want to show you is a mental framework

[01:01] in the interplay between these things and how dramatically you can shift your business. So this

[01:06] is the value line. This is what they are getting. This is the price line. This is how much you charge.

[01:12] This is the cost of goods line, which is how much it costs you to fulfill on this value. Right?

[01:20] Right. Okay. So here's where it gets kind of cool. If we move our price up,

[01:28] see how little value we have here? This means that we have a low customer surplus.

[01:34] Customer surplus is the excess between what they pay and what they get. The higher the surplus,

[01:42] the greater the distance between these two things here, the more value they will perceive that they

[01:46] have gotten from your services. The bigger this discrepancy is, the more viral your business will be.

[01:54] Imagine there was a day years and years ago where you could have access to everything in the entire

[02:00] blockbuster store on demand from the comfort of your home and you could do it for less than it

[02:05] costs to do a new release and to run a new release. Wouldn't that be amazing? Well, they did create

[02:13] and that was called Netflix. And so what they did was they priced it so low, but their cost of goods

[02:18] was still low or because the cost of the incremental cost of adding a single customer was basically nothing.

[02:25] Right? And so their gross margins here is still very high because for them, they could still

[02:32] lower these things even more. And so what I'm going to tell you at the end of this video is that the trick

[02:37] to how you actually can build a fortune simply understanding the interplay between these three lines.

[02:42] If I have one takeaway for everybody who's watching this is that if you can think about your

[02:46] business just using these three lines, then you will be able to build a fortune. If we have here

[02:52] our cost of goods at the bottom and we raise this all the way to here and we have a ton of customer

[03:03] surplus, what kind of business is this? This is going to be a business that probably doesn't

[03:08] need a market very much. This is going to be a business that is probably operationally difficult,

[03:14] probably a service based business and probably runs on very thin margins. Many businesses run like this.

[03:19] These are a lot of old school businesses that grow consistently every year by 10% 15% per year

[03:26] and they don't have a ton of money to reinvest in resources. They're very operationally efficient

[03:30] in order to run a business like this. That's business scenario one. Let's see if you can guess

[03:35] for type of business this would be. So this is most of your generic mom and pop businesses.

[03:42] Decent margin, let's say this is the baseline here. Sorry, there's our baseline. Decent margins,

[03:48] here, decent margins, decent value, just kind of another run in the mill business. Nothing

[03:56] underwhelming or overwhelming about this business and this is what most businesses operate like.

[04:01] So let me tell you what type of business I would like to try and create. My goal is always to find

[04:06] away to bribe something that's excessively valuable that costs me almost nothing to make.

[04:13] Unique expensive stickier for those you know, guys who know that channel, that one of that video,

[04:18] that's one of favorites. I want something that costs almost nothing, provides tremendous value

[04:23] and creates a big customer surplus. And here's what's crazy. The bigger you do this,

[04:30] discrepancy, the more viral your business will become. For me, as I feel like I've aged in

[04:36] entrepreneurial doggy years, the more I strive for this than anything else. Because if you conquer

[04:43] this piece, you conquer the customer surplus in terms of how much value they are getting for what

[04:48] they are paying. Then you will have an infinitely scalable business because you will have a quadratic

[04:54] way of expanding, which is through worth now, which is the antithesis of what everyone in the market

[04:58] will tell you. But the goal should always be to have a business that grows a word of mouth.

[05:02] The problem is most people don't have enough word of mouth because this surplus is not big enough.

[05:08] If you have the surplus big enough and you go from good to great and great to so good that people

[05:12] cannot help but tell their friends about you, remark a goal or remark worthy. That is how good it is.

[05:19] Then you will have more customers that you know what to do with in your cost of acquisition will be zero.

[05:23] And your business will grow quadratically, not linearly. That is the difference between

[05:29] making money and building a fortune. I thought of this visual with the three lines and I just thought

[05:34] it was really telling and so I thought I would keep this short in the spirit of Rhona to show you this.

[05:39] But if you can think through how you are providing value and really focus because the things

[05:44] that you can control, you can control all three of these variables. But when I am trying to diagnose a

[05:48] problem that I want to solve as an entrepreneur, I think how can I provide the most value

[05:52] step one. Step two, how can I lower my cost of goods sold to a crazy degree?

[05:58] And then once I know how I can lower my cost of goods sold to a crazy degree, I'd rather have

[06:03] some in the cost me a penny that I can sell for 10 cents that has the value of $10. And if you have

[06:10] that kind of value that you are able to deliver, you will make a literal F-turn of money. And so I think

[06:18] this is a useful framework. You can apply your own business, you can probably apply your

[06:22] competitor's business using this simple framework. And I thought I would give it to you because it's

[06:25] one of the tools that I use when I'm thinking through how valuable an enterprise could potentially be.

[06:29] And how I can move these lines around to create value, create margin and ultimately take home

[06:36] the most money and out the most people. Just like everything that we do, hopefully the price that you

[06:42] paid was the time, the value that you got was hopefully a framework that you can use to apply to your

[06:47] business. And the cost to get sold for me is the time that it takes me to do this and the many failures and

[06:52] lessons I've learned and suffer the hard cost of failure to make these little frameworks for you.

[06:58] So anyways, most of the nation, I love you guys, the reason I make this stuff is because a lot of

[07:02] people are broken, I don't want you to be one of them. Keep being awesome if you enjoyed this

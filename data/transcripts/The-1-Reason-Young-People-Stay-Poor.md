[00:00] 20 year old stay poor because they start trying to earn

[00:03] rather than trying to learn.

[00:05] They did a survey of high school seniors,

[00:07] 52% believe that they will be a millionaire by 25.

[00:11] It's delusion.

[00:12] You can try and roll the dice and have a 1 in a thousand shot

[00:16] of being a millionaire in 90 days.

[00:18] Or I can guarantee that you'll be a millionaire in a decade.

[00:21] Which would you prefer?

[00:23] So I want to give you a quick example of two guys

[00:25] about the same age that took two very different directions in life.

[00:29] One of them went to another guy who is a little bit older

[00:31] tried to learn the basics of editing video.

[00:34] Use the buddy to get a job interview and he'd learn enough

[00:37] that he could get a job off of.

[00:38] This particular company had a huge suite of other people who

[00:41] have significantly more advanced.

[00:42] Creative director who's done multiple big brands

[00:45] that he had the ability to learn from.

[00:47] He gets a $60,000 off of.

[00:49] Which is solid amount of money for editing.

[00:51] With basically no experience who then,

[00:54] rather than accept the job, he asked for $3,000 more.

[00:57] Because what he thought he had to do was earn

[01:00] rather than learn.

[01:01] The business is obviously not going to do that.

[01:04] With this guy does, as he started trying to negotiate back and forth,

[01:06] wheels and deals, and then eventually gets a job to be the lead head

[01:10] honshow of video editing and at some small business that has no

[01:14] other mentors.

[01:15] There's no other people ahead of him.

[01:16] He took the right hook in his career 12 weeks after getting into it.

[01:21] And now they're the ones who are trying to extract as much from him.

[01:23] Rather than coming into a business where he's the small man on the

[01:26] totem pole, and he can learn from everyone else,

[01:28] which would maximize for his long-term network.

[01:31] When you're early on, you learn this much and you think you know everything.

[01:34] And it's something called the Dunning Kruger effect.

[01:36] The more you learn in a specific skill, the more you realize you don't know.

[01:40] Other guy, same idea, wanted to make money, but had zero skills.

[01:45] Because he's 17 years old. Of course you would have in his skills.

[01:48] He decided, because he talked to a mentor who's older than him.

[01:51] And today I think you'd have a facility for sales.

[01:53] I think you'd be good at.

[01:54] He said whatever the minimum quota is that they tell you to do an activity.

[01:57] Double it. This was a sales role.

[01:59] And so he was required to do a hundred calls a day.

[02:01] He did 200 calls a day. Why?

[02:02] Because he's not a skill.

[02:03] So he has to do twice the work in order to get the same output as somebody who's more experienced.

[02:07] The mentor also said, go and spend as much time as you possibly can with the number one guy.

[02:10] Listen to everything he does and watch what he does.

[02:13] So that's what he did.

[02:13] And then he proved himself as number one on that bottom team.

[02:16] Then he got promoted.

[02:17] He's a youngest guy there.

[02:18] Worked as well.

[02:19] But he realized was that no one was going to get from respect as one his age.

[02:23] He stacked his way up, stacked his way up.

[02:25] Then became one of the top closers in the company where many people were experts at sales.

[02:29] And he was able to learn from them.

[02:30] He was hungry and he did extra hours.

[02:32] Now at this point in his career, he could right now probably start a million dollar business.

[02:37] Or he could reinvest.

[02:39] And so he got another opportunity to work at a much more prestigious company.

[02:43] Or he'll get even bigger and better experience.

[02:45] And guess what?

[02:46] He's going to get paid less than he was making his current job.

[02:48] Why would he do it?

[02:49] Because he's smart, not thinking short.

[02:51] If you go for the earning early, you stop the learning.

[02:54] And the moment you stop the learning is when you decide and you tell the universe that I have made

[02:59] enough, this is enough for me.

[03:01] Start at the bottom and learn every skill along the way.

[03:05] Kobe Bryant was famous for doing this where he would do two practices a day.

[03:09] My name is Kobe Bryant.

[03:11] 17 years old.

[03:12] Files and Saturdays.

[03:13] I would go in my record room with my basketball and basically dribble myself to sleep.

[03:17] I think that that was the best thing that could ever happen to.

[03:20] Because doing those lonely hours in the bedroom, I discovered the hunger, the motivation,

[03:24] and the desire to be the best possible basketball player that I could be.

[03:28] And he thought if everybody else does one practice today, if I do two a day,

[03:32] I will get better faster.

[03:33] And in the beginning, the difference is not that noticeable.

[03:36] But after five years and then ten years, he becomes unbeatable.

[03:39] Whether you're trying to get into law or you're trying to get into accounting.

[03:42] Or you're trying to get into sales.

[03:44] Or you're trying to get into marketing.

[03:45] Whatever the poor activity that you do, making videos, making ads, writing sales pages.

[03:50] Actually doing sales calls.

[03:51] Whatever it is, if you do two times for four times the volume, you will get better, faster,

[03:56] and pay down your ignorance debt and a faster rate that compounds.

[03:59] He has compounded the number of hours in the trenches learning the thing.

[04:03] Respect is always earned and the younger you are, the more you have to earn it.

[04:06] And you can either resent the world for not giving you respect with that you do not deserve.

[04:10] Or you can go get it.

[04:11] Hustle across age, gender, culture is always respected.

[04:16] It's one of the universal currencies respect.

[04:18] But the problem is that people want the respect before they do the house.

[04:21] What? The killers look like in their 20s who become the killers in their 30s.

[04:26] Don't look like the kid with the lambal in the watch.

[04:29] What they look like is hungry as fuck to learn and work.

[04:33] If you can humble yourself and you realize the done and cruelly effect exists,

[04:36] that you think you know more than you do when you start because you don't know anything.

[04:39] That's why soccer you said, the more I know, the more I realize I know nothing.

[04:43] One of the smartest wise people in the world is you knew nothing.

[04:46] I'm going to flip to my employer hat for a second.

[04:48] If someone comes in, if they're in the earnings season, I will work you because I know that this is the only

[04:54] exchange. If you come in and I know you're in a learning season, then we will be so generous with

[04:59] how much we can give and reinvest in you. The exchange when you're coming in and I have to pay

[05:03] you above to get you to come here means that I have to extract more value from you than I pay you.

[05:07] That's the fundamental of business. But if you come in with a learning hat on,

[05:11] the nap is the sooner understands that maybe in five years not going to be there.

[05:14] They can be like, cool, how can I assist you in your career? What skill sets do you feel like you

[05:18] lack? I can pair you with people in the company who are further ahead in the year and help you

[05:22] get mentorship within our company and you learn for free. Not only that, I'm going to pay you to

[05:26] work. So the most important thing you have to realize when you're in your 20s is what season you are in.

[05:31] You have to stop comparing yourself to people who are earning more than you because it means that

[05:35] what they're doing is often short-changing their long-term earning for short-term earning.

[05:39] There is a time for the earning. But the moment that you decide to make that right hook,

[05:43] it's going to be hard to come back because you're going to earn more. And you decide

[05:47] that from here and out, you can't really learn much from people. How do you because they're not

[05:51] going to give to you the same way you would if you were in their business? Your ability to provide

[05:56] value will compound with time, especially as you start pairing skills. If you think about the

[06:02] Jay-Z in the beginning of his career, the first thing you did was he learned how to wrap.

[06:06] Jay-Z is the bad thing. You're not a master. You're going to rhyme at the big of the bad Jay-Z

[06:10] but you just say, yeah, the pro-failant. And then he started learning how to promote

[06:14] another skill, significantly more money. And then after that, if you're going to have to do a record

[06:18] label and distribute, even more money. And then after that, he figured out how to recruit other artists

[06:22] and get them sound on his label even more money. And so what happens is that he still needs

[06:27] these early skill sets. Even though he didn't monetize some part there, he monetized them big

[06:32] later. Skills will compound. If you have one plus one, pull someone, it doesn't equal three

[06:36] when it comes to skills. If you are good at math, cool. If you learn bookkeeping, a little bit

[06:41] more. If you learn how to become an accountant, even more. If you start understanding taxes and

[06:45] insurance, all of a sudden you're a CFO. Now, if you start understanding M&A and mergers, entity structures,

[06:51] all of a sudden, you're not only a CFO, you're a rainmaker. You're somebody who can bring in deals,

[06:55] execute deals, etc. The earning potential difference between somebody who's an account and a rainmaker

[07:00] is tens of millions of dollars per year. So one of my heroes, Warren Buffett, he finished

[07:04] top of his class at Columbia Business School. Somebody finished his top of the class at Columbia.

[07:08] It can get a job paying very well in most places. But guess what he did, he asked Ben Graham to let

[07:15] him work at his investment firm for free. Ben Graham was one of the goats of investing at the time

[07:20] when Warren Buffett was just a kid coming out of college. Chance to study on her. It shaped my professional

[07:27] life. And guess what Ben Graham said to him when he asked him to work for him? He said you're overpriced.

[07:32] Ben Graham knew, just as Warren Buffett knew, that even though he was working for free,

[07:36] it was going to cost Ben Graham more to deliver all of the skills and all of the things that he

[07:41] would need to be successful than the monetary compensation. But because Warren Buffett is smart,

[07:46] he realized that he was in a season of learning and not earning it. He was willing to invest

[07:51] as one of the greatest investors of all time in the thing that was most important and valuable to him

[07:54] at the time himself. And he did it for free. I'm going to flip this real quick and tell you a little

[08:00] bit on my own story. People are this. I finished Mag and Cumali in three years at Bennerville. I could earn

[08:05] decent amount of money at most places graduating like that. I then took a consulting job that was

[08:10] paid less than most of my other people were, but because I could work directly with the CEO. So I was

[08:15] going to learn more. I then gave up on the consulting career to do fitness. The first move I made

[08:21] was I asked 40 different homeowners if I could work for them for free. Mind you, I was a Mag and Cumali,

[08:26] graduate, vice president of the power of the team, I was president of the fraternity,

[08:29] came from consulting background like I had a lot of skills. But I realized that I was going to be

[08:34] getting more out of the exchange than the person who I was working for and so I asked for a free.

[08:39] He started to employ me and he eventually started paying me minimum wage. I would have to swallow

[08:44] my pride in order to take that job, but it was one of the best investments I ever made and rather

[08:49] than compare myself to the people who were earning more than me and I'm going to be real with you.

[08:52] I did it and it hurt. But if you learn from one of the best in the industry if anything,

[08:57] you should be paying them and the fact that they will accept you at any price is worth it every time.

[09:02] It would be like me going to Elon Musk and saying, I'll be your assistant. He offers me

[09:06] $100,000 a year. I like, I would like to offer you $100,000 per year to be my assistant.

[09:12] And maybe like I'll come for $200. Actually you're stupid, never mind. Think about how stupid

[09:17] that is. That's the decision 20 year olds make every day or hoping that most of the nation you

[09:22] aren't like that, you're willing to make the long-term trade because when you have this track record,

[09:26] this stack of undeniable proof that you are who you say you are, you have done what you say you've done.

[09:30] You don't need to pretend, you don't need to front because you have the experience. And then people

[09:36] will respect you because of what you have done, not what you say.

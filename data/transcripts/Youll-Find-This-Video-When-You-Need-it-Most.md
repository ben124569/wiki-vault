[00:00] The single greatest skill you can develop is the ability to stay in a great mood in the absence of things to be in a great mood about.

[00:05] I've had some of the hardest days of my life this year, maybe you feel the same way.

[00:09] And so in this video, I want to share a four-part framework that has helped me move forward even when life feels hard.

[00:14] So number one, learn the greatest skill.

[00:17] If you can be in a bad mood for no reason, then you might as well be in a good mood for no reason too.

[00:22] One of the things that's been helpful for me is just actually recognizing the math of hard days.

[00:26] Think about you having a hundred days, right?

[00:28] Let's just say that you've, you know, last hundred days of your life.

[00:31] Well, the top 10 percent of those days, you're going to have ten days that are a smiley face days.

[00:36] And then you might have, you know, kind of the middle 80, that's going to be kind of neutral days, right?

[00:41] And then you're going to have your bottom 10 percent days.

[00:43] Now, this is just normal because of a standard distribution of how days work.

[00:48] When I think back on, you know, my days sometimes I'm like, you know what?

[00:51] Maybe today is just a bottom 10 percent day.

[00:53] And if I didn't have this bottom 10 percent day, then I wouldn't be able to recognize the difference between these days and the top 10 percent days.

[00:59] And so in order for me to want to have top 10 percent days,

[01:01] I by definition must also have bottom 10 percent days.

[01:04] I think the most important skill that you could have is being able to reframe reality.

[01:10] And I say this because I had a very good friend of mine this year, say something to me.

[01:15] And it was, it was really powerful and it's been top of mine since he said it.

[01:18] He said, you're Alex from her mozi.

[01:20] You can get away with whatever you want as long as you frame it right.

[01:23] And I really thought a lot about that.

[01:26] And I brought that perspective to a lot of the conversations, a lot of the difficult things that I've

[01:31] had to go through this year. It reminds me of a quote from Victor Franco, who wrote the book

[01:34] a man search for meaning, which he wrote while he was in the concentration cancer in the

[01:37] Holocaust and he survived or he wrote about that time period.

[01:40] And one of the things that he said is he who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.

[01:46] If you think about that, the why is the reframe for dealing with the how.

[01:50] How can I frame this this difficult thing?

[01:53] This thing that I'm about to go through, that I just went through. How can I reframe that?

[01:56] And what world would this be an amazing thing?

[01:58] And what world where when I tell this story 40, 50 years from now, what I be like,

[02:02] this is a pivot point for me. I had to have this origin story in order to get

[02:05] to I wanted to go to become the type of person I wanted to be.

[02:08] These have been some of the mental reframes that I've used on some of the harder days that I've had.

[02:11] So this year I had a gigantic bill come out of nowhere. So there's a multi-eight figure bill

[02:17] that was required to get paid in 72 hours in cash. I you know, thankfully had that available to me.

[02:25] But I had obviously different plans for that money. They're dealing with this gigantic bill

[02:31] that I had to all of a sudden pay within 72 hours. Basically the moment between when I got the

[02:35] news to me paying it to then kind of reflecting back, because it almost felt so fast or as like,

[02:40] I've got, you know, I've got all these plans and then boom, this happens and then 72 hours later,

[02:44] it's like, wow, okay, what am I going to do? What am I going to do kind of moving forward from this?

[02:49] And there's this great quote by Marcus Aurelius, which is,

[02:52] what are you so afraid of losing when nothing in this world belongs to you?

[02:56] I really thought a lot about that, which it's like, I can't take it with me in the end.

[03:01] And so being sad about losing something that was never really mind anyways,

[03:05] like, I'm going to have to push all my chips to the middle of the board when the game's over.

[03:09] I'm going to have to cash my chips and somebody else, you know, other people are going to

[03:11] distribute my chips when I die. And so it's like, I'm really just a steward of these chips. I'm just

[03:15] renting these chips for a minute to be upset and to ruin the one thing that I'm only that is that is

[03:19] finite, which is the present moment for something that actually doesn't affect high lives. So this is

[03:23] the second piece. So it's actually a kind of a utilitarian perspective, it really helped me. By losing that

[03:26] money, I asked myself, what does this change about what I do? What's this change about my life?

[03:33] It doesn't change the food I eat, it doesn't change where I live, it doesn't change where I work,

[03:36] it doesn't change what I do, it actually changes nothing. All that change was just like,

[03:41] in my mind, I had an expectation of the future that changed. That was it. And I said, okay, because

[03:48] of this thing that existed my mind, I am choosing to punish myself for not having seen this

[03:53] or not paying attention or whatever number of reasons I could blame myself for. But at the end of

[03:58] the day, I was like, okay, so you just get to pick how long you want to beat yourself up for.

[04:00] It was like, huh, well, what am I so afraid of losing? If nothing in this world belongs to me,

[04:05] nothing this wasn't mine to be good with. It's not really kind of helped me

[04:09] quail that kind of negative thought pattern pretty quickly. So there's to put a little comedic

[04:13] spin on this, Mark Twain, which has some of the best quotes like ever, by the way. You said,

[04:16] I've lived through many terrible tragedies, only some of them actually happened.

[04:21] It's like, you know, most of us suffer almost exclusively in our minds. I found it helpful

[04:26] when I'm in a bad season. Like I am right now, to be fair, I don't try to like put big

[04:30] labels on things, but I guess I'm just giving myself a little bit of grace. But to just folks don't

[04:35] having a good day. And so it's like, okay, even though this is a bad season, I'm going to have a

[04:39] good day in a bad season. It's kind of like a bite-sized victory. And if I start stringing enough

[04:44] of those good days in a row, I'm going to turn a bad season back into a good season. And it makes

[04:49] it feel a little less bad, because I feel like I'm making progress. I heard this bit by Bill

[04:53] Aquaman who is like getting sued, he was going through divorce, he just lost four billion dollars

[04:57] in pairishing square for his capital. So he was like, honestly, all of this happened the same time.

[05:01] And he realized all these projects for these big massive things, which is a lot of kind of the

[05:05] stuff I'm doing with my other, not like, okay, I had a bad day. They're like things that just

[05:08] left, they last and they prolong, right? He said, you just got a little bit done every day.

[05:13] That's it. He's like, you just got to make a little bit of progress every day. And kind of like

[05:16] compounding and investing, it's like, you don't really, you don't see it in a day or two or

[05:20] week or two. It's like, but you look at back at 30 days. You're like, all right, I'm moving the ball

[05:23] a little bit. You look back at nine. You're like, all right, I made some progress. And it's just like,

[05:28] if you have big goals, you're also going to have equally large obstacles. And so you can't assume that,

[05:34] oh, my big goals are going to take many, many years. And then the obstacles that I have to maneuver

[05:38] around are going to happen overnight. Sometimes obstacles that you have to maneuver around might take

[05:42] a year or multiple years to get around. It's to be able to manage your headspace and basically

[05:46] keep your internal combustion engine going during those harder times. And so it's kind of like

[05:50] a monkey swinging from good moment to good moment. Because even going from bad season to good day,

[05:56] you can even have bad day and good moment. So I'll try to thought, okay, today was a good day.

[06:01] Fine. What good moments that I have. And by focusing on the moments when I look back on my life,

[06:07] you forget most of your life, like if we're being real, like you can't recall most of your life.

[06:11] Most people can't even recall what they ate like three days ago. But you can't have the moments

[06:16] and to the moments when I think about at the end of my life looking backwards, those are the

[06:19] only things I'm really going to remember. I just want to make sure that I take those down.

[06:23] Feels like a bad season now. I can try and forget most of the bad stuff. I just try and remember

[06:28] the good moments. In retrospect, I can have rose colored glasses when it comes to this season.

[06:33] How do you have a good day? And I think this is different for everyone. But I'll tell you what my

[06:37] little formula is for having a good day. Good day formula. For me, there's only three things.

[06:44] Number one is eat with people I like. Simple enough. Number two, lift with people I like.

[06:54] And the third is write something. If I do those three things, I had a pretty good day. Like I look

[07:01] back and I'm like, I earn my shower today. I feel good about this. Maybe for you, your three things

[07:06] are going to be entirely different. Now, I'll give you a little wrinkle on something that's been

[07:09] really valuable for me. Like absurdly valuable. The thing that I noticed that made these two things

[07:14] to give you any better. Really all three of these things is not being in a rush. If I have to lift

[07:20] and it's like, I only have 60 minutes to lift, I don't like that. Some people are fine with it.

[07:24] Some people are like, well, this is how my life has to be. That's fine. I have come to a point

[07:28] in my life where I was like, I have a lot of money. And I have the ability to not work anymore.

[07:35] And there are not a huge amount of things that bring me big joy. If these are the few things that

[07:40] bring me joy, which is eating without a clock, with people I like, lifting without a clock,

[07:46] with people I like, and writing something for as long as I feel like, then I should organize my

[07:52] day so that I don't have as like many, many heart stops so that if I want to lift in the morning,

[07:57] I don't have something at nine. And if I do have something at nine, it's something that's movable.

[08:01] Right, like if I have to make this video, it can be at nine, but the team knows if I

[08:05] show up at 930 or 945 because I've lifted longer, that's fine. It's all good. It has taken my good

[08:10] day formula and made it like my super good day formula. And so sometimes it's like, what are the

[08:16] tiny nuances that actually makes something different between good and great? I thought about

[08:20] like the days that I had these three things happened and then I had better days that had those

[08:23] three things happened. And I was like, what was the difference in the difference was that I didn't

[08:26] have to be some r else? And in trying not to have a rush, it means I have to give something

[08:33] else up. Then the question is, is the thing that I've been giving up worth having a better day?

[08:37] For me, I was like, yes, I'm willing to give up some money or some upside in order to have

[08:42] consistently better days. And that's a trade on willing to make at this point in my career.

[08:47] So let's move on to number two, which is redefine pain. If you want to achieve a goal,

[08:53] you're either going to have to accept a boredom or pain. And the bigger the goal, the more of

[08:58] both you'll get. When I started my gym, I actually lived with six other people in one house.

[09:04] This is like off a beach town. Think like sand everywhere, people everywhere, dirty dishes everywhere,

[09:09] not an efferum and refrigerator for food, cooking was an absolute mess, almost all of them had dogs.

[09:16] So a couple had two dogs, another couple had one dog, another guy had a dog, four different dogs

[09:20] in the house. And they were like all marking territory, it was horrendous. And I was splitting one room

[09:27] with a guy, with a bed, like two beds, my bed was on the floor, his bed was elevated, because he

[09:33] he could afford that at the time. And I would sleep with a fan on my face, I couldn't hear anything.

[09:37] That was my secret, like as the bed, like there's like the window over like it's all I could hear.

[09:41] The thing is, is like, I was doing that when I was making like 20 grand a month take home.

[09:45] There's always trade-offs. And the trade-off for me of living in that condition was that I could

[09:50] invest in the dream and build the business that I had at the time. Now I could look back,

[09:54] I ended up losing everything, you know, a few years later, you know, you get this negative cycle of like

[09:58] all of that suffering was for nothing. But it wasn't for nothing, because I learned all these skills along the way.

[10:03] You also can't operate from the perspective of like, I might lose it all in the future,

[10:07] which means everything they do today is not worth anything. Because like you're going to lose 100%

[10:11] of everything the moment you die. So trying to say that you might lose something in the future is

[10:15] a reason not to do something as ridiculous. You're going to lose everything at some point.

[10:19] You cannot wish for both strong character and an easy life because the price of one is the other.

[10:24] When I think about pain, I think about what thing am I paying for right now.

[10:28] And is that thing something that I want? And if so, it reframes the pain as the price of the thing that I want.

[10:37] This is super interesting. It's they've done research on this where they have somebody who

[10:40] like accepts like shocks. They can like opt out at any point. If you have the same man

[10:45] who's getting shocked and then you tell that man in the other room, every shock he takes,

[10:51] his family doesn't have to take. His threshold of pain like quadruples. This may seem like some,

[10:58] quote, mindset, whatever. But the thing is is like the bigger your goals, the more pain you're going

[11:04] to endure, whether you want to or not, it's the price. And if you can endure four times more pain

[11:08] than someone else, I don't actually think that it feels four times more painful. I think it

[11:13] feels the same level of pain, but you have this padding that makes it feel worth it.

[11:18] Give them in a purpose and the ability to achieve it and he will crawl over broken glass with a smile.

[11:23] That broken glass, like how can you have a smile during the pain? It's because of what the pain

[11:29] itself represents. Now I'm going to get it a little bit into behavior because I think it's it's

[11:32] valuable. I talk a lot about reward and punishment. But those are kind of more colloquial terms.

[11:37] When it comes down to behavior, it's actually reinforcers. A reinforcer can be negative,

[11:42] meaning it can be something that's aversive. So for example, if I know that every time I hit my

[11:49] hand with a hammer, I'm going to grow muscle, hitting my hand with a hammer or taking the shock

[11:53] for my family, means something positive, which is that I'm protecting my family, I'm helping my

[11:58] country. I'm doing something that I deem meaningful. The pain itself can become a positive reinforcer

[12:04] because you know you're making progress towards the thing you want. Now you might think of that

[12:08] and be like, well, I don't want to have the pain. The thing is is that when you're going through it

[12:11] if you have this frame, it isn't as painful. In a lot of ways, it's like we are our own sculpture

[12:16] that we're working on and as we chisel away, we also get to reveal the type of person that we want

[12:22] to become, the traits and the behaviors and the beliefs that go with the manner woman that we're trying

[12:27] to grow into. And so I wrote this story, how to say year ago, maybe two years ago, that

[12:31] related this that I just want to share with you. So imagine you're talking to the creative

[12:35] universe about the person that you want to become. And so you say, you know, I want to be courageous.

[12:40] And the creator replies, then I will give you monsters that terrify you. That way you can conquer them.

[12:46] And you say, well, I want to be patient. And the creator replies, then I want to make you

[12:49] work harder and longer and nothing will come easy to you. That way you can learn to wait.

[12:54] Or like, okay, well, I want to be wise. And something creator says, then I will give you failures

[12:58] that were crushed your spirit. That way you can learn the value of judgment. And you say,

[13:02] that sounds like a hard life. Can you give me a good life? And the creator replies,

[13:06] just like we mentioned the quality of a blacksmith by the strength of his steel.

[13:10] I measure you by what you are at the end, not the fire and the hammer that it took to make you.

[13:14] A good life isn't an easy life. A good life makes you into a good person. And that my child is a hard

[13:20] life. It's about who we become doing the work more than the outcome from the work itself. And I love

[13:25] this. And this is a reframing of proverbs. But the work works on you more than you work on you.

[13:29] Like in all labor there is profit. Meaning we always benefit from work. Even if the thing that we work on

[13:36] gets destroyed, even if you went bankrupt, even if that relationship didn't work out, even if

[13:41] that partnership falls apart, the work you did is eternal because it changes you. For those

[13:46] you don't know who are new to my channel. I lost everything five years in my entrepreneurial journey.

[13:51] And then I made a little bit more and then I lost it all again. But the thing is that I had this idea

[13:57] that, oh, I have to start from scratch again. But that's not true because you can only start from

[14:02] scratch once. Every time after that you start with an experience. A man with an experience is

[14:08] never at the mercy of a man with an opinion. And you transition from the second to the first.

[14:14] The moment you begin working because you're no longer somebody who has an opinion. And as

[14:19] soon as you know what that truth is, because you've been there and you've actually done it and you

[14:24] have the scars to show for it, then their opinions matter significantly less. I'll give you a different

[14:31] reframe that I've had for redefining pain as it relates to other people, which is you can summarize

[14:38] just about every hateful comment on the internet into one thing. He lives his life in a way that I would

[14:43] not prefer. That's it. Everything is. He lives his life in a way that I would not prefer.

[14:50] To which I respond? Yes. I do live my life in a way that most people would not prefer. And they live

[14:55] their life in a way that I would not prefer. And that is why it is their life. And they can live

[14:59] their life the way that they want to live their life. The way they prefer it. And I will live my life

[15:03] the way that I prefer it. They cast these stones at you as though it matters. My dad told me this

[15:08] when he was going through his divorce. He said he went through this like divorce conference and

[15:12] the speaker on stage said to somebody in the audience he said, hey, here's a ball and he threw it to him.

[15:16] I said, okay, throw it back to me. So he caught the ball. He said, now I want you to imagine that

[15:20] this ball is a steaming hot pile of the... and he threw it to the person again and the person caught it.

[15:27] He said, why would you catch it? And so the lesson of that is just because someone

[15:31] hurl, yeah, you doesn't mean you need to catch it. You don't need to choose to participate.

[15:36] And I thought that was a really interesting frame. People can hurt whatever they want.

[15:40] It doesn't mean that they have justified a response or that you need to accept it. And that little

[15:44] reframe of, oh, I live my life in a way that other people would not prefer. Well, that makes sense.

[15:48] I'm not trying to live the same life as them. So of course. And then they say he made trade-offs

[15:53] that I would not make. And I said, of course, of course I did. Why is this, why is this somehow

[15:58] an insult? When I was making the trades in the earlier days, I didn't know when I would be successful.

[16:03] Or if I would be successful. The only thing that I knew for sure was that I wasn't going to stop.

[16:10] And that was it. I know I can just not stop. And that's something that I can commit to.

[16:14] And that's controllable. I think a lot of the big gifts of hardship is that it doesn't

[16:19] define you. It reveals you. The benefit is that you get to see who you really are. And you make that decision

[16:24] yourself every day. I have this perspective on loyalty, which is that like you cannot say that you

[16:29] are loyal until your loyalty is tested. You cannot say your patient until your patient is tested.

[16:34] Otherwise, it's an opinion, not an experience. You can't say that you handle hardship

[16:39] and that you were emotionally resilient until you've had something to be emotionally resilient about.

[16:44] The gift of the hard time is to give you proof of who you are so that the rest of your life,

[16:48] you get to know that you did that. And you get to tell that story and relive that story to yourself

[16:54] for the rest of your life. And to me, that gives the hardship, memory dividends that pay forever

[17:00] until the day you die. I'll tell you stories. I went to a school in the SEC and some of the SEC

[17:05] schools are renowned for hazing and aggressive stuff. And so I was going to join a fraternity.

[17:11] And obviously they build up how hard pledging is going to be. And I called my dad to talk about it.

[17:19] And he just said, remember there is nothing that they can do to you that is harder than what you've

[17:24] already been through. And it was a great reframe because I remember the times, you know, like when

[17:30] things would be called hard during that season of pledging. And I would just think about the things

[17:35] that I had already survived. The things that I had already been through at that point. And it made

[17:40] what they believed to be suffering a pure child. And I was like, this is cute. But for the

[17:45] people who are present in the moment, rather than being able to relive through their memory dividends,

[17:50] using it as a shield for my emotional affect during the moment. It was like, all right, I have

[17:55] these eight weeks where I have to stay at here before you apparently give me a stay up for approval.

[17:59] Fine. Then I will do that. I live my life in ways that you would not prefer. And that carried me a

[18:05] pretty long way. And so let's say that you've used these tools to redefine pain. Right? And

[18:10] you've realized that you are the outcome. The work you do is the only thing you control and the

[18:14] person you become becomes the evidence of the work that you voluntarily subjected yourself to.

[18:21] And not only does that pain where that difficult to you're discomfort make you better,

[18:27] it's also what separates you from everyone else. And whenever I do go through those moments,

[18:32] I do have these slight like, Kirk of the smile. You know, the Kirk of my life that goes up

[18:36] because I'm reminded that everything that I'm willing to tolerate and deal with is what everyone else

[18:42] who wants to do the same thing will be incapable of doing. If it's hard for me, it will be just as

[18:48] hard for somebody else. And I think for some reason that gives me some sadistic pleasure that I will be able

[18:55] to keep moving forward. That's kind of a perfect transition to number three, right, which is

[19:00] enduring what others hold. All of this becomes your competitive advantage. And that competitive

[19:06] advantage compounds. The more memories you have of hardship that you've been through, the more it

[19:10] stacks, the more it becomes a trait, the more it becomes in ingrained in your behavior. And the more

[19:16] it takes to shake you because you're like, well, this is my baseline. This isn't even close.

[19:20] It's not even, it doesn't even register on my scale of something that's in inconvenience.

[19:23] We've all met that person where like if a, if a call gets moved or a, you know, dinner plate is

[19:28] late. It's like, it's like a nuclear bomb went off. Right. It's like, well, what's the opposite of that?

[19:32] Like, what's the person who like, it doesn't matter if a nuclear bomb went off, but all you see is a

[19:36] straight line completely undisturbed by the things that are going around them. Because you can beat

[19:41] 99% of people without being smarter or luckier, but by being willing to under pain and uncertainty

[19:47] for longer. It's hard for you. It's hard for everyone else. And most people avoid hard things,

[19:53] which is why you can beat most people by just trying and continuing to try. And the main thing is

[19:59] is that I think most people don't even know what trying feels like. Layla and I have been going through

[20:05] this season, so it hasn't just been me. And she had a mentor say something to her that she told me and I

[20:10] really liked it. She said, hey, you know, we had this difficult situation and, you know, we're kind of

[20:15] relegated to, you know, this option or this option and neither of the options were particularly good.

[20:20] And she said to Layla, are you settling or are you moving mountains? And I really like that

[20:29] because like whenever I'm looking at these choices that I feel like sometimes feel bad, I'm like,

[20:34] is there another option that I could see if I move the f***ing mountain? And that has just dramatically

[20:41] increased the willingness to work, to really try. I keep thinking to myself like, okay, well,

[20:49] if I was going to get killed or Layla was going to get killed or people I cared about

[20:52] we're going to die if I didn't come up with another solution or if I made the thing that I wanted

[20:56] to have happened happen, what other things would I do? And usually it's a lot more. Whatever way you

[21:02] have to unlock that level of trying, that level of effort, like most things are hilariously

[21:07] easy to do, which is just more easy, it's easier to just do nothing. Most people do nothing and get

[21:13] nothing and are dissatisfied because their expectations said they would get something for that

[21:17] nothing of work. What's crazy is that the highest levels of effort are so rare amongst people

[21:24] that you can unlock most things in the universe with it by just really trying like your life depends

[21:30] on it because it does. Most of the time we know what we're supposed to do, we just have trouble doing

[21:36] it. Like you know what you need to do to get a six pack. You know what you need to do to build

[21:41] muscle. People already know this. You don't need to know anything about training to do that. You're

[21:47] just stop eating crap, maybe eat some protein and add more weight to the bar over to

[21:50] extended period of time. That's it. That's all it is. You know that already and yet you haven't

[21:56] begun because you haven't really tried. Like it's hilarious to me. It's it's apparently rareer

[22:02] to have a six pack above age like 30, then it is to be a millionaire. Like think about crazy

[22:07] it is and don't cite the sources. I heard that and I believe it. What if a 9% of Americans

[22:13] a net worth of a million dollars surprising right? 9% of Americans certainly don't have a six pack.

[22:18] It's rareer to have a six pack and be a millionaire. I just I think about that. It's like we know

[22:24] what to do. It's just we're not willing to endure what it's required to get it and we're not willing

[22:29] to reframe that pain as the price of the thing we want and to give our pain meaning. Fortunately

[22:34] you're unfortunately you know humans we live in a competitive environment. We seek status because of

[22:39] evolutionary backdrops. And so how do you beat other people and I want to be clear? I don't

[22:45] really think you need to beat anybody. If you just beat you every day you'll beat everybody to

[22:49] bite a fall and I think that you'll get to the end of the race and realize no one else is

[22:52] really racing anyways. But the main main is that you need to get out of I had to actually

[22:58] conversation with somebody on my team this morning. They're saying they wanted to do this training

[23:02] for the Department of the They're in and they wanted to talk about running on clean energy versus

[23:06] dark energy. And I was like what does that mean? He's like you know clean energy is like you're going

[23:09] towards something dark energy you're just like you're running away from something. And I thought I

[23:13] think there's a really good and no-ble idea. The problem is no one's going to know what to do with

[23:18] that because what it really meant was if you guys do your jobs using quote clean energy or knowing

[23:24] when to use quote dark energy you will be more effective. Okay fine now we have conditions for

[23:30] behavior. I asked him I said if you want this training to be significant more effective then you do

[23:34] two things. Number one is to find what having clean energy looks like how do I observe someone who

[23:38] has clean energy? What do they do? They talk differently? They ask different questions. They have

[23:42] different cadence. And to the same degree you're having dark energy so you ask more times. You push

[23:46] back more often. Let's define this in terms of behavior. And then we'll probably find is that there's

[23:50] no such thing as cleaner dark energy. There's only behaviors that under certain conditions increase

[23:54] the likelihood of a positive outcome or a desired outcome. Okay. In these conditions do this and

[24:00] in other conditions do that. And so that we can get away from these amorphous terms and the reason I'm

[24:04] bringing this up is that we have to define everything in terms of actions that you're going to take.

[24:08] Let me give you a visual of the difference between sadness and anxiety. I'm going to draw them

[24:14] and you tell me which one is anxiety and which one is sadness.

[24:18] Which one is anxiety? Which one is sadness?

[24:31] Anxiety? sadness. sadness comes from a perceived lack of options which is why it feels like hopelessness.

[24:39] Anxiety comes from many options but he lack of priorities which is why it feels like paralysis.

[24:45] So looking everywhere but moving nowhere. And so you solve sadness with knowledge and anxiety

[24:53] with the decision. The goal from here is to see the path that's available to you and you have to

[24:59] do that by learning. Once you have a path, if you have too many paths then you have to start

[25:05] cutting paths off so you can say this is where I'm going and then I have no more anxiety around this.

[25:11] So if you don't know what to do the answer is to learn. If you know what to do the answers to do it

[25:17] and if you're already doing it the answer is to never stop. What I will reinforce here

[25:22] is that none of those three actions that I just defined have anything to do about how you feel

[25:28] today or in this moment. I want to be very clear people think that I'm this unemotional or

[25:33] zero-affect person. It's not true at all. Of course I feel things. The difference is

[25:38] so what? Like I can feel terrible and still do the acts that increase the likelihood of success.

[25:47] It's not trying to negate the fact that you have emotions or that you have bad feelings.

[25:52] It's about continuing on the path one step in front of the other despite that. And I think that

[25:58] the more you learn that your actions do not need to be equated to how you feel. The more these

[26:05] feelings can just be in the backdrop and ultimately they make you resilient. So let me show you

[26:09] what resilience looks like. Which ones resilient? This one. Why? Because you return to baseline behavior

[26:27] faster. Now toughness is a different thing which is how much does it take before I have this decrease.

[26:39] And then there's a third vector which I'll find the word for it. But when you do have the decrease,

[26:43] how low do you go? To me the ideal scene is that. And the thing is is that all of these things

[26:53] are happening throughout this whole period and the other people in your lives are doing this.

[26:58] Right? Or they're just doing low and they just never recover. Which we've all met those people.

[27:02] If you want to become resilient, what are the actions that you take? You say, okay, this occurred.

[27:08] How long will it take me for my behavior to return to baseline? And if my behavior never changes,

[27:13] did it bother me to begin with? And maybe it might have bothered you, but it didn't matter.

[27:18] Because it never changed your behavior. One of the things that will set you apart is the ability

[27:22] to move forward to spite how you feel. This is, you know, Laila's classic her most known quote,

[27:27] which is her mood for all the plant. And I would say like a lot of you guys don't know Laila that

[27:31] well. Laila is one of the most mentally resilient people that I've ever met. And she pulled herself

[27:38] out of a deeper hold than I ever did. She started from a poor family. She had a worse home situation.

[27:44] She had a worse personal, she had, you know, she got arrested six times before she was 18 or 19.

[27:50] Like she, she has worked on her more than any person that I know. Not to say that it's not

[27:55] more than any personal existence, of course, and I have no idea. But if the people that I've met,

[27:59] she has done the most active work and I have learned a lot from her. Let's imagine we're going through

[28:04] this, right? So you've learned the greatest skill of reframing. You've redefined pain in a new way

[28:08] so that it actually could be progress for you. We're willing to endure and take actions

[28:13] that other people aren't willing to take so that we realize that they were never in the race to

[28:17] begin with and it's all about us anyways. And so what's the fourth thing? Does it use zoom out and

[28:21] you keep going? You will die. Months later, no one will care. And so why care about what they think

[28:28] so much when they care so little about what you do? Like take the risk, right? Shake off the losses,

[28:35] shake them off because in the end you live for the story only you can tell to the only person

[28:41] who was there with you the entire time. Which is you. You might as well make it epic because you're

[28:46] you're literally the story writer and the story listener, the story consumer. We're born alone

[28:51] and we die alone. Even if other people captured your entire life they still don't know what was

[28:56] going on in your head. They don't know your intentions. They don't know what you were thinking

[29:00] through every given moment. Only you do that. That's why being able to over time in my opinion be the

[29:06] judge jury execution of your own faith and your own judgment is one of the most valuable things

[29:10] you can do because you're the only person who can say good job. You might win in some circumstances

[29:15] and not have tried to me that's a loss because you know you could have let you could have put more

[29:21] in. You didn't empty the tank, right? You left someone on the field. The other extreme,

[29:24] if you fall in a logical thought path and you did you move mountains to try and accomplish something

[29:30] and if you actually had exhausted every possible path that you could think of truly beyond

[29:34] cost that we're not that were not worth the price of whatever you were trying to get, you exhausted

[29:40] all of the paths that were worth it and you don't get it. Other people may have said that you lost.

[29:45] But you know there's nothing else you could have done. And so you can still say good job because

[29:50] of the effort that you just put in. I have a few frameworks for zooming out that I think may help

[29:54] you. So one of my favorites is the frame of the veteran, which is okay, something that happens.

[30:00] If it happened a thousand times in a row, how would I feel about it a thousand times?

[30:05] Why probably be like, well, this is just how things are and it would no longer bother me. And so

[30:09] if no longer bothers me then, then it means it's a choice for it to bother me now. So I'm not as

[30:14] choose not to have it bother me today. The second frame is cosmic relevance, which is basically zooming

[30:18] out so far that you realize that we're just a tiny little marble in a galaxy and humans have

[30:24] only been alive for this tiny sliver of time throughout the billions of years. And the likelihood

[30:28] that your boss saying something mean or some person on the internet saying something snide or someone

[30:32] making a video just hating on you or some parents not approving of your current life path or somebody

[30:40] trying to discredit you for not being legit does not matter. And to the third one, this is a

[30:48] really good one for gratitude, is it all considered the grandfather frame, which is basically

[30:55] you zoom all the way to the future, you're 85 years old. So you're old man, you're pain,

[31:02] everything hurts, you don't have the energy used to, you're slashing over and you're counting

[31:08] and then you imagine yourself waking up in whatever age body you have right now. And you turn

[31:13] to your, you're right here left and you see your wife and you're like man, she's so young,

[31:17] I couldn't you can't believe she's so young right now. You look out the window.

[31:20] You know, man, this is before they develop this whole area and we have for it all these high

[31:23] rises. And then you like you get out of bed and you're like, oh man, like I'm not in pain,

[31:28] you know, and you wake up and you're like, you know, I don't feel like foggy, I feel like my memory

[31:32] sharp, I'm like a muckute, I know what I'm going to do and you're like, wow, this is amazing.

[31:37] And the thing is, is like nothing good has even happened yet because life just gets so much

[31:42] heart-risk you get older. You can imagine how like gratitude comes from a matching

[31:45] a terrible thing and then removing that thing that was terrible. That is gratitude. Like how

[31:50] do you operational that gratitude, imagine something terrible, and then remember that that

[31:54] terrible thing has not occurred. That's gratitude. We were like, oh man, I'm so good from

[31:58] my health. How do you get grateful for your health? Imagine that you have cancer and they

[32:00] are about to die and they realize that you don't have cancer and they're like, wow, I'm grateful

[32:03] that I'm a cancer. But you have to put that thing in there. You have to imagine that terrible

[32:07] thing. You have to go all the way there. I'll tell you something that happened recently.

[32:11] Lila had a doctor's appointment for something and I was corresponding with our EAs

[32:18] and I said, you know, how everything going and my EA responded, she is cancer and I was like,

[32:26] okay, got it. This is reality now. Okay. Like, and then obviously I'm texting back like,

[32:35] what kind of what's going on? Like, do I need to be there? You know what's up?

[32:38] And then she was like, oh my god, I'm so sorry. I meant the person who was the front desk,

[32:42] the reason they messed something up was because she had cancer, not Lila. And I was like,

[32:48] got it. It's what ended up happening was that Lila ended up having, you know, something that

[32:55] she was dealing with and they figured out what it was. So it wasn't good news. But what had framed

[33:00] that bad news was that she was potentially on her deathbed. For me, I was just incredibly grateful

[33:06] that she didn't have cancer. And so it just gave me this really wonderful frame by accident of

[33:11] like, it could be worse. You're not dead. The fact that you were alive is living proof that you

[33:18] can endure it. And the day that something kills you, you won't have to anymore. Your life every day

[33:24] exists this evidence that you can handle everything that has come your way. And I think that if you've

[33:30] ever had any need for evidence, let that be the greatest evidence of all. A while back, there's a guy

[33:36] who had like, broke up with his girlfriend, his grandfather died and like, I think somebody else

[33:39] in his family had two deaths in a breakup and he's like, how do I keep going? And I was like,

[33:45] you already are keeping going. Like, you don't need any answer for me. Every day you're living proof

[33:51] in the fact that you haven't heard. When I need advice, I'll be real with you. Like,

[33:55] everybody here, you know, everybody's listening to this like being vulnerable, right? You know,

[33:59] with other people, it's tough. And I think there's some reasonable reasons why. One is like,

[34:04] you don't want to be a burden to somebody else. Number two is like, you don't want to be that

[34:06] person who has just like emotionally dumps another. It's like, that's not good. And at the same time,

[34:11] like, if you're going through hard stuff, especially if it's related to other people, people don't

[34:14] forget the hard thing that you're dealing with with somebody else. And so you might end up getting

[34:18] out of that and forgiving the person or whatever. But the person who tell will always remember,

[34:22] and sometimes it's difficult to like, let's say you have an issue with your spouse. Who do you tell?

[34:26] Right? Do you want to tell your homies? I don't know. I feel a little bit of a breach of

[34:30] kind of like the the marital covenant. You're not going to tell your employees, right? You don't

[34:35] want to tell your family because then they're going to start, they're going to see your husband or

[34:39] your wife differently. So who do you tell? Because you can tell therapist, but maybe don't want to

[34:42] do therapy because you don't like it. Who do you tell? Who do you get advice from? And so I'll give

[34:46] you who I think about this and, you know, unfortunately, the more status you accrue, the more valuable

[34:52] dirt on you is. If you're going through a hard time, the more people will want to gain that

[34:58] information to use it to their own advantage. It's what actually makes it even lower. I use

[35:05] Solomon, frame, as my way of getting the therapy that I think is helpful. The reason I call

[35:13] Solomon is because there's thing called the Solomon paradox, which is, there's a human tendency

[35:17] to be better at offering wise advice to others than it is to apply that same wisdom to our own

[35:22] situation or own lives. They called the Solomon paradox because Solomon was this big wise guy,

[35:26] but he actually has life was a bit of a mess. It's almost like Merlin could see the future

[35:30] for everyone except for himself. The way that I use this is I think I want to imagine talking to my

[35:36] 85-year-old incredibly wise self or at least wise or the name now. And I ask him what he thinks I should

[35:42] do. And what's weird is it takes you out of your current frame and puts you in this other frame

[35:46] and you become more objective about your current situation. I actually had a conversation with a

[35:51] business owner who's out here in Vegas at one of our viseur pectus events. And she said,

[35:58] I've got all these businesses, not really sure what I should do, blah, blah, blah. And she happened to

[36:02] have like a business academy as one of her businesses. And I said, let me reverse the tables on you.

[36:06] I said, let me pretend to be a business owner and I'm going to say back to you everything you just

[36:10] said. What do you think you should do? She's like, well, yeah, I mean it's obvious when you think

[36:13] about it like that and I'm like, right, it's obvious. It's only difficult for us because our

[36:17] judgment is clouded by our emotions because we have emotional contacts. We have emotional

[36:21] ties to the people or the situations or the investments. You can be like more logical decision-making

[36:27] is a good thing. By pulling out and thinking about your 85 year old self, you're able to be less

[36:32] emotional about the current situation without sacrificing any kind of confidentiality because it's still

[36:37] you talking to you. You don't have to waste any time giving context or and let's be real if you

[36:43] know how to persuade people, you can jade your data that you give to somebody else so that they give you

[36:50] the answer that you want rather than giving them the whole picture which you might be embarrassed to

[36:55] share. In my opinion, this framework of having these conversations and to be fair, I don't do it all the

[37:00] time. I do what I need it. If I'm like, man, I gotta work through this. I just have this little chat

[37:04] that I open up and I just start writing through like a DM to me in the future and I literally just

[37:09] bet, you know, enter space, enter space and that includes me mocking my younger self, which I do frequently

[37:15] or at least my 85 year old self does. In my opinion, it has been more helpful than therapy because

[37:19] you have all the context. This is how it makes significantly better choices when I feel like I have

[37:24] emotionality that could be affecting me. To do a call back to the clean and dark energy thing,

[37:30] there is a lot of judgment online about how people choose to work, what fuels them, which fundamentally

[37:39] is it reward or punishment? Are they going away from a versus stimulus or towards, you know,

[37:44] positive one? The answer in my opinion doesn't matter and what I mean by that is, I think the first

[37:52] rule of all entrepreneurship is to use what you have because that's not going to change. Today,

[37:58] you have what you have. There's the only resources you have available to you. You must become

[38:02] more resourceful and that means that if you have shame and people tell you shame is bad,

[38:07] in what world could shame be good. If the shame you have creates this amazingly positive thing

[38:15] in your life, was it bad? If you're dead not hugging you enough, created the catalyst for you

[38:20] to go to the gym and live 20 years longer because you work out regularly, was it bad? Do we need

[38:26] to label it at all? All we know is that it happened and so what? There are these actions that

[38:31] increase the likelihood that you get what you want. Whether you do them because you have some negative

[38:37] thing or because you're going towards some positive thing, I think for the vast majority of people

[38:41] is narrative. They only, they'd create the story. If I said, hey, why did you do this thing? We are

[38:47] trained to give an answer, but that answer may have zero grounding in the truth, not because you live

[38:53] because you have no idea because most people don't know why they do what they do. They just do it

[38:57] and then they describe a reason afterwards. We know that it's mostly BS and you're not going to have

[39:02] a double-blind, controlled placebo study on your life to be able to determine what the true

[39:06] root cause of was this the dependent variable. If you're not going to be able to do that anyways,

[39:11] who cares? Use whatever you've got to get whatever you want. If you behave your thing for this,

[39:17] it's like you might be going through something difficult or hard to use in a bad day or bad

[39:21] moment. I've heard this saying, it drives me absolutely bananas, which is that bad things come

[39:25] in threes. You want to hear this? I so heartly disagree, but I will explain why I believe that

[39:31] saying is the same. Bad things do not come in threes. Bad things occur. People do not know how to cope.

[39:37] They allow one bad thing to snowball into more bad things. And bad stuff sucks. And the only thing

[39:42] worse than the only one bad thing, be a bad thing is to let one bad thing ruin many good things.

[39:47] If you think about a bad thing as a cancer, it's like, well, we want to isolate that cancer as fast as

[39:52] possible and not let that cancer of you losing your job affect your marriage and then let you

[39:56] affect your marriage affect how you're, you know, parent. And let, you know, how your parent

[40:00] affect how you are going to pursue this new endeavor. People just basically give themselves an excuse

[40:06] for misbehaving. I had a bad day. Therefore, I now have a legitimate excuse for being a bad

[40:11] husband or not being nice to my wife. They use it as an excuse to not exercise self-control.

[40:16] And that is when things snowball. This is why resilience is so important. Can something bad happen

[40:21] and I recover before I talk to somebody else? When things get bad, it looks like this.

[40:26] Something bad happens. Something else bad happens. Something else bad happens and it keeps going

[40:31] down. Until eventually everyone in your life that is good has removed themselves and then you

[40:35] slowly recover or you don't recover at all. And you've seen these people. He lost his job. He gained

[40:41] weight and man. He's just never been the same. Pull your head out of your ass. There's this

[40:45] Buddhist parable. I've been actually looking a lot more in the Buddhist lately. Weirdly enough.

[40:50] The Buddha asks one of his students, if a person is struck by an arrow is it painful?

[40:54] The student nods yes. Then the Buddha asks, if a person is struck by a second arrow,

[40:59] is that even more painful? The student nods again. He's like, yeah, it is.

[41:03] Then Buddha explains in life we cannot always control the first arrow. However, the second arrow

[41:09] is our reaction to the first. The second arrow is optional. A lot of suffering that we incur,

[41:14] like Mark Twain right said earlier, like his optional. It mostly happens in our own

[41:19] mind to things that never actually occur in reality. A useful frame has been like, if it has

[41:23] not occurred yet, I will not worry about it. I used to really obsess about planning out contingencies.

[41:28] And I still sometimes have this tendency. But if you're like, I'm going to play out this. I'm

[41:31] going to play this out. I'll play this out. I'll play this out. I'll play this out. I'll do these

[41:34] different scenarios. In a negative frame. I'm not saying planning is bad. But I'm saying,

[41:37] reminating on negative, you know, potential futures can be negative. By the time something like that

[41:42] happens, number one, it will not happen in the way that I imagine. It almost never does. Number two,

[41:46] I will have different resources available to me at that time versus what I have today. The path

[41:50] will become immediately obvious and apparent to me when that occurs. And if we're really honest about

[41:55] it, most serious thinking doesn't require that much time. But worrying can take all day and all night.

[42:00] With all that being said, sometimes you have to give yourself a little bit of grace. Because in

[42:04] some seasons of life, maintaining is winning. Just not losing ground is the W. You're not having

[42:11] a bad year. You had a few bad days that you're thinking about for the rest of the year. This has

[42:15] been something that I've been really visiting a lot, which is like we think about our lives like this

[42:19] and say, this was bad. All of this was bad. But the thing is, is that these types of labels only

[42:23] happen in the abstract, when zoomed all the way out. And so the flip side is when we're making our

[42:28] judgments, we want to zoom in. Because when we look at this line, our days were like this. I might

[42:32] have had a bad moment or another bad moment. And so I can just say, I had these two bad moments,

[42:38] but I had plenty of good times. And so by percentage, I had 85% good. And I had 15% bad.

[42:46] So all in all, not a bad year. And the reason I think this is so important is I will start how I

[42:51] ended. Oh, and how I started, which is the single greatest skill that you can develop for whatever

[42:57] goal that you're trying to achieve in life is the ability to stay in a great mood in the absence

[43:03] of things to be in a great mood about. I hope this helped.

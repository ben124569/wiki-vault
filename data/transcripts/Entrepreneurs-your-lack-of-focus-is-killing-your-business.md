[00:00] Hi, my name is Alksramozi and I own acquisition.com and our portfolio companies will do $85 million this year.

[00:05] What I want to talk about today is one of the pivotal moments in my life that took me from

[00:12] really just getting into a head-on collision in a DUI and having basically no money to my name to, you know,

[00:18] 12 months later, having $3 million in profits not knowing what to do with it.

[00:23] There was a series of decisions that happened in that period of time that radically transformed my life

[00:29] and so I want to talk to you about one of the more significant ones today.

[00:33] And so kind of like I just alluded to leading into my DUI head-on collision, I had six gyms,

[00:39] two with one partner, I had three with another partner and then I had one on my own.

[00:47] So I had all these kind of weird arrangements that were going on in my life at that time.

[00:52] I also had a partner that I was doing a 50-50 split for dental agency work and another

[00:59] and the same partner we also had an agency together for car practice agency work.

[01:04] I'm also doing in-person gym launches.

[01:06] So that means that I was flying out in-person and doing gym turn around and trying to launch gyms.

[01:13] And at the time I was so stressed that I was drinking probably half a bottle every night just to

[01:20] honestly not to get drugged but just to not be stressed.

[01:23] It took me a really long time to just even like function.

[01:27] You know what I mean in the morning because I was so spread thin mentally.

[01:31] And what I want to kind of talk to you through is some of the decisions and how I thought through them

[01:35] because I don't know where you're at right now and it doesn't really matter what the scale is of what the decisions are

[01:40] because I've made decisions like this at multiple times my life.

[01:42] I ended up going to an attention coach and other sounds ridiculous but I went to a coach to help me manage my attention.

[01:48] And so one of the things that I think us as entrepreneurs we think about all the time is like you know we're managing our time

[01:53] we're trying to be productive and I worked every hour of the day that I was awake.

[01:57] And yet I still didn't have that much money at the time everything was tied up and you know the gyms and all that kind of stuff

[02:02] and cash flow for employees and all that kind of jazz.

[02:05] And this coach had kept telling me you need to you know you need to aggregate your attention and you need to focus

[02:10] you like your spread all over the place.

[02:12] I pretty much just like would not long and listen and I tried to do some of the stuff they told me to do.

[02:17] But I wasn't making I mean I was making some progress.

[02:20] But it wasn't until I drank so much that I ended up getting into a head-on collision about 60 miles an hour on the highway.

[02:29] And I actually walked away from that and it wasn't I didn't hit anyone.

[02:35] I was actually getting pulled over and there was a car that was in the side the shoulder that was turned off it was dark.

[02:42] And so I was looking over my shoulder and just kind of going from lane to lane as I was you know getting into the shoulder as I was getting pulled over.

[02:48] As I was getting pulled over by the cop in the shoulder there's a black car and I just nailed it.

[02:53] And so anyways they say that because I was drunk I was really relaxed and that's why I didn't get any injuries.

[02:59] Who knows?

[03:00] But anyways I stepped out of the car you know I'm getting whatever they do you know sign you know it's time paperwork whatever.

[03:07] And the next day after they looked picking up from jail as my girlfriend not not my wife at the time she was like this guy's a real winner.

[03:17] Anyways and so she picked me up and the next day I have a conversation with him obviously and he's like he's like your lack of making decisions is going to kill you.

[03:29] And I remember I'm saying that to me and he was like the reason you're stressed is because you have all these decisions that you know you should make and you're not making them.

[03:37] I wanted to make this because I wanted to talk about probably the the the second hardest decision I made in my life the hardest decision was quitting my job probably the second hardest decision was was the decisions that I had it was a multitude of decisions that I had to make that I knew I was supposed to make and I just didn't know how to confront them.

[03:52] And it seems like it's a common theme in my life that when I only make decisions that I'm literally confronted with my own mortality and so if you notice that is a common theme among my stuff it's because for some reason I can't get myself to decide to do things unless I literally think I'm going to die.

[04:04] And so I saw this and it became the catalyst for me making a number of changes in my life and so what I did over the next you know really the next 48 hours was a rapid series of decisions that consolidated all my attention into one thing and so that's what I want to talk to you about.

[04:22] So the first thing I did I called up the partner that I had the two agencies with that I said hey I can't do this.

[04:28] I'm doing gym agency work where I'm flying out and doing turn around some doing dental agency work and we're doing car practice to do I was like I can't do any of it.

[04:36] So I'm just I'm out. I just was like I'm out. You can have everything I'm done.

[04:40] It was like okay.

[04:42] And that was a horrible conversation I have because I felt like I was letting a partner down and then I called up.

[04:48] The partner that I had in in the the multitude of gyms more of the gyms and I said hey you know.

[04:58] How can we figure out a way for us to you know walk away I want to do this gym lunch stuff and so we ended up working it out and I basically gave away the gyms.

[05:10] At fire sales numbers more or less I was able to sell two of them successfully in a for a better number but the rest of them I pretty much just gave away.

[05:20] And then the partner that I had that I was going to do gym with I said you know hey I'm I don't I don't want to do this anymore.

[05:28] I need to focus on gym lunch obviously all those conversations did not go you know super well they weren't super well received.

[05:35] But I think I just was only able to have the courage to do it because I had almost died the night before and so it just gave me this massive perspective where I was like am I I'm so afraid of letting these people down that I that I might die and so I ended up making that all those decisions just in a matter of like a day or two.

[05:53] And having those conversations and so I think the the the lesson for me.

[05:59] That I've taken with me that's been the most valuable thing of this is one you won't die when you make those those calls but second a lot of times I feel like when I was a newer entrepreneur and even as I feel it as I accumulate un-unmade decisions right I think we accumulate these unmade decisions are un-un-un confronted conversations.

[06:20] And what happens is there's like a portion of my brain in my decision making my thinking power that just gets allocated to this chunk this decision right that needs to be made that is unmade.

[06:30] That I know I should make and I probably know what the right call is but it's just sitting there unmade and so it's like as we started accumulating these things it's like my my actual amount of of thinking power continues to decrease until it gets to the point where you're so reactive because you have no brain power.

[06:45] And as a small like corollary to that I don't know if you've ever like if you remember when you were a kid and you had like homework or something like that and you were like staring at a math problem you can figure it out and and you know you're staying up late into the night and you're like whatever I'm going to go to sleep and see if I can think about the morning.

[07:01] And then you wake up the next day and you feel refreshed and and you look at the problem and it seems obvious you're like oh duh it's here it is and then it's done right.

[07:09] I feel like that is the that is an expression of having far more attention far more decision making power far more thinking power.

[07:17] Because you can concentrate on this one thing and all of a sudden it seems easy and I think that business in life are a lot like that at least they have been for me where it's like if I feel like like simple decisions are.

[07:29] And in order in amount of effort it's because I am too distracted I have too many things too many unmade decisions too many.

[07:34] Unconfirmed conversations that I need to have and those can be life conversations with the spouse they can be conversations with parents they can be conversations with siblings they can be conversations with business partners they can be conversations with employees they can be decisions that must be made.

[07:46] And I think one of the most powerful things that that I've tried to remember is like I'm only one decision away from changing my life.

[07:52] I can quit my job that is one decision right I can start a business that is one decision.

[07:59] The decisions that we have to make at some point in our life and these are like the crossroads.

[08:03] There's two kind of major major things that I have one is that most people don't regret doing things that regret not doing things and so I know that when I die I don't want to regret not having done things I'd rather do things than fail.

[08:12] So that you do not have the regret and I'll have the experience and having that kind of thought process has been extremely helpful for me.

[08:18] I'll go back to the point of this whole thing when I made these decisions and Laila was with me because she basically said as well after I got off the phone call with the coach she was like if you don't change things she's like I'm not like this this has got a change like I'm not going to be around she kind of indicated that she didn't say directly but I think I understood I could read between the lines.

[08:39] And I valued my relationship with her more than a lot of the other things that we're going on in my life and I could tell that she was a little bit outside of the storm that was Alex Hermozi at the time the storm of chaos.

[08:51] And so, she's like you have to make these calls and so I made these calls physically like phone calls and also these decisions.

[08:59] And what resulted next was really the you know I had to suffer the pain of the consequence of those decisions which was very hard for me.

[09:07] But I felt determined that I had made those decisions. I felt confident and I felt like I had more attention and more bandwidth in my disposal.

[09:15] Because I made the tough calls and I started believing in myself more because I was like man if I can make these calls and I can do this next thing.

[09:21] And so that was kind of I would say the explosion that created the beginning moments of like I can do this after I basically shut down as many different side projects as I could.

[09:31] That's when I went all in on gym lunch and so gym lunch actually was started in 2016 which was probably 2016 into the first half of 2017 was like the worst 18 months of my entire life.

[09:42] And that was also when I coincidentally met Layla my wife.

[09:45] So she saw me at the absolute worst and for some reason decided to stay with me because she believed which is why she'll always have my eternal gratitude.

[09:53] We made this call I ended three partnerships. I sold sold or let go of fire sold.

[10:01] You know at the time I guess if you if you were just trying to number there's but I like 11 businesses or something that was going on.

[10:07] And so this is one of those things where people were like man I have I have so many businesses.

[10:11] You know, etc. And it's like you have to do them in the right sequence.

[10:15] Like I didn't even I wasn't barely making any money and I had all these businesses so I could feel good about my status when in reality I knew that I wasn't that successful.

[10:23] And so it was only one way was like this gym lunch thing is working like all we have to do is just give it our full attention and it will work.

[10:30] At that point I felt so I want to say defeated but I also felt like my my slate was clean right I had clean the slate and like I pushed everything off the side in the face of my of my mortality.

[10:42] That the stress of not making these decisions was going to kill me.

[10:46] And so that's when I just focused full in on on gym lunch and things kind of took off and I think in another video I'll tell you that story of how things actually started there.

[10:56] Because I think it's valuable for a lot of people who are going through it right now.

[10:59] But I guess I wanted to make this video because the take way that I have from that is that I'm always one decision away from changing my life.

[11:06] And I'm often one conversation away from getting my attention back.

[11:11] I'm one decision away from getting all my attention back from where I'm feeling distracted.

[11:15] So I don't know where you're at right now but the most valuable thing that we have is entrepreneurs is not our time but our attention.

[11:20] If we have all of the time but we have a million things going on we are useless because we have no decision making power.

[11:25] We have no thinking power because little pieces of our brain are being allocated these un-unformed, un-finalized decisions that maybe can cost your life.

[11:34] And I don't know.

[11:35] I mean it did almost for me which is why I've been so ruthless with my attention since then.

[11:39] And so and had to invite by consequence so disciplined with my focus.

[11:45] It's not because I'm naturally that way.

[11:47] So hopefully this story will illustrate that to you that this was not something that naturally came to me but was a decision that I had to make to save myself.

[11:53] And so don't know where you're at right now.

[11:55] My name is Alex Somosi.

[11:56] We own acquisition.com.

[11:58] Our portfolio companies now do about $85 million a year.

[12:01] I made this channel because a lot of people are broke and I don't want you to be one of them.

[12:04] And I think that everyone has 100% within their control to become the top 1% in the United States, which is already top whatever percent in the world.

[12:11] So anyways, lots of everyone.

[00:00] What I'm gonna talk about this video is not fun, but it's going to make you a ton of money.

[00:04] And I'm gonna explain why so many of you are leaving massive amounts of money on the table right now

[00:09] and not using your single largest competitive advantage.

[00:13] And these lessons have come hard earned from years in business.

[00:17] I've found it and exited nine businesses.

[00:20] My last one at 46.2 million bucks are current portfolio does over $200 million a year

[00:25] and I make these videos so that you can make money.

[00:27] And the big concept I want to talk to you about is scaling the unscalable.

[00:31] And I'm gonna give you some big tactics at the end of this video after I explained why it's so

[00:36] important why everyone gets it wrong.

[00:38] And so just because in the beginning you can't see how it's going to scale.

[00:41] Doesn't mean it's impossible to scale.

[00:43] I had this girl come up to me at the event ages ago and she was in the fitness world obviously because

[00:49] that's where I was.

[00:50] And she said I do outbound for my business and we do $30,000 a month.

[00:57] But I want to have a more scalable acquisition system.

[01:00] And I was like, why can't you scale outbound?

[01:04] And she's like, well, I mean it requires people and I was like,

[01:06] welcome to business baby.

[01:09] How do you think you're going to scale the deliverable if you had fitness coaching?

[01:12] I was like, people is fitness coaching unscalable?

[01:15] No, you hire and train people.

[01:17] Welcome to the service business which is culture and training.

[01:19] That service, that's how it works.

[01:22] And the fact that you don't know how to do it is what makes it unscalable.

[01:26] Not that physics disproves the ability to scale onboarding or scale handwritten cards.

[01:31] Like, unless you can prove physically that's impossible, that gravity exists differently in your

[01:36] fucking world, then it's not unscalable.

[01:38] You have a skill deficiency.

[01:40] It's unscalable.

[01:41] That's what it is.

[01:42] It's not unscalable.

[01:43] You are unscilled enough to scale it.

[01:46] I remember when I was in weight loss.

[01:49] I would have a lady who would walk in and she would say something like, hey,

[01:53] I don't want to lose too much weight.

[01:55] Right?

[01:56] Or I'd have a guy and this is probably the more common one.

[01:58] They'd say, well, I don't want to look like you.

[02:00] Like, and I'm like, don't worry, you never well.

[02:02] But the point is, they would look at me and say,

[02:06] I don't want to get bulky like you.

[02:08] You have too much muscle.

[02:09] I don't think that looks good.

[02:11] And I'm like, you know you're not going to wake up tomorrow and just be jacked as

[02:14] shit and have trained for 20 years.

[02:15] It's not going to happen.

[02:16] There's going to be a million days in between it.

[02:18] At any point, you could say, I'm just going to stop here.

[02:21] I'm going to try and maintain.

[02:22] But the thing is is that people try and say that they don't want the extreme version of a solution.

[02:26] So they're not willing to do take a step in that direction.

[02:29] And so the same thing happens from a deliverability perspective.

[02:32] They say, hey, you know what?

[02:34] If I do it this way, I'm not going to be able to hit 100 million dollars a year.

[02:37] This isn't scalable.

[02:39] But the thing is is that you're not even making money right now.

[02:42] And you're talking about scale.

[02:44] You're talking about how you're not going to be a fit in your clothes and you haven't even lost weight.

[02:47] You're talking about how you're going to look too bulky.

[02:50] But no one even knows you work out right now because of how you look.

[02:52] And so the same thing in business is that like sure you think.

[02:56] And here's the real real is that when you start, you don't have context and you don't have resources.

[03:02] So with your current set of resources, the unscalable thing looks unscalable because you have no help.

[03:07] And you have no money and you have no leverage.

[03:10] But good friend of mine, Andy Frisela, he has first form.

[03:12] They do hundreds of millions of dollars a year in revenue.

[03:15] When he started the business, he started writing handwritten cards to every single person

[03:19] who bought their products.

[03:21] Now in the beginning you'd be like, you're the owner.

[03:24] How could you write handwritten cards to every single person that buys the product?

[03:27] That's not scalable Alex.

[03:28] But guess what?

[03:30] He still does it today and they get a zillion orders a minute at this point.

[03:34] But what did he do?

[03:35] Well in the beginning he was writing the handwritten cards.

[03:37] And there were times he just signed the handwritten cards.

[03:40] And then finally other people writing the handwritten cards.

[03:42] And the gesture still held.

[03:44] And so the thing is there's a 2.03 point no version that can still check 80% of the boxes.

[03:49] That you learn from the unscalabosolution.

[03:52] I got on the phone this last week with a recent founder who has an exited a fintech company for

[03:57] $2.5 billion.

[03:58] Some of you guys saw my story.

[03:59] I've been trying to talk to people in that space.

[04:01] If you don't do this, somebody in Neo banking,

[04:04] I'm paying for processing who had a big exit.

[04:06] Please set me up.

[04:07] I'm trying to learn some stuff for one of our portfolio companies.

[04:09] But anyways, he was saying, hey, it's all about the unscalabone.

[04:13] And he and I had this great chocolate about this.

[04:15] That so many business owners are unwilling to do the heavy hard work.

[04:20] The one-on-one calls the talking to customers in the beginning because they say it's not scalable.

[04:24] But there's always a version that presents itself two-three steps down the road because you have

[04:29] them money and the skill to be able to say, hey, what are the key components of this thing that can make it scalable?

[04:35] And so I would encourage you.

[04:37] If you're starting the business, and let's say you're selling, because I'm obviously in the school community.

[04:41] Right? And so I see people who are trying to sell a $20 monthly community.

[04:45] And they're like, why don't I hop on the phone for a $20 monthly sale?

[04:48] Also, first off, guess what, genius?

[04:50] I was in the large fitness world brick and mortar.

[04:53] What do you think gym membership sell out?

[04:55] Do you think they have a person selling it?

[04:56] The front desk?

[04:57] Sure, shit, they do.

[04:58] Guess who it is, and the owner.

[05:00] And they can still scale that process.

[05:03] And so, again, the idea that things are as scalable is ridiculous.

[05:06] Now, sure, you're not going to be able to take 20 calls a day in the, you know, at scale.

[05:11] But you're currently making $0.

[05:14] So what the fuck are you doing all day?

[05:16] You can't be busy and broke.

[05:18] Pick one, right? You're either busy and you're making money, because you're doing the right stuff,

[05:22] or you're broke, but you got plenty of time.

[05:24] Like, you can't have both problems.

[05:26] And so, if you're broke, get busy and do some of the unscalable stuff.

[05:31] And that means hopping on the calls with customer that are below your ticket price.

[05:34] But guess what that happens is that you're learning more from them than you are earning from them.

[05:38] And that's okay, because you're going to learn the pain points that are suffering from.

[05:42] You're going to learn the hooks in the messaging that matter most to them.

[05:45] You're going to learn how to alter your product and your offer in a way that makes it convert

[05:49] at a higher percentage.

[05:50] You're going to learn the things they don't care.

[05:52] By the way, you want to do magic questions.

[05:53] You're some pro-tip for you.

[05:54] The first thing you ask a customer is you say, hey, if I were to eliminate all of the things that I have

[05:59] in my feature set except for one, what would it be?

[06:03] And they'll tell you.

[06:04] And if you ask 100 people, you'll get by far a power ranking for what matters most in terms of value

[06:10] for the core deliverables you have.

[06:11] Now, you can also ask the second, the inverted version of that question, which is, hey,

[06:15] if I were to eliminate one thing for my entire feature set and it changed nothing about your

[06:18] life which one would it be.

[06:20] And you'll also get the least valuable thing.

[06:21] And between both of this elements and if you do this on a regular basis, you continue to cut

[06:25] and trim and distill down the value they provide to the most amount of people by simply asking them.

[06:31] And so I think Paul Graham said this and I believe this and I keep repeating it because I think it's so important.

[06:35] Is that you can solve every question and every problem in business by talking to your customer more.

[06:42] You have a marketing problem, talk to your customer, you have a product problem, talk to your customer.

[06:46] Like they know what they want and they will tell you how to address them and how to advertise to them.

[06:51] And so getting on the phone and doing the quote unscabled, writing the handwritten card on boarding

[06:56] every customer even though it's $10 a month that they're paying.

[06:59] Guess what happens when you onboard those customers?

[07:00] I'll bet you they're going to stay longer.

[07:02] I'll bet you the refer more people.

[07:04] And you're going to be able to make the product better and the marketing better.

[07:07] And so even if you do that, now let's say okay Alex, oh my god, I apologize and now I'm taking

[07:12] 20 calls a day. Well guess what, now you're making money and I don't give a shit.

[07:15] But if you're still like hey I want to make a woman like fine.

[07:17] I'll give you the next step.

[07:18] So when you go from 101 you go to semi-private.

[07:22] You do what on six, right?

[07:23] You can still deliver a close to that experience but you six X your output.

[07:26] So instead of talking to 20 people a day, you talk to 120 people a day.

[07:30] Now if you're like, wow, 20 people a day, that sounds like a lot.

[07:33] Guess how Alex learned sales.

[07:35] I did 4,101 closes, not consoles.

[07:38] Closes over a multi-year period from my gyms.

[07:40] Why? Because I had appointments back to back to back to back.

[07:44] And I had two to three people that were scheduled for every 30 minutes.

[07:46] And so that accounted for sure, right?

[07:48] So that no matter what, I always had one to three people who were showing up every 30

[07:52] minutes that I pitched the exact same thing to.

[07:55] And guess what happened?

[07:55] I got pretty good at sales.

[07:56] The amount of people who asked me hey, what sales training did you go to?

[08:00] I didn't.

[08:01] I went through the unscale, but sales training of actually just selling a lot of people.

[08:04] And so the idea is that you are going to learn more than you are going to earn in the beginning.

[08:10] And that is okay because as long as you see entrepreneurship as a continual journey of

[08:14] educating yourself on your customer, the problems that you're trying to solve for them,

[08:17] why would you not want to fast track that and Jam is much of that as you possibly could

[08:21] from the best possible teacher that is in the marketplace, which is the market itself?

[08:26] And so I get passionate about this because I see so many poor people trying to think that they're

[08:30] thinking like rich people when they're really thinking like poor people because they're trying to be

[08:33] broke and not busy.

[08:36] So get busy.

[08:37] Talk to the customers even if they pay you 10 bucks a month, you'll learn more.

[08:42] And then guess what happens after you do one on six?

[08:44] You do group onboarding.

[08:46] You do one on 20.

[08:47] You do one on 30.

[08:48] And guess what you can do from there?

[08:49] We have a company right now that still does that did group onboarding and scale to 100 million

[08:52] plus a year.

[08:53] All right.

[08:54] And we still did it because we knew the onboarding was such an important part of the process

[08:57] for sitting expectations.

[08:58] Tell them what was going to happen next.

[08:59] Keep setting promises and keeping promises over and over and over again.

[09:04] And so if you have one on 30, fine guess what?

[09:07] You can still do six.

[09:08] Those are 180 people a day with just one person.

[09:10] And if you train somebody and what happens?

[09:12] Like let's really think through this in the beginning you do the one on once.

[09:15] Okay.

[09:15] Now in the beginning you're just answering questions.

[09:18] Over time you say, okay, most people have these same six questions.

[09:21] And so then I'm going to create a little presentation around these six questions.

[09:24] And so then you start using a presentation in the one on one.

[09:26] So you're like, you know what?

[09:27] I think I can do this a little bit faster.

[09:28] And so you get the one on six there and you have the presentation.

[09:31] And you're still seeing the same output with the one on six is your worth the one on one.

[09:35] Fantastic.

[09:35] Now what do you do?

[09:36] You see can I get to 30 and you do 30 and then you five X again.

[09:39] You're six X output.

[09:40] And again, now you're like, huh, I wonder if I can teach somebody else to go through the same

[09:44] deck is me.

[09:45] And you know what?

[09:46] You do.

[09:46] And just like that, you scale the fucking unscalable.

[09:49] Real quick, if you're tired or being broke and would rather be busy, join me at the school

[09:53] game.

[09:54] So school dot com for slash games.

[09:55] I take a call every week and there, I hope you build your business step by step.

[09:59] We have once a month a mastermind that I drop in there of all the people who fly up from

[10:02] the top 10 communities that are making money online right now.

[10:05] And we break down all the taxes that they're doing right now so that you can use them

[10:08] too.

[10:09] And so the reason that you have to do the unscalable stuff is that there's a swamp in business

[10:12] where you don't have enough money to pay somebody else, but you still have to do your

[10:17] day job and the next job.

[10:18] And so you just have to work overtime.

[10:21] And that means you work today's job and tomorrow's job so that you can get ahead.

[10:24] And so the thing is, is that every single business, hear me out, every single business

[10:29] incurs debt.

[10:30] So the question is what type of debt do you want to incur?

[10:33] So a venture back company incurs financial debt so that they can have lots of talent,

[10:37] upfront, they can get really smart people and pay them where they should be paid at market

[10:42] rates.

[10:43] Now if you don't have that money to pay all those good people, guess what kind of debt

[10:46] you incur?

[10:47] Management debt.

[10:48] Because you don't have the right people because you can't afford to pay them.

[10:50] And only have management debt.

[10:52] What does that mean?

[10:53] It means that you have to work the job of two, three, four people and that's what makes it

[10:56] quote unscalable.

[10:57] But you have to go through that swamp in order to get to the other side.

[11:01] And one of the big problems is that people look 10 steps ahead and then project that

[11:04] back to the present.

[11:05] It's the same thing as saying, hey, I want to get rich so I'm going to go start flying

[11:09] private.

[11:10] It's like Warren Buffett wasn't flying private to get rich.

[11:14] He has done that as a result of being rich.

[11:17] It's not the path that got him there.

[11:19] It is the outcome of being there.

[11:21] And this is actually one of the big issues I see at large with a lot of the information

[11:24] that gets put out there is that what happens is people grind and they sacrifice a time.

[11:30] And then they get rich and then they have a different demand on their time.

[11:33] And then they extrapolate and they give advice of their current setting to people who are

[11:36] not in their current context, which is try it.

[11:38] Why I try to spend a lot of time with people who are making a first 10k, first 100k,

[11:42] first million dollar a month.

[11:43] So I can remember what it's like to be at each of those levels so that can make sure

[11:47] that what I'm saying is contextual to the current constraint of the business that you're in.

[11:51] And I'll give you a super tactical example of this in companies that we still to this day

[11:55] who do tens and hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue is that I know just like you

[11:59] do, if I get a green text that clearly is from a chat interface for a sales wrapper and automation,

[12:05] I'm way less likely to respond.

[12:07] If I get an eye message, I'm an Apple user.

[12:10] And so I know that this is a real person on the other side.

[12:13] And so what do you think I have our sales teams do?

[12:15] Do we use the interface or do we do the unscalable?

[12:18] Yes, guess what?

[12:19] We send a personalized voice note.

[12:21] We send a personalized video.

[12:22] We send it via eye message from a personal phone.

[12:25] Now does it mean that they have to have a personal phone?

[12:27] No, I don't need to use their phone.

[12:29] I can buy them an iPhone.

[12:30] Again, there's leverage.

[12:32] There's leverage in the beginning.

[12:33] You're like, what am I going to do?

[12:34] Buy everyone an iPhone?

[12:35] Well, eventually.

[12:36] Yes.

[12:37] But in the beginning, you don't have money.

[12:38] And that's okay.

[12:39] But you think that something isn't scalable because you don't have the context from which

[12:42] to scale, but if you had unlimited money and unlimited talent, you absolutely could scale.

[12:47] And so just don't use that as the excuse to not do the thing that you know would work better

[12:50] because you have to be more efficient, per lead, per opportunity when you're small.

[12:56] And so you have to pull out all the stops.

[12:58] Gary Hopper, this is an amazing story about this.

[12:59] He says, whenever I want to write a sales letter, I imagine that I can only write one letter

[13:05] for my life where I'm going to die.

[13:07] And so he says, if I, if he starts with that hypothetical Mac, saying, if that's what

[13:12] I had to do, what would I do?

[13:13] He's like, well, first, I would have a handwritten envelope that I'd handwrite the name on it.

[13:17] I'd have a stamp that I would lick and put on it on the inside would be a handwritten letter

[13:22] from me and then the words themselves would be all these things and I'd have some lumpy

[13:25] thing in there.

[13:26] And he starts the hypothetical extreme because if you only have enough money to send

[13:29] 100 letters, then fucking handwrite all of them.

[13:33] Right?

[13:34] Now over time you're like, okay, this worked.

[13:36] How do I scale it?

[13:37] But guess what?

[13:38] Now you've got the sales from you writing 100 letters and guess what?

[13:40] You have the skill of writing 100 of those letters and obviously you start to evolve

[13:44] a system for how you write those letters and you expand your capacity to 500 letters

[13:47] and you five extra income and you're like, okay, now what are the elements of my unscalibous

[13:51] solution that the highest effect are impact on the throughput?

[13:55] Well, 80% of this stuff didn't have as much of the impact.

[13:58] This 20% did.

[13:59] I can use cash from my earlier, less scalable thing to create more leverage in the more scalable

[14:04] thing and get 80% of the effects and 10 times the output.

[14:08] So it still makes sense.

[14:09] And so you always are going to lose efficiency at scale.

[14:12] But the question is, in the beginning, start with the absolute most efficient process and

[14:16] this is fundamentally the opportunity for all starting or smaller business.

[14:20] And when I say small business, I'm saying 10 million and under.

[14:23] All right, so don't get your ego all up.

[14:25] Like, I'm a 7-figure honest one.

[14:26] I don't give a shit.

[14:27] The point is, is that you're not, you're not Apple.

[14:29] You're not a three trillion dollar company.

[14:31] You're not Microsoft, right?

[14:32] So you can do things that they can't.

[14:34] That is the advantage of the small business.

[14:36] And that is why there will always be small businesses because they can do things that

[14:40] big businesses can't because they don't scale.

[14:42] But the fact that they don't scale 100% is 100% you're opportunity to beat them.

[14:47] If you're not doing this, it's like getting dealt pocket aces and then choosing to fold

[14:53] because you're saying, I can't have pocket aces on every single turn because my next turn

[14:57] I might not get it.

[14:58] And so I have to not use them now.

[15:00] You have them in this chapter.

[15:02] So use them.

[15:03] Use what you've got.

[15:04] The first rule of entrepreneurship.

[15:06] Use what you have.

[15:07] And if you have an advantage, if you're the small fish, then that's the advantage you

[15:11] play.

[15:12] Now, if you come amid fish, then you have other advantages.

[15:14] You have resources, you have a little bit of reputation, and you use those resources

[15:18] to leverage up.

[15:19] So now I've talked about scaling the on scale, but hopefully you're sold on that concept.

[15:23] There's two frameworks that I want to do to you.

[15:25] One is the sales to deliver continuum and understanding the dynamic between both poles.

[15:30] And secondly, the done for you, done with you, do it yourself pyramid.

[15:34] So the first thing is understanding something that I called in the offers book, the sales

[15:38] to fulfillment continuum.

[15:40] And basically, the sales to fulfillment continuum states that the easier something is to

[15:45] sell, the harder it is to fill in general.

[15:48] Now the only main exception of this is technology.

[15:51] But when it comes to services, it's usually, if it's really easy to sell, it means,

[15:56] hey, I'll do everything for you no matter what.

[15:58] Very easy to sell, very easy to make that promise, very hard to deliver on that promise.

[16:02] Now the other side of that is that if I said, hey, you have to do it all yourself, then

[16:06] that's something that's very hard to sell, but very easy to deliver on.

[16:10] And so what I find interesting is that the vast majority of people who are starting businesses

[16:13] try to start on the thing that's the hardest to sell, and I think they have it wrong.

[16:17] I think they have it backwards.

[16:19] And in my career, I've had basically the exact opposite perspective or approach to starting

[16:26] a business or starting a new product line.

[16:27] And so if you're a business owner, I would think about this when you're thinking about selling

[16:30] a new product or starting a new level of service.

[16:33] And if you're someone who's new, then this is going to be starting from zero to selling

[16:36] the first thing.

[16:37] Now the second frame over on this, the first is the sales to fulfillment continue.

[16:41] The second is the order in which you attack it.

[16:44] And so the way that I recommend doing this is falling what I call, you know, like the

[16:49] Tesla model, which is you start at the top of the pyramid with the most expensive thing

[16:53] first.

[16:54] This is typically done for you.

[16:55] So this is very easy to sell, very hard to fill.

[16:57] And that's okay because in the beginning, you don't have that many customers.

[17:00] You don't have them much leapflow.

[17:01] And so you want to maximize the revenue per customer.

[17:04] Now, in addition to that, it also sets you up to go downstream later because you will

[17:08] get the highest percentage of people the best results with done for you.

[17:12] The difficulty is that it's more difficult to scale.

[17:15] Come on and that's okay because again, we're starting out.

[17:18] And when you do this, you develop the SOPs, you develop the products underneath of that larger

[17:23] product that allow you to product ties the service that you're ultimately going to deliver

[17:27] later.

[17:28] As you take on, I'll use an agency as a simple example here.

[17:30] If I took on agency clients and I did everything turn key, well, I'm going to start developing

[17:35] SOPs for lead magnet, developing SOPs for ads, I'm going to start developing SOPs for

[17:39] landing pages and upsell pages and email follow up.

[17:42] All of these things are things that I'm going to have to develop SOPs for.

[17:45] Now, once I have all of these systems in place, guess what happens next?

[17:49] You're from the top of the pyramid to the second layer of the pyramid, which goes from

[17:52] done for you to done with you.

[17:53] Now done with you, you can typically charge a fraction of or less than what you charge

[17:57] for done for you, sometimes a third of the price, a fifth of the price.

[18:00] But by doing that, you've product ties to great degree of the service and then you switch

[18:03] from a service provider to a consulting relationship.

[18:07] You're helping someone do it themselves, but you're still there to assist.

[18:11] So that's kind of in between the total not even handholding it's hand doing to handholding

[18:17] to no hands touching, which is doing it yourself at the end.

[18:20] And the thing is, is imagine the opposite version of this.

[18:22] From a branding perspective, you've positioned yourself, you've priced anchored the most

[18:26] expensive version of your service that has the highest results with the best customers.

[18:30] And so you already have this strong association at the top of the pyramid, which then

[18:34] allows you to go and say, hey, listen, I have 10 private clients.

[18:38] They all pay me $10,000 a month to do whatever it is.

[18:41] And I have a lot of you guys who are asking me, but you don't necessarily qualify for my

[18:45] private client service.

[18:46] And so I decided to take all the stuff that I have for my private client service and make

[18:50] it available to you.

[18:51] And I'll help you walk through the process that I walk through with them.

[18:53] But instead of me doing it, you could do it for yourself, but I will be there every step

[18:57] of the way.

[18:58] And by offering that, you are able to sell 10 times the amount of people because the amount

[19:02] of handholding in terms of support that you have to offer is one tenth of you literally

[19:05] doing it.

[19:06] Now, from there, again, you say, hey, there's a lot of people who know my private

[19:11] clients, they can't necessarily afford that.

[19:12] And they can't afford this thing, but they have their enterprising.

[19:15] And they want to take things on their own.

[19:17] And so I take all the SAPs and stuff.

[19:19] And I will give them to you so you can just follow along and do it on your own.

[19:22] And that's one tenth or one third of the price of my done with you.

[19:26] And so I prefer the top down approach to the bottom upper approach.

[19:30] Because let's play it the other way.

[19:31] Hey, I've got this really cheap thing, right, that I've been selling to everybody.

[19:34] And I have, you know, everyone in there and their mother takes it.

[19:37] Now I'm going to start helping you through it.

[19:39] Now, to be fair, I don't think there's anything necessarily wrong with that.

[19:41] It's said that if I had a preference between which one I would prefer to build, I'm going

[19:46] to have the least operational drag at the top because I have the fewest number of customers.

[19:51] And then I have more customers and then I have the most customers.

[19:54] And as I move my way down the pyramid, it gets harder and harder to sell.

[19:58] But my skill in sales improves, right?

[20:00] Because I'll know the customers off, talk to them, I'll spend time with them.

[20:03] And so my messaging can improve and get better and better.

[20:06] All right, that's what I had.

[20:08] That's my money message of the day.

[20:09] Is that skill the unscalable, start there, stop being, stop being broken, not busy, and

[20:15] get busy and you won't be broke for a long.

[20:17] And if you liked this, then I have a whole video that breaks down all my business lessons

[20:21] from 13 years in business, which you can watch next.

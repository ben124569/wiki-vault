[00:00] The top 1% of business owners aren't smarter than you.

[00:03] They do things differently.

[00:04] And that's what I'm explaining in this video.

[00:06] I'm Alex Shmozi, I would act with this Jnaccombe,

[00:07] it's portfolio companies that generate hundreds of millions of dollars per year in revenue.

[00:12] And so I've seen a lot of different patterns across businesses that we both invested in scale

[00:15] and or some that we turned down.

[00:16] If you feel stuck, it's because what got you from zero to 100,000 or 100,000 or a million,

[00:21] or a million to 10 million or 10 million to 30 million,

[00:23] isn't going to be the thing that gets you the next level.

[00:25] And you're probably working on something that was once very important but is no longer.

[00:29] So to make this real, I'm going to give you three examples of my own business experience of what I thought

[00:34] the business I was in versus the one I was actually in.

[00:36] So in the very beginning, I was in to fitness.

[00:38] I got into it thinking that my life was going to be about what workouts were going to be

[00:43] and how is going to structure the weights and the intensity.

[00:45] And then as soon as I actually got into the business, I realized that the biggest issue is most

[00:49] people don't even show up to the Jnaccombe.

[00:50] All of my attention was like, oh my god, I have to get people first in the door and how do I get them to stay?

[00:55] And how do I run this profit?

[00:56] Well, when I've got rent, I've got trainers, I've got equipment that breaks.

[00:58] And all of a sudden, I was like, oh my god, I thought I was going to be in the scientific

[01:03] fitness business.

[01:04] When in reality, I was in the sales and marketing business.

[01:07] One of the easiest ways to identify what business you're really in is to zoom all the way out to

[01:12] the people who are already 100 steps ahead of you.

[01:15] Not just one or two steps, but like 100 steps.

[01:17] And the reason for that is because if I said, if you just look at someone who's one or two steps ahead of

[01:20] you, you should do what they do.

[01:22] The thing is to set their one or two steps ahead of you and they're probably going to get lost too.

[01:25] But if you look at the people who are all the way at the top, typically it's because they've

[01:28] figured out something that you haven't figured out.

[01:31] If you look at the biggest fitness businesses that are gyms, most of them are basically in the sales

[01:37] and marketing business.

[01:38] They have absolutely mechanized the ability of getting people in the door.

[01:42] Their general managers for each location are just people who have membership quotas who are driving

[01:47] sales day in and day out.

[01:49] And so for me, I'd never even sold a poor.

[01:51] I didn't know what a lead was.

[01:53] I didn't know what emo marketing was.

[01:54] I didn't know any of this stuff.

[01:56] And the thing is, is I signed a lease and 30 days later I had to come up with $5,000 and I'm

[02:01] like, how am I going to do that when I was baking people to buy my gym memberships?

[02:05] That was a form of sales, not good sales, but it was a form of sales on the last.

[02:09] All of a sudden through repetition, I was like, okay, so I have to have these

[02:11] consistent conversations that get people to buy and if I do that more effectively than all of a

[02:15] sudden make more money, okay, cool.

[02:17] So this is really important to me, because believe it or not, people don't wake up some day and say,

[02:21] you know what, I'm going to sign up for a gym membership.

[02:24] Doesn't usually happen that way.

[02:26] Usually they got to get interrupted.

[02:27] So they have to get into trouble with some sort of ad and that then reminds them that they're

[02:31] not in the shape that they want to be or they put on their clothes in the morning and like,

[02:35] oh my god, I can't close this thing.

[02:36] But still they don't just say, oh, I'm going to call the gym up.

[02:38] Not usually how it happens.

[02:40] Instead, again, it's other people stopping them in the park and like, hey, do you want to

[02:44] free workout or a thing or showing up to their office of work and saying, hey, we made these

[02:48] protein muffins.

[02:49] Hey, while you're eating these muffins of ours, can I tell you about what some of my

[02:52] private training might do for you?

[02:53] You have to get in front of people in order to ultimately bring them in the gym.

[02:57] The other problem with the gyms that I didn't know I was in is that basically no one sticks

[03:02] with gyms.

[03:03] Now, there's a very small select group of people who are hard core lifters who do absolutely

[03:08] get obsessed with gyms.

[03:08] But here's the crazy part that everyone in the industry doesn't tell you.

[03:12] They are such a small percentage that they're the ones who actually take up all the space in the

[03:17] gym.

[03:17] And if the amount of people that actually were subscribed to the gym, all of them came, no gym model would

[03:22] work at 10, 20, 30 dollars a month.

[03:25] Like, if you actually had people pay who only used it, your gym membership would have to be

[03:29] something like $200, $300 a month, which just so happens to coincide with with the vast majority

[03:35] of service-based gyms, what cross-training facilities and boot camps and similar private training facilities,

[03:40] all of those have clients who all show up and that's why those prices are where they're at.

[03:44] Even a business like crunch or planate fitness, they have $10 a month membership, but they still

[03:49] have like five or six percent per month of their customers who turn out.

[03:53] So that's like half the customers per year are leaving out the door.

[03:57] You've got thousands of customers and you lose half the member year.

[04:00] Guess what else you need?

[04:01] A machine for generating another few thousand customers to fill up the bucket.

[04:06] These very large companies know how to train sale staff, recruit sale staff, market across

[04:11] different channels to get customers in the door.

[04:13] And once I figured that out, my gyms started growing, but until I did, I was like, lost.

[04:19] Might be like, okay, so every business has to be a marketing sales business.

[04:23] Kind of, and so then I got into the sub-emiss business.

[04:27] So this business for sure is about what's inside of the bottle.

[04:30] So I got Dr. Cash, she used the smartest human being that I know, who's a PhD biochemist.

[04:35] Got his PhD when he was 21 years old. He also did the stacks for Olympic teams,

[04:40] and he has a national log restaurant.

[04:41] So I was like, this guy is going to come with the most efficacious product,

[04:44] the best ingredients.

[04:45] And I just said, listen, you make the best thing you could possibly make,

[04:49] I'll figure out how to sell it.

[04:50] That was the business that I thought I was in.

[04:52] The actual business that I was in with supplements is actually in the brand and distribution

[04:57] business. The ugly secret of the supplement business, at least the United States,

[05:01] is that if something actually works, it's most of the time illegal.

[05:06] Because if something works a little bit,

[05:08] then typically if you put a lot of it in, it works a lot of it.

[05:11] Now I think supplements are good for you to filling up holes and nutritional holes and

[05:14] people's diets so that they can get some of these other minerals or whatever.

[05:17] But the thing is, is that if you're a customer, when you have two different proteins that have

[05:22] the exact same calories and macros, what gets you to buy, the brand.

[05:26] And so because every single supplement supplier has access to the same ingredients,

[05:31] more or less is everyone else. And the research studies that are out there,

[05:35] anyone who says that they know the research, the customer certainly don't know what the

[05:38] research is, nor do they really care. What they really care about is, how good does it taste?

[05:44] And do I feel cool when I drink it or eat it? And also like, oh my god, this is not at all.

[05:49] What I spent my entire time building this business to be. Then I'd to learn all the stuff

[05:53] about brand. Now I didn't know anything about brand at that time. And so that business

[05:58] kind of got to what I would consider like a direct sales model. But what I really missed was the

[06:03] cool factor. I didn't understand how to make my products cool. And with somebody's good

[06:07] to buy a creatine for me versus a creatine that's 14 bucks and mine's 60, why are they going to buy it?

[06:13] I didn't have a good answer to that question. And not only that, I didn't have distribution

[06:17] that was convenient. In the beginning for a business like this, you can sell online to consumers.

[06:23] They cover the shipping and stuff. But a lot of times people still like buying supplements in person.

[06:28] Because it's very easy. You don't have to pay the extra shipping. The business that I thought I was in

[06:32] was a combination of sales and making it a great product. But the business I was really in was a brand

[06:37] and distribution business. And maybe like, okay, so that business was maybe different. But the

[06:41] third time he'll definitely get it right. You would hope that. But I didn't. The next business

[06:47] that I had that I wasn't good at was my first software company. At this point when I got into it,

[06:52] I was like, okay, listen, I can market and sell this thing. That's all that's going to matter.

[06:57] Because I had, again, I had learned. I hit everything with the marketing and sales hammer,

[07:00] because that was what I was good at. But when I got into the software business, I realized that

[07:06] you could sell software really, really easily. Because most software solves a problem that's

[07:11] pretty easy to describe. And the technology, especially remove a lot of paint. The problem is that

[07:16] as soon as someone logs in and it doesn't solve that problem or it solves that problem by introducing

[07:21] even more paint into their lives, which is very common, they then immediately hate it and you buy

[07:26] it to fall. I thought I was in the marketing and sales business, yet again, when in reality,

[07:33] I was in the product business. And I didn't know anything about products. From like a software,

[07:36] I didn't know how to write code. I didn't know what UX or design is. Like, I'm still not that

[07:41] good at design. The whole thing was just kind of like screwed from the onset. I didn't have any

[07:46] of the talent in my strategy was not around product. So the fundamental issue with that business was

[07:50] that the product wasn't good enough to deliver on the promise. And the problem was, I needed to make

[07:55] a better product than I didn't know how. I, at the time, hired an outsourced development team.

[07:59] Right. And so I just had them build the product. I was like, yeah, do all the code stuff and, you

[08:04] know, ship it back to me. But the issue that I ran into is a couple things. Number one is that I literally

[08:09] align myself with someone who had a decent Senate to do a good job. So they go as they build hourly.

[08:15] And so their incentive is to charge as much as you can possibly and do as little as possible

[08:20] in that period of time and just keep me on long enough that I don't cancel. Now, the longer you

[08:24] work with the Nauts worth of the Vomitshop, the harder it is to leave them because they have all

[08:29] these developers who are dedicated to your account and they're all red up on the code. You're like,

[08:34] well, I can't switch now because they already have five or ten or twenty developers that are

[08:37] allocated to me. And here's the even worst part. Let's say that you're still really good at marketing

[08:41] and sales. Guess what happens next? They see how much money you're making. They own the damn software.

[08:47] Right. So they can see that you're making money. And you know what's crazy is that I, I noticed

[08:52] as we kept making more money. My fees just kept going up. Wild. Almost so much that I was like,

[08:59] wait, where's my profit? At the end of the day, the Dev Shop was more or less taking advantage of us.

[09:04] And because I had no technical proficiency, nor did I have a co-founder who was really technical,

[09:08] because you can't absolutely have a business like this. Somebody's got to know how to code.

[09:13] Right. Somebody's got to understand technology. And I didn't know it and I didn't have anybody else

[09:17] and a specific, I didn't have anybody else who is incentivized to help. Because in the software

[09:21] business, you can make the promise of good fast cheap and people are going to buy. But you have to

[09:25] fulfill that promise. And that's fundamentally what makes that business so hard, but also so lucrative

[09:31] when you get it right. And so I learned that lesson two late. I ended up selling that company to

[09:35] somebody who did have a fool in house to have team. And I had built because of my sales and

[09:39] marketing ability, a still a pretty decent sized distribution base that he could then leverage

[09:43] with his software and continue to expand the business. So that worked out okay. So I'll give

[09:48] you another example of what business you really have. So I talked to a guy recently who is in the

[09:53] M&A world, so emergency neck positions and he was buying a plumbing business. And so he bought

[09:57] up a plumbing business and I was like okay, well what's limiting the business? And he said, I can't

[10:02] find good plumbers. So I was like, well what's your system for getting plumbers? And honestly,

[10:08] he didn't have one. And so I was like okay, dude, if we think about what the product of this

[10:13] business says, when you're in a service business, the product is the service, meaning the people

[10:18] who deliver the service are the thing you sell. And the margin of the business is the difference

[10:23] between what you have to pay them and what you need to charge for their work. Our acquisition process

[10:28] to scale the business doesn't have to be custom-refacing because you've got a phone string

[10:32] off the hook. There's already tons of demand, there's insufficient supply. And so the question is,

[10:36] what are you doing to outmarket your competition for talent? I introduced him a concept that I

[10:41] love to talk about, which is the cost of acquiring talent relative to the lifetime gross profit

[10:48] per employee. All right, it's a lot of letters. Basically, this is how much it cost you to get people.

[10:53] This is how much you make from them. And so I said, well how much does it, how much do you make

[10:58] from a plumber per year in gross profits? So revenue minus what you pay them, what do you make?

[11:04] You said, probably about 300,000 dollars a year. And I was like, okay, I was like, so what are you

[11:09] willing to spend to get another plumber? And he's like, well, I think we have like a $500

[11:14] referral thing if any of the guys refer somebody else. And I was like, okay, so think about how

[11:19] while this is you're willing to pay $500 for $300,000 per year. This is per year for from your plumbers.

[11:31] I was like, does this feel a little bit low? Of course it did. It's insanely low. Because the

[11:37] thing is, is that if you're a smart competitor, what am I going to do? I'm going to be like, well,

[11:40] shoot, I'll pay $30,000 dollars. So all of a sudden, if I offered $30,000 dollars, everyone in my

[11:45] staff, if they can go get somebody, what do you think's going to happen? They're probably going to

[11:49] find more plumber's for me. But guess what else I can do with $30,000 dollars. I could also say,

[11:54] you know what, I'm willing to spend that in paid ads or in recruiting or head hunting.

[12:01] Of people who just go and post people from firm to firm. How do I know if it's going to work out?

[12:06] Well, if you're doing a referral bonus, you can say that it's after their productive at month

[12:09] six. Now you've got somebody who did the referral who's super invested and making each other works out.

[12:13] Most recruiting firms have 90 day classes to make sure that if the person doesn't work out in the

[12:17] first 90 days, they'll swap them out for free. That's a pretty typical offer. If you're running ads,

[12:21] you don't have to worry about either of those because it's just the cost of the ads. The question is,

[12:24] if the one thing that's limiting this business is that he doesn't have enough plumbers,

[12:28] literally everything that he does with this time that is not about creating an acquisition system for talent,

[12:34] is the thing that's limiting the business. I'll give you a different example. And the reason I'm

[12:38] keeping these examples is because it happens in every business and this is typically what keeps

[12:42] business owner stuck. You start doing something, maybe it worked and then it stops working. But you

[12:46] think, oh, I need to keep doing this thing or do more of this thing when sometimes that's the truth.

[12:49] But a lot of times, it's just that the game changed or the real constraint of the business is not the

[12:54] thing you think it is. So I was talking to a media company, super large YouTube or big creator,

[12:58] right? And I said, well, what's the goal? And they said, we want to build, you know, make more money.

[13:03] I said, okay, great. So what do you think it is right now? And they're like, well, you know,

[13:07] right now, just to give you context, they're a way bigger channel than me. Very big, many millions,

[13:11] tens of millions. I said, what are you doing right now? They're like, well, we think that we've

[13:14] really mechanized our process of creating content. And, you know, we think that we can get this

[13:19] these new levels of efficiency in the concentration. And I was like, okay, so out of a hundred,

[13:27] compared to the marketplace, what would you guys rate your your content out right now? So it's funny

[13:32] is that like they would, they were like, I think we're like maybe a 90, but I'm like, guy, like, if you

[13:36] just do forcentiles here, like your point's juuous juuous juuous, but everybody, when it's your own game,

[13:40] you know so much about it, you forgot more than people who are committing this for two years,

[13:44] know about it. You guys are probably like a 99 out of a hundred on marketing. The issue with your

[13:50] business, despite the hundreds of millions of impressions per week that you're generating,

[13:55] is that you're just not making that much money. So would you really think that doing more

[14:00] media is the solution? And so they looked at me for a second. I was like, what do you sell to make

[14:06] your money? And they were like, well, I mean, you know, we despone such a subject every once in a while,

[14:12] we basically listen that. I was like, okay, do you think it's possible that not having a clear

[14:19] monetization mechanism? Is the issue? What would you rate your monetization strategy at? And they're

[14:25] like, oh, we're probably like a five out of a hundred. I was like, okay, so you've been deploying

[14:30] all your resources to go from 99 to 99.5%. Rather than taking those same resources, and the thing is

[14:37] is that when you're this low, going from five to like 25, probably takes less effort than going

[14:43] from 99 to 99.5. And so what we need to do is fix the monetization of this business. When they

[14:50] had this larger goal, the business that they thought they were in, which is media, but to get

[14:54] to where they want to go, they were going to have to enter into having a business model. They're

[14:58] going to have to enter into monetization as the issue in the business. The problem that most businesses

[15:04] have is they don't know the business they're actually in. And they keep trying to solve the

[15:08] problem that they enjoy solving rather than the one that the business requires to be solved.

[15:13] Every business has a big, very problem. And this has been my experience. It may be just because

[15:16] it took me too long to learn, or I, you know, I only learned about it once I get into it,

[15:21] as a recommendation. So this is a hack of hacks. If you're entering a new marketplace,

[15:26] talk to the people already in that marketplace and ask them with the hardest part of their

[15:31] business is. And a lot of people follow me because they're in education or consulting

[15:34] information products. So think yourself, well, if you're in that world, what business do you think

[15:39] you're really in? Well, if you learn the basics of marketing and sales, just like any business,

[15:43] but if you want to make it big, look at the big consulting firms, look at McKinsey, look at

[15:48] Bay, look at Erson Young, or KPMG, these are all recruiting machines. Because on a long enough

[15:53] time rise, you have to learn how to do other stuff. Because you can only keep selling infinite

[15:58] people for a period of time until eventually you've sold everyone within a marketplace and there's no

[16:02] one left. You've already pillaged the land. Instead, we have to find a way to keep people to keep

[16:07] buying. If it's in the service business, it means having exceptional people. If it's in a physical

[16:10] products thing, it's how do we get customers to come back again and again. If you're in the

[16:15] software business, the same thing, except you're doing a via code rather than kind of recurring,

[16:19] how do we basically engineer consumption? A lot of entrepreneurs who are in the education space

[16:24] and I bring this up because I'm literally educating right now, is that they have one talented person,

[16:27] that they have some guru, and then they hire people who really aren't as good, and then they

[16:31] dilute the service quality over time, and then there's a surprise that somehow there's business

[16:35] stops growing when they were smaller, you're really fast, because you had a good product, which

[16:38] was you, you were exceptional, and then you hired all the other people, and they're not exceptional.

[16:42] But then you're like, oh, I love this one. I decided to stop doing it because it's not scalable.

[16:49] One of my favorite lines to hear. I'm going to try and add to curse. It's going to be hard not to.

[16:56] I'm like really struggling. Motherfucker, they are building cities in the middle of the ocean.

[17:02] We're sending rockets to space and building internet from satellites globally. We have electric cars.

[17:08] We have AI robots and you think that you can't scale service? Of course it's scalable. You're just

[17:17] not good enough. But when you phrase it that way, now it becomes a problem that you can solve.

[17:22] This is a second. Hack if hacks for figuring this out. Insert the problem that you claim to have

[17:28] that is unsolvable and frame it in the form of an I don't know. So for example, no one can sell

[17:35] like me. I hear this all the time. No one can sell like me. What if you said, I don't know

[17:42] how to get anyone to sell like me. Sales people suck. I don't know how to find good sales people.

[17:49] There's no good plumbers. I don't know how to recruit higher train. Good plumbers. All the

[17:55] leads are crap. I don't know how to advertise to get good leads. What does it complain? The other is a

[18:01] question and the question has an answer. And so as soon as you get actually asked the right question,

[18:07] you start walking down the path to getting the thing that your business actually needs rather than

[18:11] you just complaining and giving yourself an excuse for why your business isn't growing anymore. And

[18:15] then you cast all the power out to some external things. And that way you feel good and you can

[18:18] rock yourself to sleep every night saying, you know what? I gave it the good fight. But there are

[18:22] some people who actually want to fucking win. And so for those people who want to do what I'm making this

[18:26] video for, the thing that you're doing right now, if you keep doing it and it's not working,

[18:30] is the wrong thing. So let me give you one that you might not know as much about. So in the investing

[18:35] world, so I got into this. So we lay on our so-called tens of millions of dollars in distribution,

[18:39] then we also sold the company for lots of tens of millions of dollars. And so we had enough money

[18:43] that we could start our own family office and actually start buying companies and investing.

[18:46] I thought investing was about doing lots of deals at good prices. And what's interesting about this

[18:52] is that in some businesses, it does work that way. So like if you were selling cars, a lot of times

[18:57] the price of a Honda 2000, whatever is this. Basically, you're a proprietary way of getting a commodity

[19:03] for less. You're not going to get it by jipping people on the sale. Sure, you want to close every

[19:08] tellers. It's close to it's possible. But you're not going to buy a Honda and then all of a sudden

[19:12] sell it for a hundred grand. So you're going to make more of the money on where you buy and then you

[19:16] make up the difference on the sale at market rate. Whereas in the investing world, this is what like

[19:21] I thought it function that way, but it's soon businesses were commodities. Think about this for a second.

[19:26] It assumed that, okay, I'm just going to try and buy as many businesses as I can and buy them as

[19:31] far as less possible. But the problem is missing is that a really good business can outperform

[19:36] all of your bad ones with one good deal. For me, what I thought I was in was the high volume discount

[19:43] deals. The business that I was really in was learning how to say no at a much higher velocity

[19:48] to a much higher number of deals because you only need one Facebook. So let's confront the real problem.

[19:53] At each stage, I've had these learning curves where I thought I knew what the business was about.

[19:59] And then I realized what it was really about. The big hairy problem that I had to solve. Here's how

[20:04] I think through this. It can be painful because oftentimes we spend so much time trying to solve

[20:09] every other problem that we think we know how to solve rather than solving the one that we know we

[20:14] need to solve but don't know how to. That's a lot of times what makes that big hairy problem so

[20:17] hard is that you just don't know what to do. And this is why so many entrepreneurs start a second

[20:21] business because they're like, I don't know how to solve. To grow this in past this one and then

[20:24] they make up a reason and then they start another business because they think somehow the second

[20:27] business is going to be different than the first. When a reality you're just going to reach a

[20:30] plateau that you don't know and then you're going to stop again. So you have to confront the issue.

[20:33] You have to confront the problem. And so this is how I mentally trick myself into getting to be

[20:37] okay with solving hard problems that I've no idea how to solve. I imagine to myself, this is purely

[20:42] hypothetical. All right. So let's say that I've got a business that's doing $10 million a year.

[20:47] You can use whatever zeroes you want. Okay. And let's say that it's got, you know, $3 million in profit.

[20:53] Okay. So this is top line. This is bottom line, aka profit, leftover, cashier,

[20:58] cheese, cheddar, lettuce, money in the bank account, whatever you want to say. So that's our top line

[21:03] bottom line. Let's say that we've got this big area problem. So we got this big area problem.

[21:12] Now we think that if we solve this big area problem, we're going to be able to continue to grow

[21:16] the business to $20 million a year in top line revenue and that three because we've covered a lot

[21:22] of our base, our fixed costs in the 10 million is actually going to jump all the way to like

[21:26] seven or eight million. All right. And profit. So big, a disproportionate profit increase with the

[21:31] increase in top line, which is not uncommon. So here's what's crazy. This business might be worth

[21:37] somewhere they ever had a $15 million. I'm just going to make an estimate that's a five x

[21:42] on this $3 million. Okay. Now this eight million dollar business might be closer to worth

[21:49] it be like $72 million. That's what they nine x. And so the difference between these two amounts

[21:56] is 57 million dollars. That is a big a lot of dollars. Here's how I'm honestly trick myself.

[22:05] I say, man, this big area problem is big and hairy. But if someone paid me 57 million dollars to

[22:15] solve it, would I be willing to solve it? I'm like, hell yeah, I probably solved our million dollars.

[22:20] And so I've got this nice $56 million surplus of what I'm willing to do it for versus what it's

[22:25] actually worth. I tell our founders in the portfolio I say, once we figure out what this big

[22:30] area problem is, I always try and remember to do this. And I say, hey, if we do this, this is going to

[22:35] lock $50 million dollars in the price value. This is going to lock a hundred million dollars in the price value.

[22:39] If we solve this one problem, there's a common saying in the venture capital world, which is,

[22:42] is this a feature is this a bug? There are some businesses that I will see founders

[22:47] bang their heads against the wall, being like, I have to solve the churn issue in my gym.

[22:53] I have to get it so no one leaves. I can tell you right now, you're never going to solve churn

[22:59] in fitness. You're not going to do it because it's a human problem. It's not a bug. It's a feature.

[23:04] We have to look at what are the features of our business versus what are the bugs of our business.

[23:08] The bugs of the business are the things that you can and should work on that can help you get to the

[23:12] next level. The features of the business is like, this is the core way this business works.

[23:16] If you know for a fact that people are going to cancel fitness because let's face it, people do,

[23:21] then what then becomes the issue. I need to build a marketing machine so that I never run out of people.

[23:26] Now the good news, a couple pieces of good news, if you're in one of those businesses,

[23:29] is that one, some people come back into the business. Right? So if people lose weight or they don't

[23:34] lose weight into a three years, they might still want to lose weight and try again. Whereas there's

[23:38] other companies, let's say you're your internet bill, probably have it switched providers in a

[23:42] while. Who does your banking for you? You've probably been with the same banks since you got a

[23:46] looney to in the account when you were six. And so you've probably had this around the same banks

[23:50] for a while because it's a pain to change and you probably don't care about it. And so for those

[23:55] businesses, they're all about aggregating market share just having a really sticky customer base.

[24:00] But guess what? They have problems too. My former CFO gave me this piece of advice that I just

[24:05] absolutely loved. And I was gripping to her one day about basically features of this business.

[24:11] It's like these are things that are absolutely true about this business. And I was basically

[24:14] just complaining because there's nothing to do about it. And she said Alex, you know,

[24:18] I've been in business and I've seen a lot of different businesses over my career.

[24:23] She said the grass is always greener on the other side because no one sees that's fertilized with

[24:29] it. And she's like, it's all they're all every business has. But the idea is that every business

[24:37] has overhead, every business has stuff that are features and there's bugs, things that are wrong

[24:42] with your service that should get fixed and things that are inherent to the very nature of this business.

[24:46] There's core features inherent to every business and we just have to be able to confront the issue

[24:50] that is at hand and oftentimes it's big, teriy and it sucks. We got to make sure that we're not

[24:55] trying to spend all of our effort trying to fix a term problem that will literally never get fixed

[25:00] because you're trying to ask humans to stop being human. If you think about entrepreneurship

[25:03] business video game, which I often do, all right. So let's imagine we've got these levels here.

[25:08] All right. So we've got level zero. We've got one, two, three, four, five, six, whatever. I

[25:14] probably would lend on seven because seven feels like a better one. But let's let's go with six.

[25:17] Maybe in the very beginning, you have to figure out what you're going to sell. All right,

[25:21] you've got a what? And the biggest issue at this point is that you just can make decisions. You're

[25:24] completely indecisive. You can't commit to anything. You have this fallacy to the perfect pick.

[25:28] You think that whatever you pick has to be the one thing that you're going to stick with the first

[25:31] or your life. But the reality is that you're probably not because you didn't even know what you're doing.

[25:34] But you don't have the perspective from which to make a judgment. And the only way you can gain

[25:37] perspective, which to make a judgment is to actually pick something and then start and then gain more data.

[25:40] You have to do that first. Now let's say that you graduate from that level and you actually made a

[25:44] selection. Congratulations. Now you have something to sell. So then you have to learn advertising one

[25:49] because no one's going to buy your thing unless they know about it. Right? So you have to learn that skill.

[25:53] And every one of these levels, you will have entrepreneurs that just get to level one. And then they

[25:58] they don't learn level two. Let's say that let's let's say level two is they learn how to

[26:03] profit. Right? They learn a business model around it. That they wrap a business around it. Okay,

[26:08] let's say that's that's level two. Well, they get to level one. And then they say, you know,

[26:12] what? I just saw this thing over here that looks easier to scale up. So I'm going to

[26:18] race through level one and level two here. And they do. And here's the craze part. This next business,

[26:23] they do this in one third of the time. And they're like, oh yeah, this was a great idea. I just boom.

[26:28] I look how fast I'm going. And then they crash in the same level again. There's still stuck at

[26:33] level two because they never learned it. The big Harry problem is typically the problem that you need

[26:37] to solve to get to the next level. And it typically requires an entirely different skill set.

[26:41] Most people can't confront that level of uncertainty or that level of dissatisfaction with

[26:46] themselves. And so they just start something else. This is, and I will, I will probably keep

[26:51] repeating this because it needs repeating is that the woman in the red dress, right? She is the

[26:58] distraction. And if you don't know what I'm talking about in the matrix, there's a moment where

[27:06] more thesis training neo, they're walking through a busy city. Then all of a sudden a woman

[27:10] in red dress walked by, more thesis talking. Neo looks back and then more thesis,

[27:15] where you listen to me, where you look into over the red dress. And he looks back at me, he says,

[27:19] look again, he looks again, there's a gun pointed at him. And he says freeze. And he said, this whole point,

[27:25] this training is to teach you one thing, which is that if you're not one of us, you're one of them.

[27:29] The one of us is if it's not the core business, it is the distraction from the core business.

[27:34] Because every one of these other things, every one of these other people in the street,

[27:37] every one of these other opportunities can look attractive because you don't know the shit on the

[27:41] other side, it's the grass's greener. Because it's on the other side of the fence. And if you got close to it,

[27:46] you'd see the manure that you had to sit in in order to get it to grow. The craziest part about all

[27:50] this is that you can be just about everyone if you can stick with something for a few years.

[27:55] And real quick, if you're not sure what level of business you're at right now, I spent 200 hours

[28:02] this year just making this one project for you, which is the $100 scaling roadmap. And a broke up,

[28:09] the stages of business in a 10 stages. And you can identify where you're at by simply just putting

[28:14] in your business information. You go to acquisition.com for slash roadmap. And it'll spit out this custom

[28:18] report that tells you what the constraints are at that current level and what you need to do to graduate

[28:24] and get to the next level. This is our gift to you, absolutely free. And if you're like, I'm not sure

[28:28] what the big here problem is or I'm not sure what business I'm really in. On the thank you page,

[28:31] you can book a call with our team and we'd love to help you figure that out and ideally get past it.

[28:35] Let me conquer a big belief that is common among entrepreneurs. One of the biggest reasons that

[28:43] people will switch from their current business to the next business is two big ones. One is a fancy way

[28:48] of saying it's hard. This is the like, I don't think my business is that scalable. And I'm like,

[28:53] remember, cities, middle of the ocean, rocket ships and space cars that drive themselves robots that are

[28:58] smarter than humans. Really, you think it's not scalable or you don't know how to scale it.

[29:04] Remember, let's flip it into a question. I don't know how. I don't know how to scale it. How do I

[29:08] scale a business like mine? So what is the difficulty thing? The other one that they do is that they

[29:14] will say, I don't think this business can get to the size that I want for myself. Now, I will put a

[29:20] big disclaimer here, which is that if you want to be the richest person in the world, yes, you're going

[29:24] to probably have to do some sort of technology that has mass global appeal and it can't look like

[29:31] any of the technology businesses that already exist because those already exist. So it has to be a

[29:35] true, denovo idea and I'll tell you something else. If your goal is to become a true linear,

[29:40] you probably won't. And the reason for that is because the people who are the absolute richest in the

[29:45] world are missionaries and entrepreneurs. They do it because they genuinely believe that the

[29:50] solution deserves to exist in the world and they're willing to eat glass for a very long time.

[29:55] Now, in your mind, and I say this as also an entrepreneur who has it money goals, in your mind,

[30:01] a trillion dollars is just like you just see that as winning because it's that means that you're the

[30:04] richest person in the world. But like, can you name the richest person in the world 30 years ago?

[30:09] You can't. There's that guy's number one. Can you? It wasn't Bill Gates. Do you know Paul

[30:14] get he was? For just man in the world. 100 years ago. 30 years years rich man in the world.

[30:21] You can't name him. So this idea that you think of becoming the richest man in the world is

[30:24] going to somehow make you immune to impermanence that you're going to. Their life is going to

[30:27] not be meaningful because of the it won't be. And I can also tell you that like a billion dollars is a

[30:32] lot of money. A hundred billion dollars a lot of money. If you're not at that level, like I think

[30:37] having that goal is a bit silly because things will change as resources change. The map and the

[30:43] pieces and the board change as you develop as an entrepreneur. Under the assumption that you have

[30:47] what I would consider to be modest goals of let's say a hundred million dollars. Let's say let's

[30:52] make that our modest goal. All right, so bear with me here. Every business in my opinion can get to

[30:58] a hundred million dollars or price value. You don't want to be clear here. I'm not saying every

[31:01] entrepreneur can get to a hundred million dollars. I'm not saying every every business is it currently

[31:05] stands and gets to a hundred million dollars. I'm saying that there is a version of every business that's

[31:09] maybe adjacent or one or two steps away that can absolutely become it. So let me give you an example.

[31:13] I have a restaurant. I don't think it's scalable and I don't think that I can be a hundred million

[31:18] or well all would all we'd have to do is prove this to say is there anyone who's worth over a

[31:23] hundred million dollars in restaurants? Turns out there is. There's actually a ton of them.

[31:29] In fact, my neighbor above me is worth a deck of billion 10, 10 billion and he owns restaurants.

[31:37] The guy who started subway who's the primary owner of subway. What is a franchise model? The other is

[31:42] privately held. Okay, so you wait. So I definitely have to do for it. You can do either of them.

[31:47] But you have to pick which one you're going to do and you have to go all in for a long period of time.

[31:51] Then you might be like, well, yeah, sure. Subway, well, let's play a fun game. How old do you think

[31:56] subway is? 59 years old as of right now me making this video. How long do you think

[32:04] Andrew Turner in Peggy Turn of Pindex Brass have been doing Pindex Brass? 42 years.

[32:11] And so you're right. The five years you've been making your restaurant is probably not that close to

[32:17] the 59 years that subway has. And you're like, oh, well, maybe I'll be like, check for like 78 years.

[32:23] Can a restaurant business become a billion dollar business as fast as a software company or

[32:30] no. But what do we say your goal was? Say 100 million bucks. That means you have to get about

[32:37] $10 million in profit in the business. Between now and the time you die. Doable. That's not a promise.

[32:45] That's not a guarantee. I'm just saying it's doable. Even if you're like, okay, why have a dry

[32:49] cleaning business? Okay. Well, we can make that into a franchise model and then scale that way.

[32:54] We can privately own them and just keep compounding the business and what is what's that?

[32:58] What business are we really in when we're in dry cleaning? On his truth, I don't know. I've never been

[33:03] in it. What I would do is I talked to a bunch of dry cleaning people we've got what sucks the most about the business.

[33:06] Maybe talents not that hard and directly because maybe the skills of manning a dry cleaning

[33:10] business are not that tough. Maybe the issue is the machines break a lot. And you're actually like,

[33:14] actually, I'm in the logistics and you know, machining business. I need a lot of tech and

[33:17] side of that business. Okay. Well, that's the business you're in. Ask people who are in the business

[33:21] with the hardest part of it is. Oftentimes, they'll give you the big Harry problem. And then you

[33:25] just get to say, is that the type of problem that I prefer to solve? And this is a frame that

[33:28] lately uses a lot that I love when we're, we're helping a number of make a big, a big decision.

[33:33] They'll say, hey, there's these two paths I've been following me. And I'm not sure, should I do the franchise?

[33:37] Should I do the private hell model? Right? Now, the big overarching thing that no one seems to mention is

[33:44] we might ask what's the goal? But what the subtext underneath of that is in what time line

[33:50] because almost all goals are accomplishable on a long enough timeline. Now, back to the two paths.

[33:56] Let's say that you're making that decision. I want to start a franchise, I want to keep

[33:59] probably out. Okay. If this is the path what you want to do is you want to adequately

[34:05] be able to know what the big Harry problem is in each of those paths because there's one in their

[34:10] different. And then you ask the file question, which of these problems would I rather have?

[34:17] Follow up to that is which problem do I feel more quick to solve today? And so that gives you a lot of insight

[34:22] because a lot of times people want to think about the upside, but the downside mitigation is

[34:26] would get you to the upside. Elon has this really great quote that he has from somebody else,

[34:30] but he says, entrepreneurship is a lot like staring into the abyss and eating glass.

[34:34] The staring in the best part is because you're constantly facing the uncertainty of the business

[34:38] and existential risk to the business every single day feeling like it might not work. On the eating

[34:43] glass side, it's that entrepreneurship is the most efficient funnel for having nothing but bad news.

[34:49] So think about it like this. There are problems that are very hard to solve and there are

[34:53] problems that people don't want to solve. You get to have the best of both. As in, you get problems

[34:59] that no one wants to solve and they're really hard. Right? Problems that are hard that people want

[35:03] to solve, they'll still work on them for you. Problems that are easy, the people don't want to do.

[35:07] Ah, you can usually pay someone enough, but like it's solvable. But it's the ones that really suck

[35:12] in no one wants that you get to have. And what happens is this becomes your lens of the world.

[35:17] Because you just think all day, every day is problems that absolutely blow and don't want to do that.

[35:22] But you have to do it because who else is going to do it? It's your business. Every single day,

[35:26] it's just trudging through this muck and you think that somehow another business is going to have

[35:31] different mechanics. But this is a feature of entrepreneurship, not a bug. Entrepreneurship is the

[35:38] mechanics of entrepreneurship and ownership, specifically being CEO, being the person who's calling

[35:42] the shots. That's your life. And that's where you get compensated for. And so there's a lot of

[35:47] romanticism about entrepreneurship. The freedom that entrepreneurship gives you. What depends how big

[35:53] you want to go. Because basically the day that you stop eating glass, the day that you you stop dealing

[35:59] with that, is the day that in my opinion you sacrifice a minute for potential, for comfort. And I think

[36:04] that's okay. The thing is totally okay. But that's a trade you get to choose to make. But the end of the

[36:10] day, I said that there is two big reasons that people say, I think I should switch my business. One is that

[36:13] the business I have is currently on scale. Hopefully I've popped that balloon for you. And the other

[36:17] is that I don't think that this thing could become super big. Well, we have to ask a question how big

[36:23] and why do you want it to be that big? It's just for you, you're probably never going to make it.

[36:26] Because it's too hard and you already have satisfied your material needs. So the reason that there's

[36:31] massive companies existed because the people who started them genuinely thought that it's almost like

[36:35] their purpose in life was to do this service for the world and as a result, the company continued

[36:39] to grow and they were willing to deal with all the glass for that entire period of time. We talk

[36:42] about Jeff Bezos with Amazon. You know, it's only just been like a chill 30 years.

[36:47] Amazon 35. Like we talk about these fast growth tech. Like Facebook's like 20 something years old.

[36:54] And the idea that you're going to have this choice, I want you to know that there is absolutely a

[36:57] version of your business that can become a hundred million dollars. I really change it like

[37:01] I've a very hard time having someone convince me that there's not a version of just about any business.

[37:06] Because there's because of this. No matter how small the niche is, there's 8 billion people in the

[37:12] world. And so with online, we can now access them. This might not have been true 30 years ago.

[37:18] But today, kind of it's anything brick and mortar, you can scale nationally. Now, if you're like,

[37:24] well, I'm in a country that only has 7 7 people. Okay. Well, then guess what? You become international.

[37:28] But are you saying it's impossible or difficult? What do make sure we're clear here?

[37:33] I don't know how to go international. Do you think no one else is going international for?

[37:37] Oh, people have done it. Therefore, it is possible. Therefore, I can learn it. I think about these

[37:40] big Harry problems because this is what, hopefully the entire point of this video is figuring out the

[37:43] business you're really in and being able to confront the problem ahead of you so that you don't

[37:48] switch paths. And you actually solve the thing that you do the next level. While you're going through this,

[37:52] I think that there's this personal experience that you have to learn the difference between,

[37:56] which is what's good hard and what's bad hard. And this actually ladders up to a very classic

[38:01] entrepreneur question of, do I push or do I pivot? And you're like, wait a second, I thought you said

[38:05] that I shouldn't switch new things. It's different. The good kind of hard is when you have

[38:10] underlying assumptions that you believe to be true from first principles and just have to push

[38:15] through via iteration. That sounded like a bunch of words. So let me just give an example. So if I want

[38:19] to start running TikTok ads for one of our companies because we decide like, you know what,

[38:23] one of the things that the big Harry problem here is that we don't know how to advertise on paid

[38:25] and that's what's that's what it's going to take for us on the mark. Okay, well, if I sell to a

[38:30] accountants, right? I would say, okay, are there accounts in its own TikTok? And the Israel be,

[38:34] yes. And so it's like, okay, well, is there a way that we can run as profitably to get our messaging

[38:38] in front of those people? If the answer is yes, then I fundamentally believe that there's a profitable

[38:41] way to turn their rivals into customers. Period. Now, you might have run a TikTok ad to get

[38:46] accounts and not gotten them, but it doesn't mean that getting the accountants on TikTok is

[38:49] impossible. It's just, you don't know how to do it. Again, solvable. And you might be like, oh, but that's

[38:55] going to be hard. Remember, there's going to be a big dollar sign, a big price tag associated

[39:00] with solving that problem. Let's say if we start running ads and we don't immediately see ROI,

[39:04] that's the good kind of hard because we can iterate. Remember, say, good kind of you iterate, right?

[39:08] Do we get enough clicks? Do we get enough optins? Are they the people who opt in or they're

[39:12] the right to have people? If not, maybe we need to change the message and change the targeting, right?

[39:16] All these are just iterative, but it's not that it's impossible. It takes work. This is iterative hard.

[39:20] That's good hard. To be clear, I don't see losing money on ads is losing money. I see it as investing

[39:24] in something that's going to increase the enterprise value by creating another acquisition channel

[39:28] and simultaneously diversifying how we get customers. And so having multiply acquisition channels

[39:33] meaningfully increases enterprise value without even having additional profit because it decreases

[39:37] the risk for the an acquire as in the person who's going to buy the company. Right? If I have

[39:41] two ways of getting customers, I feel way better. If I had six ways of getting customers, I feel even

[39:45] better than that. But not only that, each of the six ways also brings more customers. So it also grows

[39:48] the business and decreases the risk. It's one of the most valuable things you can do in a business.

[39:52] And so it would make sense that the reason it's such a valuable thing to do in the business

[39:55] is because it's hard. It's hard. It's why most people don't do it. Which is why it is valuable.

[39:59] And it is rare. I can't say that I want this really rare outcome. And then at the same breath, say,

[40:04] I'm not willing to do very rare levels of work. So let's do it. So if a business is worth $10 million.

[40:11] Okay. And I can add a second acquisition channel that doubles the revenue and diversify the risk.

[40:16] That might add $15 million in the price value. So if I lose $100,000, figuring out TikTok ads

[40:22] over six months, but I get a $10 million return on it, would I do it?

[40:28] Absolutely. But the thing is, I say this. And people in other heads are they're listing it.

[40:35] And I'm like, yeah, I believe that. But you have to see these as investments in the business.

[40:42] Like, I'm going to invest this time and this money. And I'm willing to not see success for this

[40:47] period of time before deciding to truly call it. And honestly, the when you decide to truly call it

[40:53] is just your ability to do a pain. So there's something about human behavior around this,

[40:57] which comes down to frustration tolerance. So the basic behavior is how many times you try something

[41:03] again before you quit. And this typically has to do with your history of being reinforced after multiple

[41:08] attempts. So I'll give you a very simple example. If you say, hey, I'm not going to buy something from you.

[41:15] And the salesman says, well, like have you thought about it like this or have you thought about

[41:19] like that. The amount of times that that salesman is willing to follow up and ask again on the call

[41:24] is directly proportional to the amount of times in his past or her past that after asking a second

[41:29] third fourth fifth time, they were rewarded for doing so. And so if someone gets rewarded again,

[41:34] intervener reinforcement doesn't mean they have to get reinforced every time they ask five times,

[41:38] if they get reinforced enough times that they ask five times, they will ask five times every time.

[41:43] So if you have a dog and they come to the table and you give them food because they beg,

[41:49] then what do you do? You reinforce begging. So they come back and they beg. Now, if they come back

[41:53] and then you don't give a term because you execute your well power and they sit there and they

[41:58] you still don't give them food. Fine, what do they do tomorrow? They come back again.

[42:03] And what do you do tomorrow? You don't give a term. What do they do the next day? They come back again?

[42:08] Okay, they come back again. And here's the praise bar. Let's say that, let's say that they come back

[42:12] five, six times. If on the sixth time, you give a term again. You've just taught them

[42:18] that they have to wait for extended periods of time. You have rewarded them trying again and again

[42:23] and again and again. Entrepreneurs, we are like this too. And if you're newer to the game,

[42:28] then I would encourage you to increase your frustration tolerance. I can't manufacture the wind

[42:33] that you're going to have, but this is why I try to make these videos is that the amount of times

[42:38] that it is taking me a hundred iterations to get an ad campaign to work is a lot. And so now,

[42:44] I just have a fundamental belief. I'm like, if we keep working on this, we will make this work.

[42:48] Because down to fundamentals, there are eyeballs here and we can pay to reach them. There's no reason

[42:53] physically why we can't get them to take a click and then ultimately buy our thing. We just

[42:58] aren't good enough. And so we just have to look, are there people who could buy my stuff in this platform?

[43:01] Is there a way to reach them? And can I do this profitably? Yes, great. And we will make money on a long

[43:05] time horizon. And so the only thing we have to do is just not run out of money while we try.

[43:10] That's it. But here's the thing. Let's say that. And I said, I said that this is what this looks like

[43:14] in reality. You make this decision to make this investment because you see the big price tag on the

[43:18] other side. And you say it would be reasonable for me to spend a hundred thousand dollars a million

[43:22] dollars. Whatever the number is for you. And six months to get this thing that's going to double our

[43:27] acquisition. Right? Of course you would make that investment. But the first month you spend a hundred

[43:31] grand and then you don't make money back. People throw their hands up and they're like, oh, it doesn't

[43:34] work for me. Of course it didn't work the first time. This is why you get paid to solve big problems.

[43:39] The types of problems that occur in entrepreneurship is they're all one of a kind. And you're like,

[43:43] wait a second, I thought business behaving patterns. Absolutely. So I think there's this great,

[43:47] you know, like history doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes. It's the same thing in business. Like

[43:53] if I knew every single thing that I was going to do with every business that I started

[43:57] of then it would be instant, right? You'd be instantly instantly bigger. But no, there's similarities.

[44:02] There's patterns that you recognize. Be like, okay, we're going to have to turn on

[44:05] pay to ads. But we've never done this for B to B on TikTok. So we're going to have to learn that

[44:10] little nuance in this setting. Then even if you don't beat a Beyond TikTok, maybe you haven't

[44:15] done B to B at TikTok for accounting, but you did it for for marketing agencies, right? So like,

[44:20] okay, fine, we did that. All right, well, like there's always going to be more nuanced because I

[44:24] can always say cool, you did that a year ago, but what about today? So the idea that you're going

[44:29] to know the solution is is a false belief that will make entrepreneurship significantly harder for you,

[44:36] or at least more painful for you. I said earlier in this little diet tribe that I just went on,

[44:40] there's good kind of hard and there's back on hard. So what's back on hard? Back on hard is when

[44:46] you're underlying assumptions are proven incorrect. So this is the classic push or pivot, right?

[44:50] So if you pivot at several times, but I've pushed a lot more. So you pivot when you're underlying

[44:56] assumptions are proven incorrect, meaning. So let's say, for example, if a report came out saying

[45:00] TikTok had band accounts from the platform, then I would say we don't push on TikTok.

[45:05] The underlying assumption was there are people here that we can reach them probably.

[45:08] Well, the underlying assumption is wrong. That's not true. So at that point, we have to pivot

[45:13] to a different platform or different advertising method. And so I just use this a clear test of

[45:18] when I'm being stubborn versus when I'm being intelligent. And so before making a big investment,

[45:22] I like to identify what I call the need to believe, right? Or the assumptions that I believe

[45:27] to be true are must believe to be true in order for the remainder to follow as desired.

[45:32] Right? So as long as there's assumptions are true, we keep pushing. And if one of those assumptions

[45:36] is proven wrong, with supporting data, then you change. And so fundamentally, that's the

[45:41] ignorant tax we all pay. Is that sometimes you have these assumptions, because you can't know

[45:45] everything, you're not God. Can't know everything. Sometimes you got to find out on your own.

[45:49] And you find out that assumption that I had is not true. And that was kind of like the whole

[45:53] thing this is predicated on. And so then you pivot, you find something else out that is true

[45:57] that you didn't know which you're before and then you make your change. I'd tell the story in my

[46:02] hundred million dollar offers book of good front of mind who had a technology, but so you think,

[46:07] oh, technology, this is something that, you know, obviously it's going to be cutting edge.

[46:12] But what he chose to do was try and turn around and dying industry. So he tried to turn around

[46:17] newspapers. So he said, hey, I'm going to take you into the digital age. And we're going to have

[46:22] an ad product for you that'll take all your print ads and turn them into online ads on your site.

[46:26] And it's just, you know, you can use our software to do it. It's one click whatever it's very with that.

[46:30] You think, okay, that business makes sense. You're going to transition these guys over. It gives

[46:34] them a whole other thing that they can sell. Cool, groovy. Now, what was the problem with the business?

[46:41] What are the need to believe in that business? The need to believe for that

[46:44] newspapers with their inherent business model are going to continue to exist in order for that

[46:49] business to be viable. Now, at the onset, you might get into that business thinking, well, yeah,

[46:53] I'm going to help them convert that makes sense. But if those businesses cease to exist,

[46:57] there is no one left you convert because all of people have just switched their consumption

[47:01] to other platforms. And so in that instance, that's what I consider bad hard. That's like the

[47:08] underlying assumption of this business is no longer true. It's proven incorrect. We thought that

[47:12] they would continue to exist. We could flip them over. They'd generate the same revenues they

[47:15] were before. And so then we'd have this massive market to go after. But in reality, many of them

[47:20] just went out of business. And so there's really no one to go after. The few that did that you could

[47:23] go after continue to shrink over time, not a good market to go after. That is a bad hard.

[47:28] It's the kind of hard that you can't fix in that setting. You have to pivot. He would then have to

[47:33] ask the question, okay, what other businesses could I add? Digital ads, too. And then at that point,

[47:40] you'd have to say, okay, maybe I could take blogs and make ads, make it make a network of blogs. And

[47:45] that's kind of more new-age traffic. And help them either cross-seller across each others. And

[47:50] you know, basically create this network of traffic. Like that would be an interesting business.

[47:54] Again, there'd be need to be leaves around that as well. At that point, you'd have to have a real

[47:57] existential question of like, who do we want to be when we grow up because who we thought we

[48:00] wanted to be ain't going to work out? Then a little subtext here. It's very rare in what I would

[48:06] consider traditional businesses to have a need to believe that's actually not true. If you're an

[48:12] account, you're in one care. You're in your plumbing business. You're, you sell, you know, website

[48:19] design, notwithstanding AI for the time being in robots taking over. Notwithstanding those two things.

[48:26] For the last hour of the year, it's 50, 60, 80 years. Those businesses, more or less, you not being

[48:31] able to scale them, was a U problem. It's fundamentally U didn't know how. That was it. There wasn't

[48:37] anything wrong with the market. There's nothing wrong with HVAC. There's nothing wrong with Plamic

[48:40] other room, Moncare. All those things are going to be to do exist. And so if you were limited in

[48:44] what any kind of business that I would consider a normal business, just know that there's nothing to

[48:48] do with the scalability of your business, it's your ability to scale. That is the problem. Yours.

[48:53] And so at the end of the day, a lot of entrepreneurs get into this for some sort of freedom or

[48:56] some sort of monetary goal or because they want to solve a problem or combination of off-rate. But we

[49:00] fundamentally get paid to solve big Harry problems. And the bigger and heavier the problem,

[49:06] in general, the bigger and heavier the payoff. Paul Graham said this quote on Twitter the other

[49:10] day and I really liked it. He said, if you want to make a million dollars, you must endure a

[49:15] million dollars of pain. I like to consider how much enterprise value I'll get on the other side

[49:19] of this concrete wall that I'm going to bash my head into. If the number is big enough, and I've

[49:23] got a strong enough helmet, I will keep bashing into it so I can get to the other side. And that's

[49:28] who keeps motivating me. So as long as I'm solving the right kinds of problems, the ones where I

[49:32] can reason to first principles that there is a solution and that solution will make money

[49:36] then I keep going. And if I get to the bottom of it and I find out that my underlying assumption is wrong,

[49:41] I have to change and that's just as hard. For the entrepreneurs who are stuck, we're listening

[49:44] this, we're watching this. Identify the business that you're really in. Confront the big Harry

[49:48] problem in front of you. Don't jump shit thinking that some reason the grass is greater or that

[49:53] the woman in the red dress is somehow different and not crazy from the woman that you're married to

[49:57] she just has a different kind of craze and you'll discover that in time. So you might as well be

[50:01] happy with when you got because you know what you need to do to make this person happy and you keep

[50:05] forging and then you decide whether or not you want to push or you want to pivot based on the

[50:09] underlying assumptions. And if you push, focus on making progress and breaking through that wall

[50:15] because the payoff is on the other side and that's what makes entrepreneurship worthwhile. Now this

[50:19] was all very theoretical because you know obviously it applies a lot of different businesses.

[50:24] If you want to see me apply these same concepts of how to actually push through the walls for

[50:28] business to get it to break through to the next level, I have a video here that you're absolutely

[50:32] going to love of me breaking down a real business and helping me scale.

[00:00] In this video, I'm going to walk you through the first five

[00:02] hires that you need to bring on in your company as you are growing.

[00:05] And as a fundamental framework to think through this, you want to think about

[00:09] especially for the first five that they are really just helping you do more.

[00:12] And so think of them as extensions of yourself over time.

[00:14] We're going to transition from that philosophy to really building a team in departments.

[00:18] But each of the five will more or less correspond to being an extension of you

[00:22] and doing the repeated tasks that are time consuming, but do not necessarily add as much value

[00:27] as some of the most strategic pieces of each of the roles.

[00:29] Alright, and so if you don't know, I am my name is Oximozi.

[00:31] I'm an acquisition.com.

[00:32] That's portfolio companies is about 85 million dollars a year.

[00:34] I make these videos because a lot of people broke and I do not want you to be one of them.

[00:37] So let's rock and roll.

[00:39] So the first of these things in terms of the order and sequence that you're going to be hiring

[00:42] demand is going to be in the reverse order of the value that's being delivered and or

[00:46] what you can get in the marketplace in terms of dollars per hour.

[00:49] And so the more valuable the skill, the more will cost.

[00:51] And so you want to replace the skills that cost least amount of money for you, right?

[00:54] Should make sense.

[00:55] And so typically one of the first two hires and this can happen in any order is going to be

[01:00] one person who's going to be more of an administrative help to you because as you start a

[01:04] business especially in the beginning, there's lots of administrative work that needs to be done.

[01:07] It must be done, but it's not necessarily the high value work that's going to be the

[01:10] business for it, but it must be done.

[01:11] And so number one, we'll typically be someone in that type of role.

[01:14] The second hire will typically be somebody in the customer's successor,

[01:18] customer's support role.

[01:19] Alright, and you're still likely going to be heavily involved in the success or delivery of the product

[01:23] service that you have, but this person is going to help take away some of the repeated tasks

[01:27] that you are doing that are not necessarily value additive, but must be done.

[01:31] Alright, so this is like handling returns, talking to customers about repeated tasks,

[01:36] you know, switching out billing stuff.

[01:37] And again, you'll see that there's some crossover between this administrative role and the

[01:41] help with delivery because in the beginning, that's where a lot of your time is going to start

[01:44] occurring.

[01:45] Note that you're still probably marketing, you're still probably selling because that's what you need to do

[01:49] at this point in the game.

[01:51] The third piece will likely be the first salesperson, right?

[01:54] And that's because, and again, this will depend based on how good you are at sales, right?

[01:58] So like if sales is not necessarily your strong suit, then you might take this earlier.

[02:01] If it is a strong suit of yours, you're going to take it a little bit later because your

[02:04] dollars per hour in that role continues to grow.

[02:06] It's, I don't want you to take these as hard and fast rules.

[02:08] These are just general rules of thumb that the corresponding framework that you need to be

[02:12] thinking this there is how much value by making per dollar.

[02:15] And then how much would it cost me to replace that dollar per hour?

[02:18] So it's like if I do not generate a lot of dollars per hour, it doesn't cost a lot of money,

[02:22] then that will be the first day.

[02:23] Now if I'm generating a lot of money and I can replace it for a medium amount of money,

[02:27] then it's like, well, it's the net difference, right?

[02:30] And that's what we're looking at in terms of how we're replacing each of these rules.

[02:33] And so right off the bat, you're going to have some sort of administrative help.

[02:36] Then you're going to have some sort of customer support help.

[02:37] Then you're going to probably hire some sort of sales role.

[02:40] From there, now kind of depends a little bit on the role.

[02:42] You probably have someone who starts assisting you with the promotion or marketing of your business.

[02:47] So this is oftentimes somebody who's doing setting or doing prospecting for you.

[02:51] Or if you generate customer space self content, this is probably somebody who's being a videographer of

[02:55] some sort or helping you create the content in some way.

[02:58] So with the more laborious parts that are not as valuable, that would be kind of that forth looking

[03:03] higher. And again, that can flip with the sales role.

[03:05] So like if for example, your killer salesman, then you might have somebody who's prospecting

[03:09] in doing some of the intro calls for you so that the majority of your time is but just closing

[03:13] which is the higher value task.

[03:14] So hopefully this common theme is working out and making sense to you because it's like the number one

[03:17] question I get or one of among the top questions I get is like what order should I hire people

[03:21] and what I'm starting my business. The next one is, again, all of these roles can be some of

[03:25] these things can be fractional right in the beginning. So you'll probably have some sort of fractional

[03:28] bookkeeper which is really filling the gap for the finance hall. So they're just doing basic level

[03:32] of accounting for you to get. So you just know how much money you're making at that time.

[03:35] They can have you take control of your expenses, et cetera. Over time, that role will probably

[03:39] come in house but much a little bit later. So like before you're at 100,000 dollars a month, you probably

[03:43] don't have a ton that's going on. So just having a fractional bookkeeper is sufficient. Same thing

[03:47] with somebody who's helping you with your taxes, somebody who's helping you with a legal stuff like

[03:51] you'll have a lawyer but it's not going to be in house. And so as you're moving up this value

[03:55] ladder in terms of the value per hour and the cost per hour that you can get this, the process of

[04:00] entrepreneurship if you think from a big picture perspective, it's always just buying back your time

[04:05] so that you can level up the amount of time you're spending on high-level directivities. Now here's

[04:09] a key point. I see this happen all the time. I'll see how entrepreneurs replace all of their time

[04:13] and then they don't do anything with that added time to add more value. And so in that case,

[04:17] your profit margins will go down because you are not continuing to add and do the things that

[04:21] generate the income. Now as you progress each of these roles become more solidified and these people

[04:27] ideally in a perfect world actually can ascend up and then have teams underneath of them. The

[04:32] person who's helping you originally now has a team of people helping them. The administrative

[04:35] person originally you might have to ascend them into a director of operations. Who's really

[04:39] pushing each of the tasks and projects forward, they end up being a mini project manager for you

[04:43] if done properly. The sales person might become a sales director or sales manager who's actually

[04:47] leading and trading a series of sales people. Now I will tell you that a lot of times people have

[04:52] the difficulty of going from an individual contributor at a high level to a manager. It's one of the

[04:56] hardest transitions in business and it's commonly messed up by most people. All right and so one of the

[05:02] things that comes with the experience in entrepreneurship is you recognize the people who have the talent

[05:05] to do the thing that is required later so you can hire those people earlier on. Now you can't take

[05:10] you know a COW all the billion dollar company put them in as your operator one because they probably

[05:14] can probably get forward it and do the problem out that it's in the opportunity at unless you have

[05:17] funding or some sort of vehicle that you can acquire that talent earlier. And so as a final concept

[05:22] that I want to introduce to you is that whenever you were starting a business you are occurring

[05:26] debt and this is something that I know very very convinced of and so you were encouraging lots of

[05:30] types of debt you are occurring life debt you are occurring management debt you are occurring financial

[05:35] debt you're encouraging technological debt. Right so that a technological debt which by the way is

[05:39] probably if you had another next full-time hire it's usually a tech person who's helping you manage

[05:44] the CRM build-out sites and kind of make all the things that you want to have happen or no

[05:47] should be happening the background actually happen in the rural world they're helping manage passwords

[05:51] on Purdue you people in terms of getting them logins all that kind of jazz and so in terms of the

[05:55] death that you're occurring if you don't have a good CRM that's in place you will incur that debt and

[05:59] then you'll have to pay it back with interest later when the company's bigger if you don't have a

[06:02] good bookkeeper in place you'll have your finances will be a mess and as you scale you'll have to

[06:07] fix and pay back that debt later if you have not the best people or the values are not there then

[06:11] you're encouraging management debt which means you'll have cultural debt which means you'll have to

[06:15] pay that back later and so the idea in terms of moving quickly in the game of entrepreneurship is

[06:20] recognizing which debt I want to incur in what order and so I used to poo poo the idea of investors

[06:26] and venture capital and things like that who gave people money to start because I was like that's

[06:30] not a real entrepreneurship and I think as I you know whether it or age in the game I don't see it that way

[06:34] anymore I just see it as just fundamentally in advantages that they're choosing financial debt to

[06:39] incur fewer other debts incur fewer operation debt incur less talent debt management debt CRM debt like

[06:45] you might have to have a bigger CRM that's better for you so that you can scale having to switch platforms

[06:49] which is common but it would cost more money at front so if your good strapped you might not be

[06:52] willing or able to do that but if you have funding or you have money that you're willing to invest in the

[06:56] business upfront then sometimes you can do that and so one of the things that is difficult with

[07:00] people who go a bigger company's faster is that they skip through the earlier stages because they

[07:04] know how to do it and so it's the reason that each of the companies that we've had some

[07:08] is going to have grown bigger faster stronger than the companies that preceded them because we are

[07:12] willing to incur less of the other types of debt rather than financial debt because we have the

[07:16] finance and so we can skip steps in the growth process that would normally offer out a quarter's

[07:21] worth of growth by implementing a new CRM more offload a quarter you know or set me back another quarter

[07:26] because I have to fix my financials or set me back another year because I have a whole

[07:29] much of management team in place for inexperienced and I need to get more bid there done that

[07:33] on the team and few are all learned as I go and so as we're thinking through this and you're hiring

[07:37] your team the two major frameworks that I'd like you to take away with this is number one you're hiring the

[07:41] reverse order of value that you are providing and cost to the marketplace that you can use to replace it

[07:47] and so typically you will one gets customer support to some sort of administrative role three

[07:52] some sort of sales or a set of role four some sort of marketing assist five some sort of fraction

[07:56] of bookkeeper and or a sixth which would be your IT person or tech person that is usually the

[08:01] beginning of the core team and then it Christmas trees down so each of them right now have five

[08:06] people hanging off of them let me see you as this that does freeze there we go you'll have five

[08:09] people hanging off of each of these not necessarily five IT people but hopefully you can understand

[08:13] especially on the marketing the sales and on the delivery those are the teams that tend to grow

[08:17] as the companies grow and the you know IT and finance departments and HR departments what

[08:22] which end up getting built over time there's a ratio that is a higher ratio as in you need fewer

[08:27] of them per amount of customers or employees that you have in the company and so as you scale that

[08:31] is for number one and then for number two is be mindful of the type of debt that you are incurring

[08:35] and make sure it is the type of debt that you would prefer to incur if you have the choice and so

[08:40] if you are new to the channel welcome to most of the nation and enjoy the next video bye

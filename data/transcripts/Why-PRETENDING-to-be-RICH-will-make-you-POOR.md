[00:00] Hi, Alex.

[00:01] I have a businessman tour who is telling me that I should fake it until I make it.

[00:07] It sounds contrary to what you say in your YouTube channel and I don't know who to trust.

[00:12] And so I wanted to hear your explanation for why you don't believe in that concept.

[00:20] What's up, everybody?

[00:21] Mozzy Nation, Rockin' and Rollin'.

[00:23] My name's Alex Shemozi.

[00:24] If you're new to the channel and we have a portfolio of companies that is about $85 million a year.

[00:29] All right, I make this channel because a lot of people are broken.

[00:30] I don't want you to be one of them.

[00:31] So walk in with Mozzy Nation.

[00:32] All right.

[00:33] So to hit on this question, right?

[00:35] Should I fake it until I make it?

[00:37] This is something that is really close to home for me because I, it drives me absolutely

[00:41] bonkers.

[00:42] And so I'll tell you quick story.

[00:44] And then we can go from there to illustrate the point.

[00:47] So this is probably five years ago, maybe six years ago, somewhere in there.

[00:51] I was showing up to our first event of our licensees.

[00:54] All right, so we only had 20 licensees at the time.

[00:56] And this is the first event.

[00:57] All right.

[00:58] If you're curious why I have a mustache, this story will explain it to you.

[01:01] So I was so nervous the night before that I, for the two-day event that we were going

[01:05] to have to provide value and all that kind of stuff, that I had this big beard.

[01:09] And so I shaved it off and I was doing Wolverine, the mutton chops, the gun slinger.

[01:13] And then all the way, I left down to a porn stash.

[01:16] And I look outside the bathroom and I looked at Leila and I was like, hey, baby.

[01:20] And she cracked up and she was like, please don't do that.

[01:22] I look back at the mirror and I cracked up and I was like, you know what?

[01:25] I'm doing it.

[01:26] I'm rocking the stash.

[01:27] So nervous and so stressed about this data moral that I wanted to give myself a reason

[01:31] to not, just not take myself so seriously, right?

[01:34] And so I was like, you know what?

[01:35] Worst case scenario, I'm going to die and no one's going to remember who I am anyways.

[01:38] So anyways, I show up the next day and I pull up right as we're pulling up to the

[01:42] hotel to where the event is, right?

[01:44] And we're pulling up in a pre-ass that has a dent in the side and a crack in the windshield.

[01:49] And one of licensees comes up to me and she says, and she's walking at the same time

[01:54] and sees that.

[01:55] And walks over and she says, hey, I thought you were supposed to be rich.

[02:02] And you can imagine the terror, right?

[02:03] Because this is the, you know, I'm posthocend and then I'm dealing with the night before, right?

[02:06] Now my job, this point I already had six gems with sold them and then I'd already had

[02:10] 30 plus turn rounds, right?

[02:11] So like, I was very good at the thing that we're talking about, right?

[02:14] But I still have this, I still remember the shock.

[02:17] But what I said next is the reason that I have always been transparent with my numbers

[02:21] when we do well when we not do well in terms of how we do our lifestyle, et cetera.

[02:26] And so at the time, I was a cash millionaire.

[02:29] So a million dollars in my bank account, right?

[02:31] And I hadn't even started investing stuff yet.

[02:32] So I've side note, I think making sure you have the right sequence is important.

[02:35] But a million dollars saved up in my bank account after taxes at this moment.

[02:39] And when she said this, I just remember thinking, I was like, oh my God, am I a fraud?

[02:44] And then the reality of my situation, not the thickness of my situation, was what came

[02:49] forth to hold me strong in that moment.

[02:52] And I said, you should see my bank account, not my car.

[02:56] And I was like, I was like, you want to be rich, not look rich, right?

[02:59] She was like, yeah, and I was like, well, that's what I'm here to show you how to do.

[03:02] And then the rest event was awesome.

[03:04] And then all the people, two weeks later, all the due to stashes without me saying anything.

[03:09] So I think they liked it.

[03:10] And then that is what gave birth to the stash, which has still been pervasive in many of the

[03:15] marketing things that we've done.

[03:16] All right.

[03:16] But here's the reason that I'm actually against the fake it to you, make it.

[03:20] The first is that you, in the mirror at night, know that you're a fraud.

[03:23] I mean, and that's the biggest thing.

[03:24] At the end of the day, if you've heard anything that I've ever talked about is that you

[03:27] have to have conviction in what you sell, right?

[03:29] And the thing at the very most that you are selling is you are selling yourself to yourself.

[03:34] And if you were lying to everyone else about how successful you are, then you're achieving

[03:41] yourself.

[03:42] And that kind of integrity is very hard to recapture, because the hardest persons respect

[03:47] to earn is your own, in my opinion.

[03:50] Most of you have your own respect, everyone else's respect comes pretty easily because they

[03:53] know that you respect you.

[03:54] And so I know this is deep stuff, but like at the end of the day, like entrepreneurship

[03:57] is a journey of beliefs, right?

[03:59] It's a journey about building your character and about acquiring skills.

[04:03] And the businesses are only a reflection or a manifestation of the internal changes that

[04:08] we've had or experiences entrepreneurs, which why I think entrepreneurship is the single greatest

[04:12] personal development path you can possibly go on.

[04:14] Here's some other reasons why I think this is stupid.

[04:15] And mind you, at the time when I had a million dollars in my bank account, lay on

[04:18] I were living together on $1,200 a month of rent in about $400 ish a month in food.

[04:24] So 100 bucks a week in food, $1,200 a month in rent.

[04:27] And that's what we were living on.

[04:28] And we were taking home at the time, three or four hundred thousand ones a month.

[04:32] So just for context, I've never had a really expensive watch, the only really expensive

[04:37] thing that I've purchased that was a waste was a Bentley, which I actually already sold

[04:41] in Gateway.

[04:42] I should have come up with some sexy YouTube headline for that.

[04:44] But we just gave it back, because I didn't need it and I didn't want it and felt like

[04:47] a waste and it felt contrary to who I am and what I believe it.

[04:50] But the end of the day, if you decide what your values are first and you live your life

[04:54] in accordance with those values rather than what you think the world wants you to do,

[04:58] then you will be able to stand steadfast and strong in the face of adversity with full

[05:02] knowledge of who you are.

[05:04] And I think that the strength of that cannot be understated.

[05:07] I've said this quote many times in our communities and on this channel, which is, you

[05:10] must outwork yourself down.

[05:12] If you feel like you're not confident, then you must outwork the things that you're

[05:16] insecure about.

[05:17] If you're like man, I'm selling these services and I'm not sure if I'm that good at

[05:20] them.

[05:21] They do more of them and don't pretend.

[05:23] Honesty is one of the most compelling and conflicting things for persuading people.

[05:27] Saying what you are good at and what you are not good at truthfully, when you far more

[05:31] followers and fans and loyal customers and loyal employees, then pretending.

[05:37] Because the end of the day, they can feel that you are just in January because they know

[05:40] that it is hollow.

[05:41] They know that on the inside, you do not believe the words that are coming out of your

[05:44] mouth.

[05:45] That's how people speak without conviction and they cannot sway others because they

[05:48] have not swayed themselves because they have lost their own respect.

[05:52] And so I am not the believer in buying the Ferrari when you can't afford it.

[05:55] I am not the believer in affording the home and paying for the home that you cannot afford

[06:00] because you want to pretend like this is the lifestyle that you want to be around.

[06:04] If you go into the guys of networking, you can still go to those places without buying

[06:08] a $4 million house when you're barely making a few hundred thousand dollars.

[06:11] It doesn't make sense.

[06:12] I like Jay's use quarter around this which is if you can't buy something twice, don't

[06:16] buy it once.

[06:18] I really like that.

[06:19] And so this is one of the most common questions I get for new launch printers because

[06:23] they think that they have to, they have to, they have to pose on Instagram in order to get

[06:29] to get wealthy.

[06:30] And what it does is it can flate sequence.

[06:32] Jeff Bases is famous because of what he did not because he became famous as Jeff Bases and

[06:36] then used his following to build something.

[06:38] Elon Musk is famous for what he is accomplished, not for being Elon Musk and then creating

[06:42] something as a result.

[06:44] Let the actions be the thing that gives you the fame rather than yourself.

[06:47] At least that is Alex's two cents in my viewpoint in the world and I think most of

[06:51] the most of the nation you guys share that belief with me.

[06:54] And for those of you who are new to this channel, you're going to get more of this type

[06:57] of stuff and none of the fake until you make it nonsense.

[07:01] That is a sure way to be broke.

[07:03] And I will tell you this as a last thing.

[07:06] The amount of people who in 2008 when everything crashed, who were faking it until they

[07:12] put made it, just faked it until they lost it all because they lost what little amount

[07:18] that they had because they were so overextended.

[07:21] But I can tell you that just about everyone can become wealthy if you choose to live

[07:25] on lower, unless then you make.

[07:28] And that is a ratio.

[07:30] Well, if there's a ratio, not a number.

[07:32] And so any who, if you are having struggles with this question, I would posit, I would

[07:39] beg of you that you build your own respect first.

[07:43] That you're honest with yourself first.

[07:45] And if you always maintain the integrity of, hey, last year we got smashed, right?

[07:50] This year we'll do a little bit better.

[07:52] And two years from now, when you do even better than that, you can be truthful and people will

[07:55] believe you.

[07:56] But if you always are telling a story about how you're always doing so well, hey, everyone

[08:01] will hate you.

[08:02] Be known, cares.

[08:03] And see you will know that you are full of it.

[08:06] And at the end of the day, I think that is the only thing that we're going to keep with

[08:09] us.

[08:10] And when we die, everyone's going to forget about us anyways.

[08:12] See, might as well at least enjoy your self while you're alive.

[08:14] So, no, it's keeping awesome, mosaic shift.

[08:15] You enjoy the steps, subscribe.

[08:16] You didn't lots of love you the way, keeping awesome.

[08:18] I'll catch you in next videos.

[08:19] Bye!

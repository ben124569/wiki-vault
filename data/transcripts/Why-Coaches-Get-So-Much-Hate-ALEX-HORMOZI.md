[00:00] people who had mentors and coaches experience four times greater success than the exact same person

[00:08] doing it on their own. It is something that is highly debated, oddly, and you see, you know,

[00:16] internet gurus, you see coaches all over the place, right? And the reason I wanted to talk about this

[00:23] is, I think it's a super important topic for a variety of reasons. One is why, you know,

[00:29] why is it important, but secondly, why do coaches get so much hate, right? And so I wanted to

[00:34] tell you what the data says with the science says. And so I was having a conversational doctor

[00:39] Kashi who somebody you guys know is a very close friend of mine. And he was saying that he had just

[00:44] seen a paper that was a mega meta-analysis of the impact of coaching and mentorship on success,

[00:51] right, on how people are doing, right? And they found over 40,000 research studies and when they

[01:01] consolidated all of the information and they controlled for income and, you know, IQ and all of the

[01:07] different things that could make one person do better than another, people who had mentors and coaches

[01:14] experienced four times greater success than the exact same person doing it on their own, all right?

[01:22] And to me, that seems like the most no-brainer reason, I mean, why would you, I mean, who wouldn't

[01:27] want to have four times greater success or four times faster results by having that, right? And

[01:35] the thing is, despite knowing that, and despite knowing that every professional athlete,

[01:38] every Olympian and every major team has coaches for some reason, the general population or

[01:45] people at large still have so much hate for them, right? And you can, if you've ever had any kind of

[01:49] coach, you can probably think back and think like, yes, I was coaching with this person and then

[01:54] many, many times people have a native impression of that person who they worked with, all right?

[02:00] And so I like to dive into these types of things because, I see like huge generalities, you know,

[02:04] sweeping across the board, and I and by no means immune to this, I have tons of people that I've

[02:09] helped, you know, go from broke to $1,000 plus Jim that now absolutely speedy-endsmit.

[02:15] And I just like to think like, what cost us, right? And so I was reading, I think it's 50 scientific

[02:23] ways, which is a phenomenal book, right? I've 50 scientific ways to persuade people or to get the

[02:27] guess, come on, read something like that. It's one of Robert Kieldini, who is the author of

[02:32] Influencent Pre-Solution, which we're both doing the best books on influence and marketing

[02:36] and sales that exist. So he's co-author of this book and one of the chapters highlighted

[02:42] something that I thought was like a huge eye opener for me. And it was that when doing a favor for

[02:48] someone, all right? And I'll show you how this relates to coach. When doing a favor for someone,

[02:53] the perception of the favor in how important and how big it was,

[02:58] actually correlate with time. And so immediately after you do a favor for someone,

[03:05] the person who received the favor thinks super high-level because they were just in pain and

[03:11] they're immediately relieved from the pain they were in. And then at that moment, it's when they

[03:15] believe what you did for them to be of the the highest importance of the, of the highest impact on their life.

[03:21] Then over time, it just continues to decline, right? Over time, over time it continues to go down

[03:28] of what their perception of what your favor was and what it did for their lives.

[03:34] Now where this is gets interesting, is that the perception of the favor doer of you, right?

[03:41] If you did the favor, you believe that the amount of effort and the amount of impact it had on

[03:45] the person's life goes up over time. And so immediately after you do something for someone,

[03:51] is the moment you feel like it was nothing, it wasn't a big deal, I just, you know, I just did this

[03:56] in this. But the person who received it was like, oh my god, this was like I was stuck in this for two

[04:00] years and it was horrible when it soon as you came in, everything changed, right? But if you revisit

[04:05] that same story, six months later, the person who got the favor is like, I mean, I would have

[04:11] figured it out anyways, you know, I'm a pretty, pretty smart guy, I really wanted to do it.

[04:15] If it wasn't that guy with someone else, I was going to figure it out, right? It wasn't that big of a deal.

[04:20] And then the person who did the favor is like, oh my god, I saved this guy's life and he just

[04:25] need to even pop up on the block, right? Whatever. But the point is that this is a psychological bias

[04:32] and it's just real, it's just in people. And so in recognizing that, it can give you a little bit

[04:37] for me, I've saw this because I'm just like, okay, you know, what's going on here? But it's just,

[04:42] it's a, it's a scientifically proven psychological bias that exists in all humans. And so I think that

[04:47] there's a couple of takeaways that I've taken from this and that you can't, too. Is that one

[04:55] if you, if you're doing any kind of coaching, right, it could be finished coaching, it could be,

[04:59] you know, it could be you're being a doc and I'm using coaching in a broad term, it could be mentorship,

[05:03] it could be, you know what I mean? It doesn't have to be business related, it could be anything,

[05:07] right? Is that if you, so this is purely just me getting the taxes quite this, if you do someone

[05:14] a favor, the time to ask for a favor in return is immediately, immediately after you've done the favor.

[05:21] Because at that point, is where they will believe what you did for them was of the most important,

[05:27] right? Now you can also get into probably secondary effects at this, which is,

[05:31] well, if you can continue to do favors over time, right? Then you continue to have those,

[05:36] those windows of goodwill, right? And I think of it like a telephone telephone wire. So if you

[05:42] guys enter old school, I don't even know what to, of course it's things, something called

[05:45] telephone or parlance, where, you know, there's a pull and then it dips down and then there's another

[05:49] pull and then it dips down and then it's another pull. And just think of each of those pulls as

[05:53] the goodwill or the, or the things that you do to help people out. But if you don't do that,

[05:58] then it just continues to go down and the texture's thick down and then it, you know, the wire blows up

[06:02] because of whatever, right? And so, um, I just find this really interesting because

[06:08] favors, I think, also act a lot like information, right? And if you sell information, like I do,

[06:15] right, I sell business, my wife sells sales training, I sell, you know, how to, how to, how to

[06:18] generate customers, all like that stuff, right? Is that information, although incredibly valuable,

[06:25] upon consumption immediately decreases in value and perceived value to the person who consume it.

[06:31] And so, information is one of those interesting things that is incredibly value, but declines in

[06:36] value very rapidly, all right? And so, this is why, if you are teaching people things, you need to

[06:43] consistently teach new things on a regular basis so that they can continue to have those telephone

[06:50] over and over again, you break a belief or teaching a new thing or whatever it is so that they

[06:54] can continue to grow. And I do think that over time there's some level of goodwill that gets built,

[06:59] but still most people are function on the what have you done for me lately, right? And I just,

[07:04] you can, you can be resentful of that and you can be the favorite doer who's like,

[07:07] I changed this guy's life. Or you can just deal with the reality is that people don't care,

[07:12] right? They'll just think about what you did for them lately. And so, I just see this as in

[07:17] credit like as statements of truth. And so, then you can just act in accordance with that.

[07:22] It's like so, if you, if you want, you know, you help some loose 25 pounds working with you,

[07:27] then get the testimonial at that time, write it that moment, right? Don't wait and then ask for

[07:33] six months later because at this point, they're going to be like, well, I was going to join another

[07:36] gem. You know, I was going to probably do something either way and it was really me doing all the

[07:40] dieting. I mean, yeah, you know, he helped, right? Whereas, if you've done it right after they get

[07:45] off the scale and you tell them to come right in and then you do a great video, they'll have all the

[07:49] emotions, they'll just have gotten out of pain, they'll have achieved their, their thing and

[07:52] things is they'll probably far more accurately depict how much of a change you really did in their

[07:58] lives, right? And so, I think this has far reaching implications for a the psychology of the coach,

[08:06] but also be the psychology of the coach he, right? And I think that I've experienced this myself with

[08:12] different coaches that I've had throughout my life, recognizing myself internally is like, you know,

[08:17] I look back on what they did and I think those same thoughts, which is like, I would have done it anyway,

[08:22] I'm a winner winners win and I was going to happen. Now whether or not that's true, it doesn't

[08:26] really matter. The point is is that they were still the one who helped me out, right? And so, you know,

[08:30] giving respect to those people, I think it's been something that in the beginning of my career,

[08:35] I don't think I did as much as I do now and I think it's partially just, you know, maybe it's

[08:40] age, maybe it's experience, maybe it's scar tissue, you know, whatever it is, but I have, I think I have

[08:47] probably in the last year or two, been much better about giving massive amounts of respect to the

[08:54] people who helped me out earlier on in my life. And let me give you a different framing as well

[09:00] if you're the person who got received the favor. So I kind of talked about this from the coaching

[09:04] perspective, but talk about it from the student perspective is that like in my book, which was

[09:09] released two years ago, you're going to have to go whatever it is. I've acknowledged my

[09:13] thoughts in the back and I have all people who influenced me on that page, good and bad,

[09:19] because I still learned tremendous amounts from some of the people who were what I would consider

[09:23] maybe negative mentors, right? I learned what not to do a lot of times. And still,

[09:30] some of those people still broke beliefs of mine even if they weren't intending to, right? And so,

[09:35] I think Tony Robbins talked about this, where he says, you know, blame them, you can't just

[09:39] blame your mom or your dad, right, for the insecurities they gave you. Also, blame them for your

[09:46] resilience, blame them for your ability to persevere, blame them for all the positive characteristics

[09:53] that you developed as a result or in reaction to some of the negative things that they did.

[09:57] Right? And so I think that if you can adopt that perspective, it's one way mentally healthier for

[10:02] you, too. You won't burn bridges with people who probably did help you at some point. And then

[10:07] three, if you are the coach, if you recognize that this is going to be a cognitive bias,

[10:12] this is going to be a psychological bias that's innate in all humans, then you can adjust the way

[10:16] that you fulfill your business or you fulfill your coaching, which is one, if you want to get someone

[10:22] to recognize what you did for them, you want to have that immediately or soon after they achieve

[10:26] their result, right? And then, secondly, you want to continue to post up those telephone polls.

[10:32] We get after week, month after month, so that you don't have to have that information to

[10:36] climb over time. And the only way to do that is work, right? Is a requires effort. Like we have

[10:43] to continue to innovate, we have to continue to make things easier, we have to continue to strive

[10:48] to solve the next problem because the good news for everyone is that every single student you

[10:52] ever have, as soon as you solve a problem, a new problem will be created from the gap that you just

[10:59] that you just bridged, right? They will just go across the bridge to the next plateau, where there's

[11:04] another gap where they need another bridge build. And so as long as you've been far that far ahead

[11:08] enough of the people that you are teaching coaching, mentoring, student team, right? You will be able

[11:14] to continue to build bridge after bridge after bridge for this people and it will force you to grow

[11:19] as a coach, as an entrepreneur, as a business owner, as whatever, right? Because you will force

[11:25] to level yourself up so that you can continue to provide value because the value that you provided

[11:31] has an expression to it. So, I hope you've done that valuable. Hopefully that that interesting

[11:35] for me, I think it was really what's I kind of connected with this piece together. It made a lot

[11:39] of sense in my new life for me as a student, but also for what I've experienced as a coach or mentor,

[11:46] or I hate the word mentor, but whatever. As somebody who develops business models,

[11:52] and helps other people make more profitable businesses, it's been something that's been very

[11:56] valuable for me and honestly just very calming to my experience. And so anyways, I hope that makes

[12:01] sense to you. Hope you've done that valuable. And if you did tag coach, tag one of your coaches,

[12:05] tag some of your trainers, tag some of your friends, family, dogs, pet, prepower, whatever it is.

[12:11] Otherwise, have an amazing day. Hope you guys have a crushing Tuesday and I'll talk to you guys on

[12:15] flipside.

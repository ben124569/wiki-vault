[00:00] Five business lessons that I just learned

[00:02] crossing 250 million in 2024.

[00:04] So the first one was the cost of change.

[00:07] It was the first time that I've actually quantified,

[00:09] how much is changing something in the business actually cost?

[00:12] So if you would imagine a straight line, right?

[00:15] It's saying, okay, this is normal business activity,

[00:18] right, straight line is going across.

[00:20] Now let's imagine we want to change something, right?

[00:22] So that's like our normal revenue,

[00:24] but then we decide, you know what,

[00:25] I'm going to change something in the business.

[00:27] So what ends up happening is this little line

[00:29] and kind of dips down.

[00:30] And I've estimated just for my kind of like this again,

[00:33] there's no science behind this, just my estimate.

[00:35] Then I get about a 20% decrease in effectiveness

[00:38] across any function that I'm going to change,

[00:41] especially with its manual.

[00:42] Now if you split us ahead of line that's different,

[00:44] but if you're like, hey, we're changing our onboarding process

[00:46] or we're changing our sales process or changing our outbound

[00:48] process or we're changing our something

[00:50] that people are involved with,

[00:52] we tend to get a decrease immediately of 20% in a performance,

[00:56] all right, which is pretty significant.

[00:58] And so as soon as I realized that we had almost

[01:00] this guaranteed cost of change,

[01:02] which is about 20%, I was able to quantify

[01:05] what things were worth doing.

[01:07] Because if you're anything like me,

[01:08] I have like this big list of stuff where I'm like,

[01:10] man, we should need to improve this, we need to improve this.

[01:12] And I've all these ideas of things that I think

[01:14] that don't improve it.

[01:15] But when I actually am honest with myself

[01:17] and I think, huh, how much is number one

[01:19] going to actually improve the business?

[01:21] If I say, well, I think I've maybe get a 5% improvement.

[01:24] Well, if I have a guaranteed 20% decrease

[01:27] or decrement and performance, and I have a 5% incremental

[01:31] increase in performance, do I want to take a 20% guaranteed loss

[01:35] to have a potential for a 5% gain?

[01:38] Probably not.

[01:40] And so what's ended up happening is that there's all these

[01:42] little 5% 5% little improvements that I think could happen.

[01:47] But there's only like one or two, 20, 30, 50%

[01:51] plus improvements I think we can do in the business.

[01:53] And so what happens is some of these things

[01:55] I just choose to never do.

[01:57] And I'll try not to take explicit here.

[01:59] But some states, you just have to accept

[02:02] that the business will not be perfect,

[02:04] but your chase of perfection will actually

[02:05] make your current business worse

[02:07] because you're constantly changing things.

[02:08] But let me spell this out one more level.

[02:10] So let's say you have your 20% loss, right?

[02:13] Now let's say you do something that is good, right?

[02:15] And it's, you know, you start going up, right?

[02:17] 20% loss, it starts going back up.

[02:19] But what happens if you, at the same time, say,

[02:22] oh, well, now I'm going to start changing something else, right?

[02:25] And so basically you incur this permanent 20% decrease

[02:29] because you're always changing something.

[02:31] So you're always 20% below where you should be in the business.

[02:33] 20% is a lot.

[02:34] Oftentimes in the business, my business is going to

[02:37] exceptionally well when I just let them breathe.

[02:39] Because here's the other part that no one tells you.

[02:41] If you change nothing, you get about a 5% guaranteed

[02:45] improvement.

[02:46] Think about crazy that is.

[02:47] If you change nothing, you just,

[02:49] pup, pup, pup, pup, five percent.

[02:51] You can book it.

[02:53] Think about GDP, partially something we're like,

[02:55] well, that must be, you know, that could be in relation to education,

[02:58] which in the US it certainly isn't.

[02:59] It could be in relation to technology in terms of GDP improvement,

[03:02] or it could be an increase because of population,

[03:04] which in the US there's no population increase,

[03:05] but not really.

[03:06] For me, I just kind of see that across all businesses

[03:08] that if you just let people do stuff,

[03:10] they just get better at it, right?

[03:11] People get more efficient at it.

[03:12] I'll leave you one tactical framework

[03:14] that you can kind of use to think through this,

[03:16] which is this is actually from the investing world

[03:18] that I borrowed as an entrepreneur,

[03:19] which is called ICE.

[03:21] All right?

[03:21] And so it's an acronym, I stands for Impact,

[03:24] which is like, how big?

[03:25] That's that 20 percent, that's that 50 percent.

[03:27] How big of an impact do I think this is gonna make on the business?

[03:30] If I had to make, like, if this works, it's gonna do this.

[03:33] The second is, well, how confident am I

[03:35] that it's going to work?

[03:36] That's the C, which is, what's my confidence level?

[03:40] So I got this big thing with low confidence,

[03:42] or this medium thing with high confidence,

[03:44] I'll probably take medium with high confidence, right?

[03:46] And then the third is E's,

[03:48] which is gonna come into a combination of,

[03:50] how many resources are we gonna have to deploy to do this?

[03:52] And also what's the timeline?

[03:54] They're gonna have to do this on.

[03:55] Impact, confidence, E's.

[03:57] And so we'd actually do this.

[03:58] Like, I have this massive sheet that it's called growth.

[04:01] And I have it in all caps, and this is how I,

[04:05] like, how I get my ADD out,

[04:07] is I put it all in this list,

[04:08] which would probably be the second big tactic,

[04:10] is that I have every big idea that I wanna try,

[04:13] and I have to like, get it out and spell it out

[04:15] and say all the things that I wanna do,

[04:16] and I just put it somewhere,

[04:18] because the team can't handle the amount of ideas that I have,

[04:20] and probably your team can't either.

[04:22] You have to just like scratch that itch in some way.

[04:24] I do it by documenting, so I don't forget it.

[04:26] And then whenever the team has more pin,

[04:28] with I go back to that list, and I'm like,

[04:30] all right, let's order this,

[04:31] which one has the highest impact,

[04:33] which one do we think's gonna work,

[04:34] which one's gonna be the easiest?

[04:35] We tabulate those together, and we're like, okay,

[04:38] this is the one that we're gonna try.

[04:39] This one we know has a 30% shot,

[04:42] or a 50% chance increase.

[04:44] That's basically thing number one,

[04:46] and it has, I've tried to teach this down our portfolio,

[04:48] and also what we do at Acquisitor.com,

[04:50] is that you just need to be willing

[04:53] to leave some things not perfect,

[04:56] so that the business can occur as few guarantee cost of change,

[05:00] and when you are gonna make a change,

[05:02] make sure it's worth it.

[05:03] So so far, number one, we cover the cost of change, right?

[05:06] So this is making sure that you are only taking bets,

[05:10] that have 20% or higher,

[05:14] upside to be worth the guarantee cost that you're going to incur.

[05:18] And the framework that I use

[05:19] is ice impact confidges, all right, so number one.

[05:22] So the second thing is,

[05:23] I used to have this idea about the viability of products,

[05:26] so I've talked a lot about referrals,

[05:27] I've talked a lot about word of mouth,

[05:28] and I've still obviously believe in it.

[05:31] But I would say that I've had this big pendulum swing

[05:33] in the very beginning of my career,

[05:35] and especially if you're 7 million, you just gotta promote, right?

[05:38] You just gotta let people know about your stuff,

[05:39] no nose you exist, you gotta advertise, right?

[05:41] You gotta learn how to sell.

[05:42] Cool, that's zero to a million, no questions asked,

[05:44] that's what it is.

[05:45] Now to expand beyond that, I was like,

[05:47] okay, we kind of pendulum swinging back

[05:49] to like we gotta make it super viral, right?

[05:51] Word of mouth is the best way to grow a business.

[05:54] But I thought more and more about this,

[05:56] and I think that it's an it depends answer.

[05:59] Now there are some products that you want

[06:02] for sure to have people who buy and then buy again,

[06:04] that you want them to re-occur with you,

[06:07] as a like a viability of cool products,

[06:09] I might buy, you know, a can today,

[06:10] and I might buy a can in a restaurant later this week,

[06:13] and so it's like, am I on a subscription?

[06:14] No, but I buy again and again and again, right?

[06:16] Or you have, you know, your internet

[06:18] which you just never cancel out of, right?

[06:19] Either of those were things that are recurring,

[06:21] they have high revenue retention.

[06:23] But that is different than viability, right?

[06:26] That's very different.

[06:27] So on one level, you have does it stick.

[06:30] On the other level, you have do people share it

[06:32] with other people.

[06:33] This is the nuance of understanding

[06:34] that's kind of shift for me this year,

[06:36] which is that some companies, like,

[06:38] especially B2B,

[06:40] there's sometimes decent incentives for a customer

[06:43] to bring in a competitor of theirs, right?

[06:45] If you service two types of similar businesses,

[06:48] they have literally a decent incentive

[06:49] to tell people about it.

[06:50] Like they don't want anyone to know

[06:51] how you're helping them in whatever way, right?

[06:53] So that's kind of like thing number one.

[06:56] You have like a negative pressure on a word of mouth.

[06:58] The second issue is that not even if you didn't have

[07:01] negative pressure on a mouth,

[07:03] there has to be some sort of density

[07:04] in terms of the frequency of communication

[07:07] that your customers have with other potential customers.

[07:11] So if I've got a guy who runs a metal shop

[07:14] that specializes in arrow tech, for that guy to have

[07:17] very frequent communication with other arrow tech companies

[07:20] that might use my software, my internal tech

[07:23] or whatever it is that I help them with,

[07:25] why is he gonna be talking to competitors?

[07:26] And if he is talking to competitors,

[07:28] like, why would he want to share all my stuff?

[07:29] You can understand why sometimes it's not about word of mouth.

[07:32] This is just a nuance of understanding

[07:33] that I would think it's kind of my belief

[07:35] that is broken because I was very hardcore

[07:37] like everything can grow on a word of mouth period.

[07:40] But that's just not always the case.

[07:42] The gold standard should absolutely be revenue retention.

[07:45] Bar none, full stop, and I can say that with absolute confidence

[07:48] no matter what business you're in for B2B,

[07:50] you're B2C, you wanna be able to get recurring

[07:52] or reoccurring revenue.

[07:54] But the viability, typically is gonna be more

[07:57] on the consumer side.

[07:58] So if you have really good soda,

[08:00] you as a customer is not like,

[08:01] oh, I don't wanna tell my friend that the soda is really good.

[08:04] You know, I've got this shirt, it finally fits me.

[08:05] Cool, well, do I know other guys

[08:07] who are built more like me, yes,

[08:08] do I have high frequency communication with them?

[08:10] At least digitally, yes, okay, cool.

[08:12] So I'm gonna have, there's some viral kind of coefficient

[08:14] that goes in.

[08:15] And that applies to also consumer brands

[08:17] that are not tech.

[08:18] I wanna be really clear about that.

[08:19] Like for those of you who have the dropshipping,

[08:21] e-commerce, retail products, it's like,

[08:23] you still absolutely need to have

[08:24] a word of mouth that grows the business.

[08:26] There are just some businesses

[08:27] that are just never going to have that

[08:29] and for everybody you wanna retain.

[08:31] So that was lesson number two.

[08:33] From a tactical perspective for that,

[08:34] lesson, the big thing I would just wanna measure

[08:36] is what percentage of customers that I have

[08:38] at the beginning of this year

[08:40] that 12 months later are still buying for me.

[08:42] That's the metric that we look at.

[08:44] We have a hundred customers at the beginning of the year.

[08:46] And at the end of the year, 50 of those people

[08:48] are still buying.

[08:49] So this is, you know, days of your yard, you know,

[08:51] Jan won, whatever.

[08:52] Jan won.

[08:54] And then December 31.

[08:56] How many of them are still buying?

[08:57] If I have 50 versus the hundred, then I have 50% revenue retention.

[09:02] Now, you can have logo retention,

[09:03] which is a second nuance of this.

[09:05] Logo retention is of the hundred customers

[09:08] do I have 50 customers or did I go from

[09:11] a hundred customers to 25 customers,

[09:13] but there's 25 customers really like me

[09:15] and they now spend twice as much.

[09:17] So that's the difference between revenue retention

[09:19] and logo retention.

[09:19] For me, we look at revenue retention

[09:21] because that's what we care about.

[09:22] It's like, okay, if we just know that these 50,

[09:24] now that they're in, are just gonna keep paying

[09:26] and potentially even growing between 50 to 100 next year,

[09:29] this is a monster business.

[09:30] This is what we look at and we obsess over

[09:32] in any business that we invest in.

[09:34] Now, no matter what, you might not have a viral product

[09:36] for word of mouth, but if you want seven different ways

[09:39] that you can generate word of mouth,

[09:40] inside of the hundred million dollar leads book,

[09:42] I've got a whole chapter on referrals

[09:43] and I took out the things that were the actual best ways

[09:46] that I have seen from a tactical perspective.

[09:49] So I say I have six kind of thematic things

[09:51] or like these are things that you can do to your product

[09:53] to prove stick to a perfect innovation,

[09:55] you've proved a number of customers

[09:56] who actually want to stay and continue to pay with you.

[09:58] And then on the other side, I have basically the tactics

[10:02] that I have seen work best for me and our businesses.

[10:05] And so these things that actually drew in referrals.

[10:07] So I have this whole section on one side of referrals,

[10:09] two side of referrals, how to ask for the right times,

[10:12] the time is a huge component of it,

[10:13] how to run referral events,

[10:15] how to have ongoing referral programs

[10:16] on the lockable referral bonuses,

[10:18] seven different tactics that I've used work,

[10:19] inside of the hundred million dollar leads book,

[10:21] you can grab them somewhere on my site or on Amazon.

[10:23] Number two is making sure that the highest priority

[10:26] for the business is going to be revenue retention,

[10:29] not necessarily viability

[10:30] because not all products are meant to be viral.

[10:33] But if you are in a business that is consumer focused

[10:37] or something that doesn't have one a disincentive to share

[10:40] and a high frequency of interactions

[10:43] between your customers with one another,

[10:45] people who have basically high overlaps

[10:47] so they talk to lots of people

[10:48] who could potentially buy a product.

[10:50] If these two things are, you have a high disincentive

[10:52] and you have low frequency,

[10:54] then you're just not going to have viability in the product

[10:55] and you don't have to worry about it.

[10:57] But if you do, then obviously you want to have both.

[10:59] Number three, I've been very obsessed with the concept

[11:02] of LTV to CAC, I've talked about it a lot,

[11:03] which is basically how much does a cost you to customer,

[11:06] versus how much money you get from that customer

[11:09] over the lifespan.

[11:10] Specifically in gross profit, not lifetime revenue.

[11:13] Now the reason I like to always delineate this

[11:15] and I say LTGP, which is a mouthful,

[11:17] is because most of the literature that exist on LTV

[11:20] so lifetime value for a customer,

[11:22] how much they pay you in gross profit over time,

[11:24] is typically if written in the software world

[11:26] and software tends to be virtually 100% gross margins

[11:29] in most businesses.

[11:30] Many businesses look at that literature

[11:32] and then say, oh, well, let me just say,

[11:33] someone stays with me for 10 months, they pay $100 a month,

[11:36] therefore my lifetime value is $1,000.

[11:39] Well, that's only true if you sell information,

[11:41] media, or software, something has zero incremental cost.

[11:44] But a lot of businesses don't have that.

[11:46] If you sell chocolate chip cookies

[11:48] and the cookies cost you $20 for each of those $100

[11:51] shipments, I mean these are expensive cookies,

[11:53] well let's just go with it.

[11:54] So let's cost you $20 for every $100 shipment.

[11:56] Your lifetime value is not $1,000,

[11:59] so we have our $100, right?

[12:02] Times 10 months, that's the revenue.

[12:06] What we're looking at is $80 because we have to take

[12:09] out the 20 and cost times the 10 months,

[12:12] which actually equals $800, which is our real lifetime gross

[12:17] profit, which in the business world sometimes

[12:20] will be people refer to as CLV or LTV,

[12:22] they all more or less mean the same thing,

[12:24] which is how much money you're going to get from the customer.

[12:25] Now, I put this as a frame for the big lesson that I had,

[12:29] which is in the software world, the big rule of thumb

[12:31] is the read of one.

[12:33] That's the big rule of thumb.

[12:35] I actually now have to work with a lot of different businesses

[12:37] and invest in different businesses.

[12:38] I think there's nuance to it, so let me explain.

[12:41] This is actually pretty cool.

[12:43] So there's three components to a business

[12:45] that I think influence that number.

[12:47] So you have the attraction component,

[12:49] which is the advertising, how are we advertising,

[12:51] how are we getting people in,

[12:52] how we letting them know, how are we generating leads,

[12:55] then we have the conversion, whatever your sales motion is,

[12:58] that's sales.

[12:59] And then finally, you've got delivery, right?

[13:01] Or fulfillment, how are we going to get people

[13:03] whatever they choose to pay for, right?

[13:05] So if we have these kind of three functions,

[13:08] the extent to which you need to have high LTV to cac

[13:13] is predicated on how manual each of these processes is.

[13:17] So let me explain.

[13:18] If you have paid ads, which I would consider very high leverage

[13:23] and very like one person could write a gazillion dollars

[13:25] of paid ads, high leverage.

[13:26] Cool.

[13:27] So let's ask number one, if we had a conversion process

[13:30] that's through a checkout page that's automated,

[13:32] then that's going to be something else

[13:33] that's going to give us leverage.

[13:34] Okay?

[13:35] And then third is let's say that we have software

[13:37] as our back end that has unlimited,

[13:39] like we have no supply limitations,

[13:40] there's no logistics limitations

[13:42] and pretty much it just works.

[13:43] If you're in one of those businesses,

[13:45] then you absolutely can be at three to one LTV to cac

[13:49] over long haul.

[13:50] Fine, you can be at one point five to one.

[13:52] I mean, it wouldn't be ideal,

[13:53] but depending on the size and scale,

[13:55] you could still make money doing it.

[13:56] Put $100 in, get one, 50 back to it over and over again.

[13:59] If that's only true for them,

[14:00] what is it for a construction business?

[14:02] What is it for a plumbing company?

[14:04] What is it for any commerce business?

[14:06] The other extreme,

[14:07] and what just paint the extremes

[14:08] that you can kind of understand in the middle.

[14:10] If I had instead of paid ads,

[14:12] I had manual outbound,

[14:16] so outreach or whatever you want to call it,

[14:18] outreach, reaching out to people one-on-one with a team.

[14:20] And then from a conversion process, I've got one-on-one sales.

[14:24] And then from a delivery process,

[14:26] I've got, call it, you know, concierge, one-on-one,

[14:30] or even many to one services,

[14:35] then I'm gonna want an LTV to cac ratio

[14:37] that's gonna reflect that.

[14:39] For me, if I had a business like this,

[14:41] and this is gonna shock some of you,

[14:43] but just bear with me.

[14:44] I'm gonna want this thing to be like 20 to one,

[14:47] more, now some of you guys are like,

[14:49] there's no way, it's impossible.

[14:51] I would say I've made the material,

[14:53] the vast majority of the material off in my life,

[14:55] at 30 to one, or a higher.

[14:59] And I've done it multiple times,

[15:00] and during those periods of time,

[15:01] is when a lot of the basically the wealth

[15:03] that I've accumulated has come in.

[15:05] But in the times in between,

[15:06] instead of trying to scale something that's at,

[15:08] you know, five to one or eight to one,

[15:10] I'm just gonna continue to tinker.

[15:12] I'm gonna stick with my one location,

[15:14] I'm gonna keep working on the model,

[15:15] just keep tinkering with it,

[15:16] until eventually get the economics that we need

[15:18] in order to scale.

[15:19] What if I'm doing paid ads,

[15:21] we do 101 sales, and we sell media, information,

[15:25] or something like that?

[15:25] Then it's like, then you're gonna be somewhere in between.

[15:27] But I have this as my rule of thumb,

[15:29] is that the 3 to 1 only matters at the companies

[15:32] that have 100% scale, 100% leverage across all three

[15:35] components here.

[15:37] If you have manual cost all three,

[15:38] you're gonna be at least one,

[15:40] it'll be at 20 to one,

[15:41] I shoot for 30 plus,

[15:42] a lot of people can't even believe that,

[15:43] fine.

[15:44] So, you know, fit it to whatever your goals are.

[15:47] I really do believe that you can just keep tinkering

[15:49] with the business, keep tinkering the offer,

[15:51] and find a way to get it,

[15:52] so that you can have a huge discrepancy

[15:53] between these two numbers,

[15:54] because that's what allows you to scale.

[15:57] If you want to scale a business that's more manual,

[15:59] which if some of you guys are listening,

[16:00] 78% of business in America are service-based businesses,

[16:03] so there's a price to you.

[16:04] As you go into colder and colder markets,

[16:06] you will convert a small percentage of customers.

[16:08] These are customers who are less likely to purchase from you,

[16:09] but you have a bigger pool of people,

[16:11] so that's kind of the trade-off.

[16:12] But when you go to those colder and colder markets,

[16:14] smaller percentage,

[16:15] convert meaning, it costs you more to get those customers.

[16:17] Basically, you sell more people,

[16:19] you're gonna have more infrastructure

[16:20] that has to get built in the business.

[16:21] So you have layers of management

[16:22] that will start costing you,

[16:23] and not necessarily always be offered there,

[16:25] can be value-added.

[16:26] With these two things that are working against you,

[16:28] you have to have this very large discrepancy

[16:31] to put in what it cost you to get a customer,

[16:32] and what you're gonna make from that customer,

[16:34] in order to weather that storm,

[16:35] and allow you to kind of grow into that shit.

[16:37] You can almost grow into your LTVDCAC,

[16:39] which is kind of how I think about it.

[16:40] So if you're thinking about this for you,

[16:43] number one, no what your true LTVDCAC is,

[16:45] and make sure you're doing off-gross profit,

[16:47] not off-of-revenue, and then number two,

[16:50] if you want to scale,

[16:52] make sure that your LTVDCAC ratio

[16:54] is appropriate for the level of leverage

[16:57] that you have within your existing business

[16:59] across all three functions.

[17:00] So you might be wondering,

[17:01] why doesn't the ratio still cover it

[17:04] for a super manual business versus a business

[17:07] that's entirely automated?

[17:08] The main reason is lumpiness.

[17:10] You have to bring people in for outbound

[17:11] that are not gonna be proficient.

[17:12] So you're gonna have to incur the cost of new STRs

[17:15] that either aren't gonna work out at all,

[17:16] or aren't gonna work out in the beginning,

[17:18] and then eventually gonna work out.

[17:18] So you have to incur that cost.

[17:20] But imagine incurring that cost,

[17:21] and then also incurring the cost of new salespeople,

[17:24] who are actually gonna be trying to convert those prospects,

[17:26] and they're gonna suck,

[17:27] and they're gonna lose opportunities,

[17:28] and they're gonna be paying them

[17:29] while they literally close fewer sales for you.

[17:31] So you lose twice.

[17:33] And then also sometimes you spend all this money and time

[17:36] to get them hopefully to be proficient,

[17:38] and then they aren't.

[17:38] So they just lost you money three different ways.

[17:40] The third component of this is the delivery piece,

[17:43] which is like, okay, I'm gonna have to onboard and hire

[17:46] all of these other people,

[17:47] and if you have anything that's like higher expertise,

[17:49] then forget about it.

[17:50] And then you're gonna take even longer for you

[17:51] to both find these people,

[17:53] and then also to train these people up.

[17:55] But again, recruiting itself can be a super expensive

[17:58] tactic, there's recruiting firms.

[17:59] And if you're gonna create a high level person,

[18:00] it usually cost you 25, sometimes 30% of their first year pay.

[18:04] And if you're paying someone 300,000 a year,

[18:06] it's like, you're gonna pay 80 grand just to get somebody,

[18:09] let alone hope that they're proficient,

[18:11] and you still have all this onboarding.

[18:12] So you have this lumpiness of people

[18:15] that aren't gonna be effective.

[18:16] And if you're at three to one, boom, you're done.

[18:19] Like that three to one disappears real fast.

[18:21] It's like you have this lumpiness of like,

[18:23] okay, boom, we got these new STRs in, crack, okay, like,

[18:26] now this is coming back up,

[18:27] but then this starts growing down.

[18:28] So now, like, we start at 20 to 130 to 11,

[18:31] but it's like, it's more like a wave.

[18:33] It like it unglates with the efficiency of the business

[18:37] and how stable it is as you're scaling.

[18:39] And the faster you're scaling,

[18:40] the more inefficient it's going to be.

[18:42] So that's why you need to have as much as you can

[18:44] in terms of all to be the cac.

[18:45] It's padding.

[18:46] The third piece here is that we just went over it.

[18:49] Elty V2CAC, one, we want to make sure that we're doing

[18:51] this off of gross profit, not revenue.

[18:53] And secondarily, we want to make sure that if we are

[18:56] highly leveraged, then we can be at three to one.

[18:59] But if we're low leverage, we want to be at 20 plus,

[19:02] you know, 21 or higher.

[19:03] And again, this sounds crazy and unrealistic for a lot of people.

[19:06] I get it.

[19:07] Fine, at the very least, be at 15 to one.

[19:09] Please, for the love of God, I promise you it's possible.

[19:12] You just have to work on it longer than you expect.

[19:14] Which brings us to number four, let's dive into it.

[19:16] Number four, I've thought, I've said a lot,

[19:18] about this, which is that the one to three million area

[19:22] is a huge swamp.

[19:25] Right, we call it the swamp, at least it actually is not

[19:27] calm.

[19:28] And why is one to three million so hard?

[19:29] Now, we've noticed that it's hard, but we're like,

[19:32] why is that rate hard?

[19:34] Now for those of you who are like, this is not real for me.

[19:35] I'm just trying to make my first $10,000 month.

[19:37] Just keep listening, because believe it or not,

[19:40] some of these things will apply to you.

[19:42] So if you're at one to three million dollars,

[19:43] why is this one of the hardest periods?

[19:45] Because usually from zero to a million,

[19:48] you can usually do it with like you and two three people.

[19:50] It's not that hard for you to keep track of the team.

[19:53] You can usually run very high margins,

[19:55] especially if you're a sole proprietor.

[19:56] You're basically just selling your time, which is fine.

[19:59] You don't need to obsess about your passive income

[20:01] before you max out your active income.

[20:02] Good idea.

[20:03] By the way, a lot of billionaires, very high active income,

[20:05] FYI, anyways.

[20:06] As you're scaling up, that first, you'd

[20:08] a $500, $800, sometimes $1 million a year

[20:10] is actually in some ways somewhere more profitable.

[20:13] Then the next two, three, four million.

[20:15] Because you have to install this level of infrastructure,

[20:18] just like I just can't do it anymore.

[20:20] Now you can always just keep jacking prices,

[20:21] and that's fine, and I'm a big advocate of that.

[20:23] But if you're like, no, I think this is the price

[20:25] that I want to service at, and I want to do more volume,

[20:27] then you're going to have to put in more infrastructure.

[20:29] But this is the math that I just realized

[20:31] is why it's so hard.

[20:33] So let's say you've got a $2 million business.

[20:36] You're right in the middle of the swamp.

[20:37] And you probably noticed, anecdotally,

[20:39] for those of you who were kind of like in this business world,

[20:41] there's a lot of people in the one to three million dollars,

[20:43] like a ton of businesses.

[20:46] To be fair, does that mean they're making $13 million

[20:48] profit?

[20:49] To means they're doing $3 million in revenue, big difference.

[20:51] All right, but let's say we've got a $2 million business,

[20:53] okay?

[20:54] And let's say that they're doing 20% margins.

[20:57] All right, so they're doing $400,000 per year

[21:01] in evener profit, okay?

[21:03] So we have $400,000 here.

[21:05] Now, here's the stick.

[21:07] At this point, for the business to evolve,

[21:10] for the business to level up,

[21:11] the entrepreneur typically has what I would consider

[21:14] an impossible choice.

[21:15] You have to choose one of two things

[21:16] and sometimes the option is both,

[21:18] which is path one, instead of getting more help,

[21:21] I'm just gonna work even more.

[21:23] I'm gonna go from 12 hours a day to working 16 hours a day.

[21:26] I'm gonna stop taking weekends off

[21:28] and I'm gonna basically get through this hump.

[21:30] So I can push my way to $10 million a year,

[21:33] which you can do, it is hard.

[21:37] Or, I'm gonna bring in somebody

[21:39] who's gonna help me get there

[21:41] and I'm gonna maintain a relatively long schedule,

[21:43] but still, you know, not the same as working 16 hours,

[21:46] seven days a week.

[21:47] Those are the kind of the two impossible choices,

[21:49] which is like, other person.

[21:51] Here's the tough part.

[21:52] If you have $400,000 in profit that's left over,

[21:55] if you wanna bring in a stud who's gonna really help you there,

[21:57] you're probably gonna be looking at $250,000 per year

[22:01] in all-in-compt kind of at a minimum

[22:03] to bring somebody who's a real star into the business.

[22:05] Let's look at that in comparison

[22:07] with the profit is for this business.

[22:09] You're looking at risking more than half of your income

[22:12] on one person with the hopes that it's gonna work out.

[22:15] But what happens when this person comes in

[22:17] and then they aren't that good, they don't expand your capacity.

[22:20] It's like, well, shoot.

[22:21] I just lost half my profit for a year

[22:23] and then I'm still not further along.

[22:25] This is why this is the swamp

[22:27] and I've just spent a lot of time thinking about that

[22:29] because I was like, why is one to $3 million so hard?

[22:31] You need the help, but you don't have the money

[22:34] to afford the help.

[22:35] And so you either just gotta go overdrive

[22:37] and go nuts homeode, right?

[22:39] Or you make a huge bet proportional

[22:42] to what you have in terms of net profit

[22:44] to bring this person in.

[22:45] And that's why it's so hard.

[22:47] It's so if you're in the swamp right now,

[22:49] my encouragement to you is this.

[22:51] I have almost always been the, like,

[22:54] I'm gonna go into overdrive

[22:56] and I'm gonna hire the person.

[22:58] Because the idea is, what if I just do things

[23:01] that are more unscalable, but still generate

[23:03] higher profits for the business

[23:04] so that I can afford to take two or three shots

[23:07] with somebody else who's coming into the business,

[23:09] knowing that I'm not gonna get it out of the park

[23:11] on the first shot.

[23:12] I mean, if I do, I'm stoked, but I wanna win either way.

[23:15] And so either I'm gonna win with more profit faster

[23:18] or less profit slower, but I wanna make sure

[23:20] that I'm guaranteed to win.

[23:22] I kind of do this as a plus scenario.

[23:26] So if you happen to be in that one to $3 million range,

[23:28] it's something that we know obviously a lot about

[23:30] with Acquis as not come.

[23:31] And we put together a scaling roadmap.

[23:33] So when we looked at our whole portfolio

[23:35] and the companies that we've worked with over the years,

[23:36] we're like, what are the things?

[23:37] Where do we get stuck and how we get unstuck?

[23:40] And when we put it all together on a map,

[23:42] what we realized that it actually isn't by revenue.

[23:44] It's by head count.

[23:45] You might be doing $1,000 a year and be here

[23:48] or you might be doing $1,000 a year

[23:49] and be at level five, Proxize.

[23:51] So it really depends on the nature of the business that you're in.

[23:54] If you wanna know what level of the scaling roadmap you're at

[23:57] and more importantly, what things we've done

[23:59] in the past four businesses of this size

[24:01] where at this stage to get to the next level,

[24:04] then you're gonna acquisition.com,

[24:05] $4,4,4 roadmap.

[24:06] You put in your business information

[24:07] and it'll spit out and it'll help you pick it out.

[24:09] What stage you're at so that you can get to the next level?

[24:12] On the Think page, if you like our team to help figure out

[24:15] which stage you're at and those specific steps

[24:17] and personalize that, we'd love to invite you out to Vegas.

[24:20] You can book call them the next page

[24:21] and if it's a fit, love to see you.

[24:23] And then the fourth thing we just covered is

[24:25] why one to three million is the hardest.

[24:27] And the main thing is is cash flow and time.

[24:31] You don't have the time and you don't have the cash flow.

[24:33] It's no use doing more work, but you have to in order to grow.

[24:37] So either you work overtime or you bring someone else

[24:39] into work overtime or you do both

[24:42] which is what I recommend and that means it's going to be hard

[24:44] which is why most people stay stuck.

[24:47] So that's number four, number five.

[24:49] So 2024 was probably the first year

[24:53] that I didn't have FOMO.

[24:55] So fear of missing out.

[24:56] It is the hardest part of business is staying focused.

[25:00] It's the hardest part.

[25:00] The reason you hear Basos talk about it

[25:03] and hear his Zuck talk about it.

[25:04] Your job's talk about it, your Elon talk about it.

[25:06] Like you have to be incredibly focused

[25:09] on what the points of greatest leverage

[25:10] are in the business.

[25:11] The reason that this was a big lesson for me,

[25:13] not the focus part.

[25:14] I obviously talk about that.

[25:15] But I was like, why was this your different?

[25:17] Why was this the first year where I didn't have FOMO?

[25:19] It's actually because the idea of rush

[25:22] is where the fear of missing out comes from.

[25:25] It's the arbitrary timeline that I set for myself

[25:28] that I just grab from thin air

[25:30] and then I measure myself against this thing

[25:32] that I made up to make myself miserable

[25:35] at all times from whatever success I'm achieving.

[25:39] In thinking about that, I have coined the term

[25:41] for myself which is that rush is imaginary.

[25:45] It's made up.

[25:46] It's completely made up.

[25:47] There's only one caveat that I'll make to this,

[25:50] which is, and if this is you, you probably already know,

[25:52] if you have a business as a tremendous network effect

[25:55] and there's very small amount of people,

[25:56] even a big amount of people in that network

[25:57] that you're trying to gather towards, then yes,

[25:59] it's likely that you have a winner take all business model

[26:02] in which case you've probably already raised the ton of money

[26:04] and you're probably trying to aggressively grow

[26:06] to capture the networks

[26:07] so that eventually you can turn something

[26:08] into a profitable business.

[26:09] Fine, for everybody else who's not running a tech platform

[26:13] that's trying to build a network effect of some sort,

[26:16] you don't need to rush.

[26:18] There was, honey, actually I don't think

[26:19] her episodes come out yet, but anyways,

[26:21] I'm gonna give you a sneak peek.

[26:23] So I was talking to Oni Trong

[26:25] and she has nail salons, okay?

[26:27] And so she has one Cornell salon that worked really well

[26:31] and then she decided to partner with other people

[26:34] doing like three or four other nail salons

[26:37] and the biggest issue she has for growing right now

[26:39] is that her partnerships are kind of a mess,

[26:41] I'll just put it like that.

[26:41] Why did you do these partnerships?

[26:43] She said because of I had more locations

[26:45] I had a big money and I said,

[26:46] why didn't you just make more money

[26:48] with your existing location, save up the cash

[26:50] and then open a second location all for yourself?

[26:52] The thing that I kept trying to tease out of her

[26:54] is I was like, she was just in a rush.

[26:56] Like that was the reason.

[26:57] She was just in a rush.

[26:58] So there's no actual reason for have three or four

[27:01] other different random partnerships

[27:04] with each of these locations.

[27:06] And the thing is is that some of you guys

[27:07] are you do this?

[27:08] There was a guy who was here at our headquarters yesterday,

[27:11] he has a TikTok shop management thing, right?

[27:14] Where he just like helps people start up there,

[27:15] they're TikTok shops for e-commerce businesses.

[27:17] And he was like, but I also have this brand

[27:19] that I started on my own using TikTok shop

[27:21] and it's doing really, really well.

[27:23] But I also wanna start investing in it and I'm like, dude,

[27:26] what's the rush?

[27:28] And so the counter action, like how do you counter the rush?

[27:31] How do you counter the rush?

[27:32] And I think the way that I have counter the rush

[27:35] is to look at the people who have the ultimate version

[27:37] of my business, who are the people who are 20 years ahead of me?

[27:41] What do their businesses look like?

[27:43] And what's interesting about this

[27:44] is that the vast majority of them have one massive business.

[27:48] And in seeing that I was like, huh,

[27:50] almost none of them have multiple massive businesses

[27:53] they started.

[27:54] Elon is of course the one exception

[27:56] that everybody wants to bring up.

[27:57] And if you're Elon, you already

[27:59] f***ing know how to speak alien.

[28:00] So don't worry about this video.

[28:03] But for everyone who doesn't know how to speak alien, right?

[28:05] For people who haven't just generated $100 billion in a year,

[28:08] if you haven't done that yet,

[28:10] then maybe consider every other person on the Forbes list

[28:13] that just did one thing for the entirety of their career.

[28:18] And it's like, basically it's his blu-er-gen.

[28:19] Yeah, after 35 years of Amazon,

[28:21] you've got Mr. Panda still do, it's like,

[28:24] but wait, he owns the Cosmo.

[28:26] Yeah, but he also did that after 45 years of Panda Express

[28:29] and Panda Express is still his cash cow.

[28:32] Okay, I've got this restaurant, it's working well.

[28:34] Some thing about starting this agency, right?

[28:36] For help restaurants, it's like, dude,

[28:38] what is the ultimate version of this look like?

[28:40] The ultimate version of this look like,

[28:41] either you go all in and you build an enterprise agency

[28:45] that only works with very large restaurant chains.

[28:47] And those tend to be sticky

[28:48] and those tend to be valuable businesses.

[28:50] But if you're like, well, I'm only dealing with

[28:51] small SMB restaurant owners for my agency,

[28:54] show me one, one agency that service SMBs

[28:59] in that thousand, 1500, maybe $2,000 month mark,

[29:03] who has a hundred million dollar plus business,

[29:05] even just like revenue, just show me one,

[29:08] why doesn't it happen?

[29:10] Because it's a bad model.

[29:12] Every single agency goes up market

[29:14] and they serve enterprise in this become really big.

[29:15] Look at Ogil V, look at Vayner, right?

[29:17] Like look at Neil MP Digital, all of these are massive

[29:20] massive companies that only service really,

[29:22] the Fortune 500.

[29:23] Why?

[29:24] Because they're sticky.

[29:25] Because if you have volatile customers,

[29:26] you have a volatile business.

[29:28] If you have volatile business,

[29:29] you're not going to be able to weather the storms.

[29:30] If you can't weather the storms,

[29:32] you're not going to last long.

[29:33] You don't last long, you're not going to get big.

[29:35] How do you counteract the idea of rushing?

[29:38] You have to look at the end state of the business.

[29:40] What is the ultimate version of my restaurant look like?

[29:42] It might be two thousand locations nationwide.

[29:45] What is the ultimate version of my agency look like?

[29:47] It might be Ogil V and Mathers, right?

[29:49] It might be, we're doing, $5 billion a year

[29:52] and let's look at the number of person to space.

[29:53] If what is the ultimate version of my lawn care business look like?

[29:56] Maybe it's a franchise.

[29:58] Maybe it's you privately hold it.

[29:59] But no matter what it is,

[30:00] it's probably not three different businesses

[30:03] that you're trying to start all at the same time

[30:05] because you're in a rush.

[30:06] Because the thing is, is that rush

[30:08] is we'll guarantees you're never going to get big.

[30:11] Then I'm saying this because this is something

[30:13] that has plagued me.

[30:14] My whole career.

[30:16] And so it's just this last year was the first year

[30:18] that I didn't have foam on.

[30:19] And I was like, why is that?

[30:20] And I just think that,

[30:21] I've just failed and messed it up enough times

[30:24] to be like, I just have to stick with one thing.

[30:26] And here's the part about this.

[30:28] You have to accept that you,

[30:30] you can't sleep with every girl.

[30:32] We can't date every guy.

[30:33] Whatever it, whatever your your your preferences.

[30:36] The point is, our life is so limited.

[30:38] It's just so, it's just don't have that many,

[30:40] we don't have that much time.

[30:41] If you want to do big stuff, you just don't have that much time.

[30:43] Because of that, it's like you just have to accept the fact,

[30:46] you just gotta pick.

[30:47] And you could have had four other timelines

[30:50] where you could have done each of these other things

[30:51] all the way to their extreme.

[30:53] But the likely that you're gonna do all four

[30:54] those to the extreme when you start all four

[30:56] than the same time is zero.

[30:58] It's not gonna happen.

[30:59] The first business is built on hard choices.

[31:02] Business is built on the amount of nose

[31:04] that you're able to make.

[31:05] If you can't say no at the beginning of like,

[31:08] I'm not gonna just pick one of these paths, right?

[31:11] One of my favorite little definitions of deciding

[31:14] comes from the Latin Dicodera, which means to cut off.

[31:17] Like if you want to decide,

[31:18] you have to cut off.

[31:19] You have to eliminate things.

[31:20] If you have three different paths

[31:21] or four different things that you're considering,

[31:23] pick for the love of God.

[31:26] And the reason and the thing is is that you have made up

[31:29] some number because some person you know,

[31:31] makes a certain amount of money or some person you know.

[31:33] You think that this amount of revenue is cool.

[31:35] And so you're like, why wanna be cool

[31:37] so I wanna hit that level out of revenue?

[31:38] And because you don't know how to grow the business you're in,

[31:40] you only know how to get to 100,000 a year,

[31:42] you only know how to get to a million dollars a year,

[31:43] only know how to get the $3 million a year.

[31:45] Then your way of growing is doing more $3 million

[31:48] for businesses.

[31:48] When the reality is that you have to confront,

[31:50] why is my $3 million a year business

[31:52] not a $10 million a year?

[31:54] And you have to figure out that problem.

[31:55] That is the hard work.

[31:57] I talked to a lady yesterday,

[31:58] she was stuck at a million dollars a year for 10 years.

[32:00] I said, why haven't you gone to $3 million a year?

[32:03] What's stopped you?

[32:04] Because she had a very clear motto,

[32:05] I was like, why don't you just double how much you're doing?

[32:07] And she was like, well, it's a pain.

[32:08] And I was like, oh, cause it's hard.

[32:10] Cause it's hard.

[32:11] She's like, no, no, it's not cause it's hard.

[32:12] And I was like, well, then why haven't you done it?

[32:15] She's like, well, it's just like, it's inconvenient.

[32:18] And there's like, it's more, it's more time a lot,

[32:20] and all this stuff.

[32:20] And I was like, yeah, that sounds like hard.

[32:23] It sounds like hard.

[32:24] It's hard for us to hear that we're not willing

[32:26] to do hard things because the hard changes.

[32:30] So the hard is constant, but the nature of it changes.

[32:33] Just like suffering as you even being as constant.

[32:35] It's not gonna go away.

[32:36] There's nothing wrong with you

[32:36] because you're suffering while you're in business.

[32:38] It's just the nature of the suffering changes.

[32:40] In the beginning, no one knows you exist.

[32:42] And that's tough.

[32:43] Cause you feel ignored and irrelevant.

[32:44] And then you start to let people know about your stuff.

[32:46] And then as soon as that happens,

[32:47] you have a different kind of hard,

[32:48] which is that no one wants to give you money.

[32:50] And then obviously, the people start giving you money.

[32:51] And then what happens?

[32:52] Then people start complaining

[32:53] because you're things not that good.

[32:54] But all of these things are hard.

[32:56] And so we have this idea that it's this rocky cutscene

[32:59] that we're gonna be fighting.

[33:00] It's like we're gonna just keep greeting through it.

[33:02] But it's like, no, we are so equipped to save our egos

[33:06] that we will come up with a hundred ways

[33:08] that our hard is not hard.

[33:10] It's different because we're special.

[33:12] But the reality is hard morphs.

[33:14] That's what makes people get stuck

[33:16] because they learn how to conquer one hard,

[33:18] but not the next kind of hard.

[33:19] I think that a lot of the hardness is,

[33:22] is sometimes learning is saying no.

[33:24] It's learning to focus.

[33:25] That's the hard part.

[33:26] It's not getting punched in the face.

[33:28] It's being willing to let one of your children die.

[33:32] To let the other one live.

[33:33] We get the Sophie's choice.

[33:35] We actually do have to do that in business all the time.

[33:38] And so you have to accept that there is a life

[33:41] in the future that you will not be able to live.

[33:44] And it's actually, it's honestly, it's acceptance.

[33:46] And this has just been a really good lesson for me,

[33:49] which is like, there are opportunities

[33:51] that I think I could crush.

[33:52] And I think they're amazing.

[33:53] And you know what?

[33:54] I'm never gonna be able to do them.

[33:56] Because I still have the one that I'm working on right now

[33:58] and I have to continue to say yes to this

[34:00] and by saying yes to this,

[34:01] I have to say note everything else.

[34:03] These have been the five big business lessons

[34:05] that I've learned more recently

[34:07] and I thought you might enjoy them.

[34:09] Have an amazing day.

[34:10] And I'm sure I have other videos

[34:12] that you can find somewhere along here

[34:14] that if you like this, you'll like this.

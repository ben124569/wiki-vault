[00:00] What do we really want to do? Like what's the actual impact? If at the end of our lives

[00:03] We have something that is a shining beacon of a different way to do business that to me is something we're fighting for

[00:15] I am working on the book

[00:20] You know it's gonna happen when everyone sees this moment

[00:23] What?

[00:24] We're gonna be like when is the book coming?

[00:25] Yeah

[00:26] What do you have to say?

[00:28] Ow

[00:30] Oh, what the hell?

[00:31] I don't know what is it?

[00:32] We can mention it, but you just like insert it casually in this block

[00:39] That's pretty big deal honestly. They just found out for the first time

[00:42] That's right. I get some messages that are like offended. They're like, yo, what the fuck? Where's the

[00:48] Like I need some leads broke you me

[00:51] This is really the first time we're kind of seeing you in the morning and you're not meditating

[00:57] You're not dreaming about your life, son

[01:00] I mean I sure normally I have like a three hour routine just so that I've

[01:05] Capable to function as a human being I have a long affirmation routine that I do is a wall mirror over there that I just that's right

[01:11] Just say them to myself

[01:14] Your amazing

[01:16] Fantastic people love you

[01:21] Comments don't mean anything

[01:23] Like is it the captain's a ready this is the cat all the cat the

[01:28] Wow

[01:29] So you drink it just because you like the play

[01:32] Actually I drink whatever lately usually drinks because it's easier for me to just be like two if someone gets plastic surgery right of any kind

[01:42] The real real is that like either say nothing or

[01:46] Be positive about it because they can't change it like you wouldn't say it that to somebody who didn't have their nurse change

[01:53] But the the feature is still permanent

[01:56] I don't know guy message me

[01:58] He started coming on all my post that he was like people horrible all the shit

[02:02] And then I like looked in my inbox and he was like messaging and he was like

[02:06] You don't want what's best for us because you did you would give us the thing of your plastic surgery

[02:11] He's like you want us all to be poured out of the other exact

[02:14] He's like you just don't want us to see there are days where like Lail would be not in his get of a mood

[02:18] And I would try and be like hey, what can I do like let me do these things and

[02:22] She would still stay in a kind of a bad mood and so then what happened is I would then get stirred and be like

[02:28] All right do your own thing and what happened is that she would then step out of it

[02:33] As soon as I got mean

[02:35] And so then what she taught me is that if I am mean she will stop being in a bad mood

[02:39] What about

[02:41] Right as soon as you have started having punishment in a room

[02:44] Award as as things in your in your dialect and thinking what happens afterwards kids cry

[02:48] Parent gives them a cookie and you now teach them to cry to get cookies like it's just like so simple

[02:53] And the other pieces if you reward too long afterwards you still teach them something

[02:59] But not what you intended a parent for example fast forward

[03:03] Has a teenager who sneaks out of the house

[03:06] Right and then they come back at in the middle of the night

[03:10] And then as soon as they walk in the door they punish them and so what happens

[03:14] You punish a kid for coming home

[03:18] And then their surprise to get doesn't want to come up

[03:20] Well, what's your data?

[03:21] What's your time to agenda?

[03:23] Leadership meeting

[03:25] Pipeline review

[03:27] Book meeting

[03:28] I have a biweekly with two of our teammates that I try and do with some of the

[03:33] Non-executive team

[03:34] And you do that every day you try and block up until like noon or one?

[03:38] Yeah

[03:39] And then Lael has been doing such a good job though that there are more days where I

[03:44] Just have nothing on my calendar at all. Which is awesome and amazing

[03:52] Just have more time to work

[03:55] Farewell farewell my love

[03:58] Sweet queen

[04:01] Little guy for a guy

[04:03] You want a little guy?

[04:05] Everybody start the day

[04:07] You can see my little model of workstation. I've got my iPad which is where I draw my stuff. I've got ear plugs

[04:13] I've got my nicker at my work time. We're going so I actually don't use it all the time

[04:17] It's more during the week

[04:18] Because people ping me. I'll just set my timer for really how long I think something's gonna take and then I'll hit it

[04:23] I just keep it right like in plain sight and that works really well

[04:27] So interesting combo is if you go headphones ear muffs

[04:32] Nicteen caffeine and like work and the timer

[04:36] I get to find like a better combination of the product's equity use if useful

[04:42] Really realize that I'd love to do with acquisition.com

[04:51] Is be able to build acquisition.com to whatever a billion 10 billion

[04:56] Reading with raise not a shipment if we could really do this and then teach other CEOs how to do this

[05:04] That's something worthwhile doing and it's not like anybody else and on the same side

[05:08] We have our mission which is to make real this is such a occasionally available to everybody

[05:13] There's often two visions in a company. There's the internal vision which is much more

[05:17] Relevant to team and the employees and the vendors that I don't really touch and even the customers and then there's the external vision

[05:23] It's like how are we affecting the greater community that is affected by acquisition.com

[05:29] And I think that we actually really have

[05:31] As we've clarified this conversation it's been an ongoing dialogue between Lailin. I have like

[05:36] What do we really want to do like what's the actual impact at the end of our lives?

[05:40] We have something that is a shining beacon of a different way to do business that is more

[05:44] Profitable by building something bigger and better but do it our way which is praise over punishment

[05:50] That to me is something worth fighting for it. It just takes more skill

[05:54] Because when someone messes up all you want to do is punish them. How can I not do that?

[05:59] And then get the desire result. We will define somebody who is motivated by reward or reinforcement as someone who is

[06:07] Who utilizes all of their discretionary effort. So if there's the level of effort that is required to knock it fired and then all the effort above that is

[06:15] discretionary effort in a business that is based on punishment

[06:19] People will go to the law of least effort which is as little as they can do to knock it fired

[06:23] So if you have a business that's based on that then how do you get higher performance? Well look at McKinsey

[06:28] Look at Goldman Sachs look at a lot of the P industry you raise the bar

[06:32] And so what happens is you get really high performers or the elements who can perform in that in that place and they are driven by anxiety

[06:38] They're stressed out of their minds. They drink. They do drugs. They get hooked on porn whatever it is

[06:43] Right to to deal with the stressors in their life. You just move the bar

[06:46] And so the alternative is a world where everybody is working

[06:50] Even harder than that because the law of of least effort

[06:53] There's still people that are so talented that they can work medium and not get fired

[06:59] But you lose out on all of the discretionary effort that they would be putting in if they felt that they were being reinforced in a safe place

[07:05] And so that's the kind of environment that we're trying to build. I'm not saying we're perfect. We will mess up

[07:10] But that's that's I think something that's worth fighting for

[07:14] I really think that we have a shot that like pulling the body into principles

[07:17] We have to change so many people's lives. So fun story

[07:22] One of our teammates went to an event

[07:25] Then was rocking and I couldn't stop. I'm not comfortable. I'm not sure

[07:28] They're not for sale obviously and

[07:30] Many people came up to him asking to take pictures with him invited him after drinks invited me off for food to

[07:36] portions of the day that he wasn't allowed to go and to but you was able to because he was wearing that shirt

[07:41] So how does that happen?

[07:43] They re-abuck that gives them value they're reinforcing rewarded for that thing and then when they do this stuff from the book

[07:49] They associated the rewards they get from that with the book the book they associated with me

[07:55] And then they see me in all the videos and all the content with this thing and so eventually you're moved me

[08:01] And you just keep the thing and you associate that thing with all these good feelings all this reward

[08:09] And to then someone else works the shirt and then they feel the same way towards that person

[08:15] Simply because they have associated so many good things with that and that is branding and yes, let's switch to pipeline

[08:21] That would allow us to do that kind of vision of the 49 or 51 for new companies just adding them straight to kind of like our top line bottom line

[08:30] That would be a huge move

[08:35] So there's our pipeline review so it's looking at companies at different stages in the deal process and you know mind you of people

[08:42] We even get to this level 95% of deals we don't do

[08:46] It's just because we're looking for a lot of very specific things

[08:48] It's not just necessarily like is the company viable but like can we add value to the company?

[08:52] I'm not really there's two schools of investing there's betters and builders

[08:55] So betters are like can I find a mispriced company that I will simply put money in at less than its intrinsic value and then hope that it will grow over time

[09:04] That's kind of like the warm buffets style probably the vast majority of investors are that way and then there are

[09:09] Builders to have like a unique set of skills in their hold code that they can try and

[09:14] Templatize those kind of like SOPs those play books and just deploy them into the company is knowing that they're going to triple five x 10x

[09:21] The companies that they have private equity is usually a combination of both those things

[09:25] I would say that we lean towards the building side if like we're not trying to be like amazing pickers

[09:29] We just try and find companies that we know our playbooks will immediately 10x and then try and work with them

[09:40] Gosh

[09:42] In the in the new place how we able to fit my entire wardrobe in my bedside table. Oh, yeah

[09:46] We'll show a laz entire closet and then I'll pull out my two drawers with beaters and shorts

[09:51] I'll be great. Why are you so obsessed about it?

[09:55] Well, I will say this. I don't know why I know that I am I have become more that way

[10:02] Because it's probably been reinforced more obsessive. I am about like iterating things until they're like just right

[10:09] The more rewarded I get

[10:10] Trevor saying that like that he's alarmed by the number of people that he has worked with who do not read well

[10:15] He said we need to teach them to read

[10:17] He got a kid who was struggling to stay focused and so he came to train the kid with a bag of skills

[10:22] They the kid would read three words and he would give him a skittle

[10:25] But if he read four words because if his previous best was three you could give him two skills

[10:30] So we reinforce him doing it every time he had a

[10:33] Bigger reinforcement for when every time he hit a new record

[10:36] So if he read a full line

[10:38] He would give him more by the end of the first session he had them reading entire pages. Hello

[10:46] So we're doing this whole vlog thing so we're capturing day in the life the very you know the high energy

[10:52] Live and see who lives in closet

[10:57] Yeah, I mean like I don't see an issue with translating into more languages like that doesn't bother with

[11:02] Then we just have more people get the book can they do Mandarin or Japanese or Portuguese

[11:07] Portuguese would be big German I got a lot of DMs after I showed the French one

[11:11] So that was a meeting with my book manager who also happens to give my father-in-law

[11:16] So we have massively improved our relationships since the first time I stole his daughter

[11:20] Told her to quit everything to join me to go home and across the country living in motel six weeks after we met

[11:27] But yeah, he runs everything with the book so we have a French and a Spanish version out and then looking at other

[11:32] languages that we want to translate it into and looking at publishing and printing firms in Germany and

[11:37] Italy so that's kind of what that that meeting was about we got

[11:40] Different versions of the books as they

[11:43] Progressed over time from different printers so that I could see the print quality

[11:47] Just so you guys know I don't go to one printer and go to a bunch of them and make sure that the book quality is good

[11:52] And if you're like why are you even dealing with this rather than going to a publisher?

[11:55] This publishers don't want you to give away your free

[11:58] And so I

[12:00] You know Uncle Alex puts the bill. I'll have probably a million

[12:05] I had it up probably like a million two into this book

[12:08] Negative I mean that's why most publishing companies will front the money

[12:12] I know what have done that with this book just so you guys know

[12:15] Except if I had done it with this book it wouldn't be out until

[12:20] Spring of 24 like it has to be 100% done nine months before you actually get it

[12:26] I finished this and then I'm releasing it 16

[12:29] Exactly or stop and that's because 12 weeks is printing if I want to just do like dropship real time printing and then wanted everyone to wait

[12:37] Forever I would do it that way, but

[12:40] It's also way more expensive to print that way and you know the books fund emoji media

[12:46] Which is really so you guys know where did the dollars go from the from my $2.99

[12:50] In books that I get a dollar from it goes to go to the team so we can put out more stuff for you guys to buy it

[12:55] What's up man tell me your most painful moment

[12:59] Should I make I'll see what's going on pain falls tough act. I mean like cutting my eyeball that sucks

[13:06] I took sales cost out yeah

[13:10] I would scare you pain and all you

[13:12] Fixing the sales issue here's what's crazy is that if the other guy gets up to 40 a double sales

[13:17] I think that if I had a two-prong approach get a good salesman there and then double the throughput on the webinar

[13:22] I'd say like that's a four-axle who double double

[13:24] Times people ask why don't you make

[13:27] videos like you used to why why the change why all the editing

[13:32] The new thumbnails all that shit

[13:34] More people said

[13:36] I mean it's just that we see the comments this actually reminds me of a store that you told me but like whenever a band goes from like a small town to like

[13:43] They go they go bigger audience they go more mass market

[13:47] You've were like the band selling out or whatever it is but the reality is that like the band morphs into the thing that reaches the most people

[13:54] And so if you believe in the message that you have been packaging it in a way that allows the most people to consume it

[14:01] If you believe in what you want to get out there as long as it doesn't dilute the the core message

[14:06] Which I don't think I said it anymore heavily and having higher produced videos does just gets more people see it and so

[14:13] Here's the thing is that everyone in

[14:15] Mosingation boats with their clicks and their eyeballs about the things they find most interesting and so you train me

[14:23] To make the content that I have

[14:25] So if y'all in general

[14:28] Like the webcam only thing more than I would be making more of that

[14:34] But you train me with your clicks and your watches of the things that you care the most about and so we make more of this

[14:40] So in many ways you guys control the content and to all the day one home is

[14:44] Appreciate you all many you guys were like at 5k we're like dude this guy's gonna be in a million

[14:50] And it's true

[14:51] Got there, but it was just because you guys appreciate you guys sharing

[14:54] Commiting send it to your friends all what kind of stuff

[14:57] I feel really confident in saying that like in two years you will laugh at what we're putting out right now

[15:03] I know I certainly will there are some things that are gonna get released that are going to blow

[15:08] What we are doing on the water we like to say we think a decade's not days

[15:12] But I think you can just

[15:15] Watch and see if I have more full of it or not

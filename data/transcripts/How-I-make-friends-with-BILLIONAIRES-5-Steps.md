[00:00] Would you like to know how to network with millionaires and billionaires?

[00:04] Well, having now met a lot of billionaires in my life and tried to build my own network of cool and interesting people,

[00:13] I continue to get questions on this channel about how to do that.

[00:17] And so I wrote down kind of five rules that I have kind of lived by and, you know, my wife talks about this,

[00:23] just like, Alex is the networker of you know between us.

[00:27] And a lot of the things that I've had happened in my life that have been good have happened as a result of a conversation or a connection that I've had

[00:34] from someone I've met randomly, right?

[00:36] And so I think that there's something to be said for having a deliberate process for networking without seeming like a skis, right?

[00:42] Which is just like, how can I meet cool people and just improve their lives while also improving my life?

[00:48] I know the saying like, your network is your, your network is your network. I'm not sure how much I believe that,

[00:53] but I do think that a lot of the big things in my life have as a result of other people, all right?

[00:58] So here are the five rules that I will share with you that, and there's two of them that are really, really good,

[01:04] number like four and five that I highly highly recommend and I don't hear anyone else say.

[01:08] All right, so the first one, really simple is whenever someone introduces themselves, you always want to make sure that you remember their name, right?

[01:14] And so what I do is whenever I shake someone's hand, I say their name and I keep saying it in ep like the beginning of every sentence I say.

[01:21] And I do it that way because I want to say like 10 times throughout the conversation and it'll stick with me.

[01:27] And I'm usually pretty good at remembering names and people remember that.

[01:30] It's the favorite word in whatever language someone's added, their own name is their favorite word to hear.

[01:36] All right, and so you want to say to them as much as you can because then they will know that you cared and you gave them respect and made them feel more important, all right?

[01:43] So number one is always remember the name when you say them a lot of times.

[01:46] Number two, you've got to get the contact info and otherwise like you know you're not going to actually have the network.

[01:51] So what I do when I get someone's contact info is I immediately text them and I text them some sort of funny anecdote about myself or the conversation we were just having.

[02:01] Right? And so for me it might be like I'll say their name and my name in the text because sometimes you forget to save the contact.

[02:07] All right, so it's like Alex Ramozi, a mustache, gym guy, right, or something like that, right?

[02:13] I would say something in that vein and then I would say nice to meet you and then you know Sam Gamjee, whatever, right?

[02:22] And so if I do in that they see I see both names are there. They know relevant stats about me and if you want to be extra bonus put their stuff in there too

[02:32] for an attribute whatever, right?

[02:34] And so that way you won you gained rapport with that early on to you got their contact info and the thing is is when they look back at that text thread later

[02:43] if you can get them to laugh a little bit don't remember oh yeah that was that cool guy I hear that funny or you know that that that do do was relatively upbeat and pleasant

[02:50] So I would like to contact him again in the future right now rule number three

[02:55] Always provide value first unsolicited all right, so this is a key point if you had a conversation the

[03:01] The goal of the conversation should be to figure out how you provide value to the person not what that person can do for you all right

[03:06] It's a big one the goal and if you really want to truly build a great network

[03:11] You have to give first and you have to give it unsolicited all right, so it's like hey

[03:15] I know you were talking about this I pulled up a bunch of these suppliers that I've worked with in the past

[03:19] I thought this might be valuable for you and honestly the more work you do in this

[03:23] Unsolicited give the more people were spec to you and want to do business with you and keep you in their lives because you provided value first

[03:31] All right to keep you. You provided value

[03:33] First sorry about the smudgy weird as camera shit rule number four and this is the biggest one

[03:38] This is like my biggest secret to networking so write this down

[03:43] Always say yes to the first ask all right always say yes to the first ask the reason it's so important is that people like people aren't gonna

[03:51] Try a lot of times to be your friend if you met up at a at a networking event or you met at a mastermind

[03:56] or you met at a something

[03:58] Right and the net the first ask to be like, hey, let's touch base next week on a zoom or hey, let's meet up in person or hey

[04:05] I'm in I'm in town where you're at you want to grab lunch. I always do everything in my power to say yes to the first ask which means that sometimes on move stuff

[04:13] That's already there to accommodate the first meetup all right because I have learned this and I learned this really early in my life

[04:21] That people only ask once and most times if you don't get that first ask they'll never ask you get

[04:27] Right, so we want to take advantage of now if you're on the asking side the key is to ask many many many times

[04:34] Right, but if you're on the receiving end say yes to the first ask so the two sides of that one are say yes to the first ask and

[04:40] If you were the one who's asking ask multiple times because sometimes life comes up and sometimes the people

[04:45] That will end up being huge players in your life later

[04:49] Sometimes they just get busy and it has nothing to do with you rule four always say us the first ask and rule number five

[04:55] never ask for anything

[04:57] Just don't do it because they'll immediately assume that you are trying to use them for something

[05:02] All right, and so if anything if you if you need help on something and you're hoping that's a little help you then what you can do is when you're catching up

[05:09] You can describe a problem that you're currently dealing with if you have any level of rapport in this person wants to have a continued

[05:15] Relationship with you they will usually offer help to help you out

[05:19] All right, and so what you can do is don't ask them for anything you can describe a problem that you're dealing with and

[05:24] Talk about it and then usually they will they will make a

[05:28] A reasonable ask and this is why giving first is important because people are reciprocal in nature

[05:32] If you give and you give well and you give unsolicited early and you never ask for anything

[05:37] People will find a way to give back to you unless the person really doesn't want to be your friend in which case

[05:42] You don't need to be friends because at the end of the day if you want to have a network that you actually enjoy

[05:46] Then you want to network with cool people who you know are reciprocal nature and want to give back to

[05:50] So there's the five rules for that working that have served me very well the last two especially

[05:55] Probably the most important which is never you know always always say us to the first ask or ask multiple times if it's you

[06:01] And never ask for anything

[06:04] Inter from them because then they will always see you as a positive force of giving that is always just helping them out

[06:09] And they will be more inclined to to to build a relationship with you in the future and wanted you business with you all right

[06:15] So there's the five rules for networking

[06:17] Most in action

[06:18] Keep being awesome

[00:00] In this video, I'm going to show you the seven ways to measure business value and how you're

[00:05] probably being deceived by most people you see on the internet simply because you're not

[00:09] understanding the words in terms they are using.

[00:14] Alright, so by the end of this video, you'll understand who's BS, who's legit, who's real,

[00:17] who's fake and if they haven't given you enough information to make the decision,

[00:21] exactly what questions to ask. Alright, so let's dive in. So the first of the seven types of ways

[00:26] that people will measure value is that they will extrapolate a single month of contract value

[00:31] into eternity or at least over a year. Example, what that looks like is someone selling a yearly

[00:36] contract in an event, they saw a hundred people at that event, let's say, for $30,000 a year. And they

[00:42] say, we're doing $3 million a month. Wow, right crazy. But the reality is they sold $3 million

[00:50] of contracts that are unenforcible to people on monthly income streams, or monthly cash flow.

[00:56] And so a hundred people at $2,500 a month is what will get you to that $30,000, right? Roughly,

[01:02] what really means is they did $250,000 that that event. But they said, I'm doing $3 million a month,

[01:09] right, even though it was a one time event that is not going to recur and they based it on

[01:14] contract value and not payments collected. And so the first way to see through this stuff is to say,

[01:19] well, how much money was actually collected and how reliable are the contracts that you're actually

[01:24] selling. If you have highly secured contracts with companies that are legit or you have them secured

[01:30] against assets, meaning that they're likely that they continue as high or you have a negative

[01:33] turn company, meaning the contract increases in value over time based on the business economics that

[01:38] you have, like sales force, for example, when you sign a contract with sales force, you sign a contract

[01:42] with HubSpot, which is another CRM, most of those clients increase how much they spend over time.

[01:47] And so that would be legit in that instance. But the vast majority of people who are saying this to

[01:51] are not being legit. And so first thing to look out for at the very end, I'll give you my rating

[01:56] for each of these ways of doing it. All right, the second is lifetime revenue. So this is when someone

[02:02] says, we've done X amount of total revenue collected in our business. A lot of times to say, I have a,

[02:07] I mean, I see an ad right now that I run all the time. It's like how I built a $50 million business.

[02:12] But they mean how much revenue they've collected over the lifetime of the business. And so for context

[02:17] of how ridiculously inflated this will be, McDonald's employee will collect a million dollars

[02:22] in revenue as income. Honestly, that's even better because it's income. It's not even revenue. But like

[02:28] just to show you how ridiculous and preposterous it says, a McDonald's employee will collect that

[02:32] over the entire life. So if you work to McDonald's or a life, right? And so if you, if you use this

[02:35] metric, then it's incredibly inflating and it's great for it. You go and it sounds good to impress

[02:39] people who don't know what you're talking about. Okay. And so you may have seen one of my videos

[02:44] that said 122 million in revenue for me. And I do that a because the headline is more compelling than

[02:50] saying, you know, we've done mid 30s for the last three or four years. You know, I'll play the game too.

[02:54] But understanding what that comes from. And so that's why I try and be as honest as possible.

[02:58] Like, well, this is what we did in revenue. This is what we did in profit. So that I can just be

[03:01] transparent with everybody so you know, at least what to look for. And so when someone says,

[03:05] we have a $50 million business or a $100 million business asked them, are you talking about

[03:10] yearly revenue? Are you talking about profit? Like, what are you talking about specifically when you say

[03:14] that number? Right? And a lot of times we were like, well, I mean, I guess that's how much, you know,

[03:19] total revenue we've done, you know, since we started. Now mind you, most entrepreneurs, especially

[03:23] new entrepreneurs will conflate, they will mix revenue with cash collected. Right? Those are two very

[03:30] different things. Right? Revenue is is contract value, right? But cash collected is really reality.

[03:36] And so they'll use this term. And for the purpose of this video, when I say revenue, I mean cash

[03:40] collected. What was processed and received by the business. So the second way that people describe

[03:45] their values, how much total revenue they've done in a lifetime. So you may actually have seen,

[03:49] you can see this a work kind of over here. I got for doing a $100 million or passing a $100

[03:53] million until revenue in three years, three and a half years, I think. Since we started with

[03:59] click-phones, which is a software that we used for landing pages. And they recognized the people

[04:03] were top performers. But again, that's revenue. Like, it doesn't mean it means cash collected. But

[04:08] it doesn't mean that like, we're doing that per year. Now, this year is a breakout year.

[04:12] And I'll tell you what we do at the end of this year, because we will be close to that number.

[04:15] I don't think we'll cross 100 million this year. But we'll be really close. Number three is business

[04:22] valuation. So this one is one where it's based on the market's value of the business if it were sold.

[04:27] So this is another way of kind of inflating the business that you have. Now, this isn't necessarily

[04:32] an unfair way of valuing a business, right? Based on its own value. But the thing is, is it all

[04:37] depends on who's the one who's a scribe in the value? What are they? What are they using to create

[04:41] that value? I hear all the time, like, well, I think I'm able to get 15 times top line. You don't know

[04:47] squat, right? The market will pay with the market will pay. All right? And so for most businesses

[04:52] that are small businesses, so anything that's under $5 million a year in revenue, most of those

[04:56] guys are getting two to three times EBITDA, which is another measurement we get to in a second,

[05:01] which is the earnings before interest, tax and organization and depreciation, right? And so those are

[05:06] business metrics that is going to have a multiple scribe to it. So if you're a mid market,

[05:11] which would be like $10,000,000 in revenue per year, then you might have a six to eight times

[05:16] multiple. If you get above $100,000, then a lot of times you can get into the, you know, 12s, 15s,

[05:22] et cetera. And most of the time that's done on EBITDA, in a very, very, very rare number of circumstances,

[05:28] will they do it on top line revenue, right? And that is in a fast growth company that has

[05:32] high amounts of capital that need to be reinvested in it that they believe are going to give it

[05:35] a strategic advantage for high-growth profits in the future that the reinvesting capital into.

[05:41] All right? And so that's where, you know, I saw somebody recently saying that they had,

[05:44] you know, they sold their business for a hundred times EBITDA, right? What that really means is that,

[05:48] like, and this is where this is what I want everybody to watch this video to be thinking,

[05:52] well, either they had a really, really crazy business, or more likely they were making almost no

[05:57] profit in their business and just got a high valuation because of, or not even a necessarily high valuation.

[06:02] If they're doing a, you know, 10,000 dollars a year in profit on a $5 million business,

[06:06] then if they sell for, you know, $5 million, they get 500 times even though, which is ridiculous, right?

[06:12] But people do that because it sounds impressive, right? So that's why that's why we're going through this.

[06:16] So you can cut through the BS and hopefully get better sources of information, which is kind of my goal here,

[06:20] is that you can measure, you can measure other entrepreneurs' value based on the true value that they've been providing.

[06:25] All right? So the next one here is yearly revenue, all right? So this is how much revenue a business is doing yearly.

[06:32] Now we're getting a little bit closer to reality here. Now again, revenue versus cash collected,

[06:36] it depends on the type of business. If you have a service business that's based on recurring revenue

[06:39] in contracts, then you're going to have contracts that are affected. And that if you had an

[06:41] e-commerce business, for example, which is purely transactional, then the revenue in cash flexor

[06:45] you're going to be very close to each other. Right? And, you know, revenue would also not take into account

[06:49] refunds, charge vaccines like that, which then gets into net revenue. I won't get into it. There's a

[06:53] zillion terms and just as a side note here, the reason there are so many terms is because measuring

[06:59] value is something that is one of the hardest aspects of investing in business in general. Is that

[07:03] people want to figure out what is this thing worth? And so that's why they have lots of different

[07:06] metrics that look at and so for you as a keen entrepreneur or investor or person who wants to grow

[07:13] within the business world, understanding all of these metrics and how they work together to assess

[07:18] or get as close to true value as possible, are these are going to be tools in your skillset.

[07:22] And some of these are better and some of these are worse and I'll get to my ratings in a second.

[07:26] So you really revenues the next one, which is just how much are you doing every year in terms of

[07:29] top line. Right? Now, the next one is profit or even. Now, these two things are not necessarily the same,

[07:36] but I'm going to say, EBITDA being earnings before interest tax depreciation and mortization, right?

[07:41] For most businesses, this is where coming back to the business valuation, if you're mid-market,

[07:46] you're getting six to eight, if you're kind of smaller than you're at, you know, two to three,

[07:49] sometimes four, if you're doing really well, or you have some sort of competitive advantage. And so,

[07:53] and then again, every sound soft to you in terms of those numbers, but the reality is that a lot of

[07:57] people just look at the outliers, which catch all the news in the press, but most businesses,

[08:02] every, you know, businesses are sold every day at 1x, 2x, 3x, EBITDA all the time. Just no one wants to talk about it, right?

[08:10] And so this is even closer to reality. So if I'm looking at a business owner or somebody's

[08:14] trying to posture with me right, the eggplant measuring contest of entrepreneurship, they're going to,

[08:20] if they're starting to talk to me about these numbers, I'm like, hey, bro, like, what are we doing

[08:23] bottom line? Right? What are we doing bottom line per year? This is what I want to know. And so,

[08:27] that leaves me naturally to the next one, which is, okay, well, you've got a, you've got a certain amount of

[08:32] EBITDA that's coming up, but depending on your type of business, you might have to reallocate all that

[08:35] money back into the business to just maintain your competitive advantage, which, Charlie Munger,

[08:40] Warren Buffett, they talk about how their least favorite type of businesses are businesses that require

[08:45] lots of additional capital, right? Now, as they become gazillionaires, they have to find businesses

[08:49] like that because they have to put their capital work, but for, with the thing that created their

[08:52] role of this finding businesses that did not require a lot of additional capital that created lots of

[08:56] survey says, net free cash flow. So how much owner earnings, how much can you extract from the business?

[09:04] All right? That's what this NFCF here. Here is net free cash flow, right? Now, I've talked about this

[09:08] into the videos, but this is after I've reinvested profits in the business to maintain and grow

[09:13] our competitive advantage, how much can I as the owner take out? The reason this is so important is

[09:18] because a lot of times you're not going to sell. A lot of times businesses fail. There are tons of

[09:22] risks. That's why business is one of the riskiest things to get into. Most businesses do not succeed.

[09:26] That's just, those are just the stats, right? And 99 times out of 100, you business never actually

[09:31] sells. You might do an asset sale or a garage sale, but doesn't actually sell for what you think

[09:34] it is, which is why for me, as an entrepreneur, you want to derisk by extracting cash flow.

[09:39] And many times, this is one of the values of the business. And so, from talking to an entrepreneur,

[09:43] and they tell me this, then I'm going to probably ask, well, what are you big? What are you taking

[09:46] home and owner earnings? What are you extracting from business? What are you taking out its dividends?

[09:49] We don't want to know what's reality, right? And that leads me to the last and the bottom one here

[09:54] and I'll give you my ratings on these, which is what's your net worth? This is what entrepreneurs,

[09:58] you know, everyone's shying away from talking about. A lot of guys that you see on your new

[10:02] speed, those guys message me and say, hey man, I want to do X1, Z1, Z1, start investing, etc.

[10:07] and they've got a half a million dollars for their name and they talk about how they've done

[10:09] $10 million in revenue, right? Life time. And so, again, you could just, I'll give you

[10:16] a funny example for it. So, if someone says, hey, we've done a million dollars in revenue,

[10:20] look at our award, right? That's over a total lifetime, right? That could be over 10 years.

[10:24] So, if you did a million dollars in revenue, 10 years, it means you've done a 100,000 years in revenue,

[10:29] right? And if you're doing 50% margins on that, right? That's a $50,000

[10:33] year owner income business, which is just the median income of the United States and there's

[10:37] nothing wrong with that. But in terms of taking this person as an authority, I would be,

[10:41] I would be hesitant to take their advice because, candidly, they're probably just spending

[10:47] what they're making on living if that's how they're trying to position. So, just take that

[10:52] with a grain of salt, you know what I mean? And the reason I'm going through this is because I

[10:56] the best thing you can do is learn from others. But to make sure that you're actually learning

[11:00] from others, learning from people who are good information sources is important. And there's

[11:04] tons of people in a way more about business. But I just try to share this stuff that has worked

[11:07] well for us, in creating, you know, for me, an ultra-high net worth, which is over 30 million.

[11:11] And there's two aspects of net worth, all right? You have your net worth that comes from your

[11:17] investable assets, which is what you've extracted, right? We've extracted, paid your taxes on,

[11:22] and then been able to reinvest and grow. And the second is the percentage of the businesses that you

[11:27] own, business or businesses that you own. All right, which is why having a fair and reasonable

[11:31] valuation is important because what's the true market value of the business that you have?

[11:35] Now, if someone says like my business does like $10 million a year and they do $2 million of

[11:40] EBITDA, right? And they're getting a five times multiple on that because it's truly a business

[11:45] and doesn't require their face. If it requires their face, then they're not going to get that

[11:48] multiple. Right? So it's important to understand these variables that create and measure value

[11:54] in a business because if you're looking for people and you're trying to listen to advice,

[11:57] then make sure you're getting it from the sources that are true and real. Again, two different ways

[12:02] that can combine to create net worth is going to be your after tax, wealth that you've extracted

[12:07] from the business and be able to reinvest on the side and grow on your own, right? And the percentages

[12:13] of the businesses that you own in the value rather. All right, so let's get to the good part, which is

[12:18] yeah, your name is this something that I'd be looking at in terms of whether I'm going to value

[12:22] this person's opinion based on this stat alone. Survey says contract value, no, I would not do that

[12:29] and that is because this can be wildly inflated especially if you extrapolate on one month's

[12:35] contract value for the rest of the year, it can be wildly inflated. All right, so number two,

[12:40] lifetime revenue survey says no, I would not use this as a way of measuring how good someone is

[12:46] at at business because you want to know how long was that? Was it over 20 years? Was it over 40

[12:51] years? Because that's what McDonald's employee can earn over that amount of time. All right, so don't

[12:56] be impressed by this number, ask more questions which we which you should hopefully do as we go

[13:01] down this. All right, business valuation survey says yes, but caveat on this, you want to know

[13:07] what kind of multiple are you assuming and what is that off of top line or bottom line and why can

[13:12] you defend that, right? So this is asking good questions so that you can actually get closer to true

[13:16] value, which is why all these metrics even exist to begin with, it's that people want to describe

[13:20] and measure value. All right, next one, yearly revenue survey says, ah, partial answer because it

[13:26] goes with number five, which is yearly profit, all right, the difference here. If someone's doing

[13:30] $100 million a year in top line revenue and they're spitting out just a little bit of profit,

[13:36] that may be okay, right, if you do it 500,000 a year in profit, I knew a company that

[13:40] 20 million revenue, 500,000 a year in profit, they got sold for 168 million, right? Now that's a

[13:46] super valuable business and it's because the bankers and the people who bought it saw that they

[13:49] had reinvested everything, right, intergrowing the business. So understanding the relationship between

[13:55] these two things, if I have another business that's doing 500,000 a year and a million dollars a year

[13:59] in top line revenue, then it's going to be a far less valuable business. All right, so understanding

[14:03] that they might be making some strategic decisions about how they're reinvesting the business,

[14:06] et cetera, or some capital costs that might have cost them, but they see what it's going to

[14:09] yield them in the future, et cetera, all right. Now, this is especially true with software

[14:15] businesses, FYI, all right, which that particular business was a software business.

[14:19] Next one, survey says, yes, on net free cash flow, this is Uncle Warren, this is Uncle Charlie,

[14:25] Munger, this is their primary metric for measuring business, they try and figure out, what is the

[14:29] net free cash flow after I ingrearn best everything? This is an excellent way, excellent way,

[14:35] to figure out the value of the business, all right, because if you can do your net free cash flow

[14:40] and then you multiply it, then you're going to get very close to what an investor might be willing

[14:45] to pay for the asset, excluding some sort of crazy monopoly thing that they're trying to get

[14:49] with some sort of category-king situation in a marketplace. And then finally, net worth, how do we

[14:55] see this on the value of an entrepreneurs? Eggplant, right? Survey says, yes, I think this is an

[15:02] excellent measure of value, because this is what is left after all the chips, all the chips

[15:07] are full on all the cookies have crumbled, all the roosters have roosted, this is what's left after

[15:13] everything, right? Because if you, you know, like I've had 13 businesses and I now own eat more,

[15:18] so I've had 21 businesses, right? So I've had a lot of these things, and the thing that remains is you,

[15:24] you're a net worth as an entrepreneur. And if you look at the Fortune 500 and you look at

[15:27] 50 years ago, what you'll see is that there's only two businesses that are still on the Fortune

[15:32] 500 from now, from 50 years ago, G and Ford. That's it, that's it, right? And so when you think about

[15:38] that a lot of times what business becomes is, you create something and then as an entrepreneur,

[15:43] you want to be able to create enough personal wealth throughout the trajectory of the business. That's

[15:47] like literally all businesses, Fortune 500. And only two of them, right, are still there. And so

[15:54] thinking about that, that should hopefully shift your perspective, which is why I'm so big on,

[15:58] extracting dividends while the business is growing. And I know that that might not be as popular in

[16:02] the Silicon Valley world, but a lot of those guys don't live in reality. And for the everyday

[16:06] business owners, everyday entrepreneurs that are, you know, hustling out there, trying to make a

[16:10] buck, trying to feed their families, it's important to derisk because you can't put all your eggs

[16:14] in the single basket. That is my opinion. Sure, you can bet on yourself, but there are so many

[16:19] more stories of guys who bet everything on themselves at the casino and walk away empty handed.

[16:23] All right. And so it is my belief that if you were generating a profit, you should be purposely

[16:27] taking some out every month. Even though, like for me, the vast majority of my network is in my

[16:31] business valuations still, I still have, you know, over whatever, a lot. In, in, in, in, in

[16:37] investable assets that categorizes me as ultra high net worth. All right. And so again,

[16:42] ultra net worth just so you know, from the definition standpoint, is investable assets. It's not

[16:46] based on total value. These are the seven ways that I wanted to highlight from measuring value.

[16:50] If you see someone and they say, I am worth this or my businesses worth this, I built an

[16:55] X million dollar business. Ask these questions. Is that lifetime revenue? Is that contract value?

[17:02] That's been extrapolated? Is that your business valuation based on what multiple?

[17:06] Is that based on a top line multiple? Or is that based on a bottom line multiple? What's the

[17:10] net free cash flow? What are you taking out as dividends every year? And then finally,

[17:13] is someone will share it with you, which I, I'm actually not that opposed to sharing net worth numbers.

[17:18] I know some people are. I don't really know why I figure if you make enough money over time,

[17:22] people will always end up finding out which are net worth this, which is basically the entire

[17:25] Forbes list. And so anyways, these are the ways that you measure value. These are my two second

[17:30] snap judgments on them. And if you have, if you have your a suit cap on, then you probably

[17:34] figured out that a lot of these things go together. Right? It's not just one number. It's

[17:38] understanding the interplay between them so that you can ascertain with the true value of a business

[17:43] and or the entrepreneur that owns it is. So, hope you found valuable in that. Hope you found

[17:47] valuable in that. Hit the subscribe button. If you did and if you didn't, the don't have the

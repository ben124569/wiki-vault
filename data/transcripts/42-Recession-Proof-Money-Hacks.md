[00:00] 42 recession proved money secrets.

[00:02] And if you don't know my,

[00:03] my name is Oxermosi,

[00:04] I sold two of my companies last year for 46.2 million.

[00:06] And my current portfolio at Aclusor.com

[00:08] is over $200 million a year.

[00:09] And I want to say 10 years of money secrets

[00:11] that worked in most boom and bust economies

[00:15] so that you can save the decade and apply them today.

[00:17] Number one, he who gives the money has the power.

[00:21] So a lot of times for people,

[00:22] they're always trying to get money.

[00:23] I'm trying to get money.

[00:24] The person who gives the money is the one

[00:26] who's in control.

[00:27] Like if you think about the biggest institutions

[00:28] in the world, we're all like thanks.

[00:29] What did they do all day?

[00:30] They give money.

[00:31] When you give someone money,

[00:32] you get to dictate the terms.

[00:34] You actually now own them.

[00:36] Number two, never trade reputation for money

[00:38] because you can get money back,

[00:40] but you can't get reputation back.

[00:42] If you think about reputation

[00:43] or something that compounds over time,

[00:44] the longer you have it,

[00:45] the more you build it,

[00:46] the more compounds unto itself,

[00:48] it is your brand,

[00:49] which allows you to do more deals,

[00:50] do bigger deals, do them faster.

[00:52] The moment you lose the rap

[00:53] because you traded it for money in the short,

[00:55] you cut the compounding.

[00:56] And that's where all of the gains in life come from.

[00:58] Number three, money loves speed,

[01:00] wealth loves time, poverty loves indecision.

[01:04] Micro money loves speed.

[01:05] You wanna move quickly,

[01:06] spawn fast to customers, follow up with your leads, et cetera.

[01:09] But when you think about building wealth,

[01:10] it's not about transacting.

[01:11] It's about letting that compounding happen.

[01:13] And that takes time and it takes not interrupting.

[01:16] And most people never achieve either of those things

[01:18] because they sit in decision.

[01:19] For, we can always make more money than we need.

[01:23] This is a belief that has served my wife

[01:24] and I really, really well.

[01:25] We look back on our lives

[01:27] and we've never not been able to eat,

[01:28] not head shelter,

[01:29] and we've continued to increase our skill set.

[01:31] A lot of times we have this desire

[01:33] or our animal brain wants to make us

[01:35] make decisions out of scarcity, out of fear.

[01:37] We don't need any of the money that's coming

[01:39] because we have always had enough.

[01:41] Fortunes are made by taking a lot of risk

[01:45] with a little bit of money.

[01:46] Infortunes are maintained by taking a little bit of risk

[01:50] with a lot of money.

[01:51] Some of you self made had nothing.

[01:52] And so they risked everything in order to make it big.

[01:55] But the thing is, when you have nothing,

[01:56] you're not risking a lot,

[01:57] you have nothing to lose,

[01:58] which makes you dangerous,

[01:59] which is one of the biggest advantages of having nothing.

[02:01] But if you continue to do that,

[02:02] when you do have something to lose,

[02:04] you can lose your fortune

[02:05] and so you have to change the behavior

[02:07] once you have the cast once you have the empire.

[02:10] Six, money flows were attention goes.

[02:12] If you spend time thinking about fashion all day,

[02:14] your attention's going towards buying clothes.

[02:15] If you think about cars all day,

[02:16] it's going towards your car.

[02:17] If you think about your business all day,

[02:18] it should be going towards your business.

[02:19] Pick one thing, go all in.

[02:21] Because you only have so much to do with you.

[02:22] Think about it like a magnifying glass

[02:24] and you're the sun in this instant.

[02:26] And you've got to burn a hole to get through to the next level.

[02:29] If you're a spread across tooth in an area,

[02:32] you never get enough concentrated heat.

[02:34] Most people have the potential,

[02:36] but they don't have the focus,

[02:37] which is why they can never break through.

[02:38] Seven, your home life and your business life

[02:41] have to be aligned, money wise.

[02:43] So you can't try to grow a business

[02:45] and like reinvest everything here

[02:46] while you're living a super lavish lifestyle

[02:48] trying to flex.

[02:49] Like it has to be aligned.

[02:50] All of our business rules around money

[02:52] are also our home rules around money.

[02:54] And so if we don't live with any debt

[02:56] within our personal lives,

[02:57] we do the same thing within our business lives.

[02:59] Eight, ignore money advice from poor people.

[03:01] This may sound ridiculous, but let me say differently.

[03:04] Ignore money advice from your dad or mom

[03:07] who are poor than you want to be.

[03:08] From your good friends who are poor than you want to be.

[03:12] From people who have smaller dreams

[03:13] for your life than you do.

[03:15] The reason that rich people can lose everything

[03:17] and then recreate it is because they see reality more accurately.

[03:20] The reason people can't make money

[03:22] is because they don't see reality

[03:23] the way it actually is.

[03:24] Most of life is trying to pull these rocks out of our vision

[03:27] so that we can see more clearly.

[03:28] Nine, it's always easier to buy than to sell.

[03:30] You want to get into a stock,

[03:31] you want to get into something, you can buy it instantly.

[03:33] You want to get into a real estate deal,

[03:34] you want to get into a business,

[03:36] you have to be extra careful,

[03:37] you want to put all the slow on the buy,

[03:39] and you want to put all the lubricant on the sell.

[03:41] Ten, money is fickle, money is jealous.

[03:44] It sticks and goes through the person who pays it

[03:46] the most attention.

[03:47] Money comes into the system.

[03:48] But there are these grooves in the ground

[03:50] where it all eventually flows up

[03:52] to the few people who paid the most attention.

[03:54] Someone gets paid, they go by their groceries,

[03:56] they grocery person's to go by for the supplier,

[03:58] supplier by, for whatever,

[03:59] for the person who has the access

[04:01] is the one who pays it the most attention

[04:03] is the one who sticks to it the end.

[04:05] 11, we stay poor until we've learned

[04:07] all the lessons that poverty has to teach.

[04:09] People say in poverty,

[04:11] but they're not trying to pay attention

[04:12] to like what lesson do I need to be learning that I'm not?

[04:15] Actually taking action, learning how to save money

[04:17] at a basic level, personal finance.

[04:18] What's the big guys that's grainy here?

[04:20] The use of the lessons that we have to learn

[04:21] in poverty to get out of poverty.

[04:23] And until you do that, you don't beat the level.

[04:25] 12, forality drives innovation.

[04:27] Even when you have money,

[04:28] one of the best things to do in my opinion

[04:30] is constrain your resources, constrain time.

[04:33] It'll force you to think creatively to solve problems

[04:36] without using money as the solution.

[04:38] And if you have constraints right now on time and or money,

[04:41] don't see it as a disadvantage

[04:42] because it's what people who do have money

[04:44] try to get into to solve problems.

[04:46] And the only thing that's at this advantage

[04:47] is thinking of this.

[04:48] 13, think once before investing, think twice before spending.

[04:51] Investing is something that you were putting money into

[04:52] that is going to give you return of some kind.

[04:54] It's either going to give you a skill

[04:55] that's going to increase your earning capacity

[04:57] or it's going to be something that's going to quite literally

[04:58] give you a return in terms of it's going to be yield

[04:59] or worth more in the future.

[05:00] Spending is something that's going to never be worth more

[05:03] in the future and it's going to be consumed.

[05:04] 14, money flows to the person needs it the least.

[05:07] The rich get richer because they don't need it.

[05:08] And because they don't need it, they have leverage.

[05:10] You have to sell not from your own wallet

[05:12] or from the person in front of you.

[05:13] Come to the table with our other options.

[05:15] But it's the person you need's nothing

[05:17] who's the person who has the most power.

[05:18] And that's where the money will go.

[05:19] 15, we make money.

[05:21] Our money does not make us.

[05:22] You start tying your self worth to your network.

[05:24] Then your network itself becomes a liability

[05:26] to your own self esteem.

[05:28] It is my ability to make money, which is what creates my value.

[05:31] Not the money itself.

[05:33] Because the money itself can be taken.

[05:34] My family was in the Iranian Revolution

[05:36] and everything they had was taken.

[05:37] All it takes is one government saying,

[05:38] oh, all that land, all those cars, all those homes.

[05:41] Those are ours now.

[05:42] And that's it.

[05:43] And so a lot of people have this idea of legacy

[05:45] and permanence that's just an illusion,

[05:46] which is why we make our money or money doesn't make us.

[05:48] 16, it may be an amazing opportunity,

[05:51] but not our amazing opportunity.

[05:53] One of the things that I needed early on

[05:55] was permission to not do things.

[05:56] Because in the beginning, you don't know how to do anything.

[05:58] You're analysis paralysis and you just get scared

[06:00] and you're, once you get over that,

[06:01] the problem is that your yes muscle becomes too flexed.

[06:03] You start saying yes to everything.

[06:05] We should do this thing and we should do this thing together.

[06:06] You say, dude, I think it's amazing,

[06:07] I just don't think it's my amazing opportunity.

[06:09] And it's got me out of so many situations

[06:11] that I know long-term wouldn't have been good for me.

[06:13] 17, we control the money flow wherever possible.

[06:16] People who have a lot of control payment processors.

[06:18] Like everybody thinks they're amazing

[06:20] until the day you can't process money.

[06:21] And so the idea is the further upstream you can go,

[06:24] the more leverage and control you have over the money.

[06:26] Banks get the money and then they give it back later.

[06:28] The first is for the upstream the money,

[06:30] has the most power over it.

[06:32] 18, always have a no shit fund.

[06:33] Me knowing that I can take whatever risk I want

[06:36] and I have still protected

[06:38] and everything that I have for the rest of my life

[06:40] is taken care of.

[06:41] Give me a lot of peace, which allows me

[06:42] to be more aggressive, be more offensive.

[06:44] As soon as you can, have your no shit fund

[06:46] whether it's three months, whether it's six months,

[06:48] start putting that away that night

[06:50] so that you can go more on the offensive.

[06:52] 19, the biggest erotor of wealth is ignorance.

[06:56] Not knowing how to make a million dollars

[06:58] is costing you whatever you make every year

[06:59] of minus a million dollars.

[07:01] And so if you make 50 grand a year,

[07:02] it costs you $950,000 a year to not know

[07:04] how to make a million dollars,

[07:06] which is why I put so much money

[07:07] and to paying down this invisible hand

[07:09] that's been suppressing my income my whole life

[07:11] and yours too.

[07:12] 20, you get paid for the value create

[07:15] times your ability to negotiate

[07:16] divided by how hard you are to replace.

[07:18] If you provide something that's very valuable

[07:20] and you're very good at negotiating,

[07:21] but somebody else can provide the exact same thing as you.

[07:24] For a tenth of the price,

[07:25] you still don't have that good of negotiating position.

[07:27] Making money is capturing a percentage

[07:29] of the value that you create for other people.

[07:30] 21, mistakes love a rush decision.

[07:32] I've trained myself now enough

[07:33] that like when I feel foam, I pause.

[07:36] Fomo means slow go.

[07:39] Mistakes love a rush decision.

[07:40] And so it's just one of those easy beliefs

[07:42] that has slowed me down and has saved me

[07:44] so much money.

[07:46] 22, leverage comes from not needing the other person

[07:49] and more specifically, leverage comes from needing nothing.

[07:51] You can't control somebody who needs nothing.

[07:55] Right?

[07:55] Someone needs nothing.

[07:56] You have no influence over them.

[07:58] How do I become that person?

[07:59] The monks do it by relinquishing everything

[08:00] and needing nothing.

[08:01] And the rich man does it by satisfying all of his needs

[08:04] and not needing the deal and the other side of the table.

[08:06] In both of the situations you create leverage.

[08:08] 23, markets take longer to adjust than you expect

[08:12] and then they move faster than you can imagine.

[08:14] The big short, if you saw that movie.

[08:15] The guy was shorting for like four years

[08:17] and he's like, the man doesn't make sense.

[08:19] The bubble kept going, bubble kept going, bubble kept going,

[08:21] and then it happened faster than people imagined.

[08:25] We have to be comforted with the fact

[08:26] that we might have to sit in this comfort

[08:28] for an extended period of time

[08:29] before what we believe to be reality is reflected.

[08:32] 24, money is a game treated as such.

[08:34] You can't win the game if you don't know your playing one.

[08:37] The wealthiest people in the world see money as a game.

[08:40] They don't even use money to satisfy material needs

[08:42] because they already have it.

[08:43] How can I adopt that perspective early around in my career?

[08:46] Thinking about things in terms of personal bests,

[08:49] bank account PRs.

[08:50] Look, it's measured, it gets improved.

[08:51] You can get someone to lose weight

[08:53] just by simply getting them to weigh themselves everyday

[08:55] without giving them any advice at all

[08:56] so if you pay attention to it, it will start sticking to you.

[08:59] 25, don't bet the empire for a pot of gold.

[09:01] Even though you might have this opportunity to hear,

[09:03] it's never worth risking the whole pie

[09:05] and I can't tell you the amount of times

[09:06] that I'm in like, man, if I went all in on this thing,

[09:09] money wise.

[09:10] So the thing is that you can go all in on your attention,

[09:11] but I wouldn't go all in on your money.

[09:13] 26, always do a starter deal with new faces.

[09:15] So this is a hard one.

[09:16] One of your friends comes to you and it's like,

[09:18] dude, I wanna do this Airbnb thing.

[09:19] Hey, I've got this to do a starter deal first.

[09:21] You gotta see how these people are.

[09:22] Everything's just still a great on paper.

[09:24] Everything's just still makes sense.

[09:25] They should still be amazing characters,

[09:26] et cetera.

[09:27] You still mitigate it with respect to saying,

[09:29] first deal, I'm gonna do with you as a small deal.

[09:31] 27, trust is worth more than a bigger return.

[09:34] Trust lubricates deal velocity, trust compounds.

[09:37] You don't wanna take all the meat on the bone

[09:39] because you wanna have a long-term relationship.

[09:41] When I talk to partners, when I talk to business owners,

[09:44] how they talk about the people that they do business with,

[09:46] tells you a lot about them and how they do business.

[09:48] When I talk to somebody in a mic,

[09:49] hey, why don't you do this to like,

[09:50] hey, these guys have been good to us for a very long time.

[09:53] We've had a very good relationship for 10 years.

[09:54] That is something I respect a lot.

[09:56] And that is what people who have money act like.

[09:58] Poor people are always trying to one over everyone,

[10:01] over and over again, and they never get any trust

[10:03] from anybody which means they have no compounding relationships.

[10:06] 28, money is not a zero-sum game.

[10:08] The older I've gotten the more I'm like,

[10:09] how can I get onto their side of the table

[10:11] and both make money together?

[10:12] Why don't we both take a big piece of this upside

[10:15] rather than slice up a pie that's in front of us?

[10:18] 29, never take a standard deal.

[10:19] There's always a better one.

[10:20] There's always a better deal.

[10:21] And a lot of times you should have to ask for it.

[10:23] Okay, this term and this term and this term

[10:25] are things that are concerning to me

[10:26] is there anything we can do about these.

[10:27] Remember earlier, leverage comes from not needing the deal.

[10:29] You have to be willing to walk away.

[10:30] And I can't tell you the amount of times

[10:32] that I've walked away from a deal.

[10:34] And the person comes back after saying,

[10:35] why can't you do a deal?

[10:36] I'm like, cool, no worries.

[10:37] And they come back through a four-day later,

[10:38] and they're like, I'm at, I'll do the deal.

[10:40] And then I might be like, hey, well, the terms have changed.

[10:42] You know, I'm kidding.

[10:43] 30, expect low risk, amazing returns.

[10:46] The wealthiest friends that I have who are billionaire plus,

[10:48] they're just not interested in 10, 20% returns.

[10:52] They're looking for 50% plus,

[10:55] annualized returns.

[10:56] Most people expect 10% because that's what the S&P does.

[10:58] It doesn't mean that that has to be your personal standard.

[11:00] Thinking through that way has changed

[11:02] how I saw investing in general.

[11:03] 31, don't think in IRR, which means internal rate of return.

[11:07] Instead, think in how long will this take to double?

[11:09] How long will this take to triple?

[11:11] It's hard to say this is gonna grow by 25% a year.

[11:13] What is easier to say is this is gonna double in three.

[11:17] Changing how you ask the question,

[11:19] changes how you'll find the answer.

[11:20] 32, this is a buffettism,

[11:22] but diversification is a hedge against ignorance.

[11:24] And it's only risky if you don't know what you're doing.

[11:26] There's a million games and all of them make tons of money.

[11:29] And so it's really about taking one game

[11:31] and taking it to its natural conclusion,

[11:33] which is learning every single aspect of that game.

[11:35] Rather than saying, I wanna be in stocks,

[11:37] I wanna be in real estate, I wanna be in crypto.

[11:38] I wanna also have my side hustles, I wanna have,

[11:40] like you can't get good at any of them

[11:41] because your competing against people who are all in.

[11:44] Play one game and play well.

[11:45] 34, I skip 33 because I covered it in that last month.

[11:48] Returns are in the terms.

[11:50] Everybody who's watching this,

[11:51] if you make money doing anything that the side is all,

[11:53] I'll pay you billion dollars for your business,

[11:55] but it's on my terms.

[11:56] And I could make that deal every time

[11:57] and not lose money.

[11:58] Understanding the terms of the agreement

[11:59] and how many different ways you can make terms.

[12:01] And the only way you do that is through having the conversations

[12:04] and trying to structure it from learning from other people.

[12:05] 35, whenever possible, use house money.

[12:08] If you have the opportunity to recoup your principle

[12:10] and still have money in the game, do that.

[12:13] Then you can get super aggressive

[12:14] with the investments and things like that

[12:15] that you're making, but you're doing it on a house money.

[12:17] You're doing it with no chance of losing principle.

[12:19] 36, always know how to get your money back.

[12:21] You have to know the exact way of doing it.

[12:23] Not just like, oh yeah, I can get my money back.

[12:25] Just like no, but how would I do it?

[12:27] Walk me through each of the steps

[12:29] so that I have full understanding

[12:30] of how this would work.

[12:31] If they actually don't mean it,

[12:32] then they won't have a way to do it,

[12:33] and you'll be able to stiff something on a media.

[12:35] 37, cash flow is king.

[12:37] All right, and that's both on a personal level

[12:39] and on a business level.

[12:40] So for you, your cash flows

[12:41] can be dictated by your income money, your expenses.

[12:44] It's really your savings flow.

[12:45] If there's one thing that you get from money rules

[12:47] is that you be switching your metric

[12:49] towards what am I saving every month

[12:51] rather than what am I making every month?

[12:53] 38, buy for forever.

[12:54] This is a Warren Buffett and Charlie Mungerism.

[12:56] Charlie says, the money is it made in the buy or the sell.

[12:59] It's made in the wait.

[13:00] If you could never sell anything you buy

[13:02] when you are buying, you could never get out of it,

[13:04] then you buy differently, and you buy super long.

[13:07] And then ultimately, that's what does it interrupt

[13:09] the compounding process, and that's what unlocks

[13:11] huge wealth later.

[13:13] 39, you heard me say it earlier,

[13:14] but fo-mo means go slow.

[13:16] You feel fo-mo, it means slow doubt.

[13:17] It means take a second, give a breather,

[13:19] put some space between you and the decision,

[13:20] and the only reason you feel fo-mo

[13:22] is because your time rises to short.

[13:23] 40, if you can't afford to lose the money,

[13:25] then don't use the money.

[13:27] If you're like, this is my last dollar,

[13:28] then it's probably not a good idea to risk it, right?

[13:32] Which is why we always have the O-shit fund.

[13:33] 41, peace of mind can be bought

[13:36] and it can be sold.

[13:37] If there are situations where you're like,

[13:39] man, this is gonna keep me up at night, don't do it.

[13:41] Peace of mind can very much be bought and sold,

[13:43] and I can tell you make much better decisions

[13:44] when you've got it.

[13:45] 42, and final.

[13:47] A lot of people think about diversification

[13:48] in terms of industry,

[13:49] but they don't think about it in terms of capital stack.

[13:51] A bank, for example, is at the top,

[13:53] it's a preferred creditor.

[13:54] There's a reason a lot of banks don't lose money,

[13:55] and it's because they're the first creditor.

[13:56] So you can think about diversification

[13:57] between like stocks, crypto, businesses, whatever.

[14:00] You can also think about it vertically

[14:01] in terms of where am I sitting on the stack.

[14:03] If you think about those in terms of both types

[14:05] of diversification, when the tide goes out,

[14:07] you're the one who gets your money back first.

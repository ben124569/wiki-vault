[00:00] So if you have trouble being productive and I would consider entering a season of no one,

[00:04] Warren Buffett once said, the difference between successful people and really successful people

[00:09] is that really successful people say no to almost everything.

[00:12] When I look at the periods of my life in business where I've had huge amounts of growth

[00:16] and very short periods of time, I've gone through things that I call the season of no.

[00:20] And a season of no isn't forever that's just for now.

[00:23] And sometimes seasons can be three months, sometimes seasons can be three years.

[00:26] The longest season of no that I had was a three-year season.

[00:29] During that season of no, I said no to friends.

[00:32] I was a little bit extreme, but I also was running from absolute poverty and I had started seeing

[00:37] some success and I was so afraid of messing it up that I said no to alcohol.

[00:42] So I stopped drinking entirely.

[00:43] I stopped saying yes to any social events.

[00:45] I was in a paid group that was paying like $35,000 a year to be in.

[00:50] And I didn't go to any of the events for two years, even though I paid for it.

[00:54] A lot of people think it hurts to say notice things.

[00:56] So it does because you feel like you're rejecting other people and most of us have been on the

[00:59] other side of that and feeling rejected sucks.

[01:01] You have to kind of trick your brain into thinking that the no is actually a yes to the thing that

[01:06] matters most.

[01:06] Because the way that I've always thought about this was from my first principles perspective of,

[01:10] if I achieve this really big thing in three years or five years, all of these doors will be

[01:15] open for me.

[01:16] But if I allow these ones to choose you one-off conversations, one-off favors, one-off things,

[01:20] to take me away from that one big thing, I know that five years are now,

[01:25] me not having the thing, makes it far less likely that even those first doors are still open.

[01:29] They're only reaching out to me now because of the little bit of success that I've experienced,

[01:33] which I got here because of being focused on the one thing that mattered most.

[01:37] Jim launch in the big $50 million dollar whatever exit was built during a season of no.

[01:41] And all the people that I said no to still hit me up.

[01:45] But if I hadn't built that during a season of no and I had said yes to all these little things and I

[01:50] said no to the thing that mattered most, they might not be here still hitting me up.

[01:54] There's two scenarios that I play out in my head. One is that at the end of this, where you achieve

[01:58] something, 95% of people are going to be even further behind you. And so you'll still have access to them.

[02:04] The people who were on part with you shoulder to shoulder, always mutual respect, you still also have

[02:09] access to them. If for some reason, someone is offended that you said no to them earlier on,

[02:15] guess what? There are other people that in this future state will walk into your life.

[02:20] And so there's a lot of noes that I made early on that I can't even remember the door that

[02:23] probably permanently shot because I have so many other doors that have opened for me. I like to think of

[02:28] yeses that I'm to give to other people as withdraws from my personal energy account. And I think of noes

[02:35] as deposits into my gold account. Here's how I'm going above it, told people to make goals.

[02:41] He said right down your 25 top goals in life. He said really think about it, make them in order,

[02:46] 1 to 25. Then circle the top five, tear off everything underneath and throw it away.

[02:51] Because there's the only thing that matters. During a season of noes, I put all of my effort into

[02:55] the one goal of those five that matters to most of me. And I write down what is the minimum

[02:59] that I have to do to not move backwards in these ones. Kind of like bodybuilding. You usually can only

[03:05] work on one week instead of time. Steve Jobs said, people think focus means saying yes to the

[03:10] thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means seeing no to a hundred

[03:14] other good ideas that are out there. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the

[03:18] things we haven't done as the things I have done. When you think about focusing, right? You think

[03:22] what's focusing is saying yes. No. Focusing is about saying no. Innovation is saying no to a

[03:29] thousand other good ideas. There's the opportunistic yeses and noes that we have to make. So the

[03:35] better and better your business gets, the more attractive the opportunities that will present

[03:39] themselves. And so you may have this marketing agency, for example, and it's doing well.

[03:44] But then all of a sudden one of your clients is like, hey man, how about I give you equity in my

[03:46] business and you keep doing the marketing for me? And then you start thinking yourself like,

[03:50] well yeah, because I'm going to make more on this. Steve, I should do this deal. The thing is

[03:53] there's so much inefficiency in this one off or one's you choose your relationship that you lose

[03:58] on the main thing. If you build this massive agency, that's the thing that everyone's going to

[04:02] come to you for. If you have this weird thing with two or three odd appendages from these one

[04:07] off deals, I'll tell you as an investor when I see that I see an undisciplined entrepreneur. I see someone

[04:12] who cannot focus on the thing that matters most. And that's why when we talk about leverage in

[04:16] terms of getting more for what you put in, that's why being so selective on the one thing that

[04:20] matters most is so important because most people don't achieve the success they want because

[04:24] they either don't do the thing that matters most enough times. They don't do it for long enough.

[04:28] Or they're doing the wrong thing altogether. Most plans take into their natural end are actually

[04:32] pretty good. So even if you had a local business that was a dry cleaning business, if you did it

[04:36] for 40 years and never got distracted, I promise you that one you have a pretty good dry cleaning

[04:40] business too. You probably have multiple locations and three might have been able to scale nationwide.

[04:44] I was in the gym space for a decade. So I could have gone into probably having a hundred locations

[04:48] of my own. Or doing the franchise route. I went the licensing route. But just staying in that game

[04:53] for a decade straight without doing anything else. And when I did do something else, which is why

[04:58] I make these videos because it was one of my bigger mistakes. I started the supplement company and

[05:02] I probably shouldn't have done that. I probably should have kept doing the main thing. There's also

[05:05] the know of doing work that's below your pay grade. That's actually happening with the portfolio

[05:09] I come to recently. They have access cash flow. They're making profit every month. But the CEO in the

[05:14] short term didn't want their cash flow to go down. There was this clear role that he was spending

[05:18] 10 to 15 hours a week on it. Like do that's two full days of your work week. But he didn't want

[05:23] to give it to somebody else because it wasn't 40 hours of his week. Do you not think that in the

[05:27] two full other days you can make up for the work that you shouldn't be doing that somebody else can

[05:32] do? And realistically they'll do it better than you because they're actually fully focused on it

[05:35] rather than trying to get it done. You have to say no and this is going to be a controversial one

[05:39] to family obligations. We even say the word family obligation as though it's assumed and expected.

[05:46] It's a choice. It's a family choice. I'm not saying don't talk to your family. I'm saying you might not

[05:51] want to talk to your mom every day. What you really have is a family trade off. You're going to

[05:56] trade getting a one off comment or a sting guy. Do you think you're too good for us now or Mr.

[06:01] Bigshot comment for the one thing that matters most? If you can't talk to me your father. You got all the

[06:08] money but you know what you don't have. You don't have no heart. You ain't got too balls. You have to let

[06:13] other people's dream of you die so that your dream can live because there's only so much of you to go

[06:19] around. Everybody else is trying to get you to be the version of you that best serves them,

[06:23] including your family. I don't think it's a malicious intention but they have goals for you

[06:27] that are probably not your goals for you and somebody's goals have to die and where most of them die

[06:32] is right in the middle which is you try and do theirs and you try and do yours and you actually

[06:36] accomplish neither. So you might as well do 100% yours, do none of theirs and then actually achieve

[06:42] the long-term goal which they probably have is that you live a happy and successful one. You only

[06:46] get there by saying no in the short term to get the long yes. This is a big one. This is business

[06:52] contacts and this is one of the hardest ones to say no to. So you hop on the call, you hop on the

[06:57] zone call, you take the hay, you got a second, you got 15. I'll show you literally I looked at my

[07:01] inbox and we'll tell you the actual words what it sounds like. Hey I wanted to touch base real quick

[07:05] about something. Hey I've got this opportunity I think you're going to want to take a look at.

[07:08] Let's catch up it's been a minute. It's not the 10 minutes they're stealing from me. It's the

[07:13] time that I'm thinking about what I'm going to say before I get on the call. It's what I'm thinking

[07:17] about after the call. It's the one I wake up the next morning and I'm still thinking about someone

[07:21] else's business rather than my own. And it's the actual cost of switching. They've done a

[07:25] re-sert on this but basically you are like four times more productive per unit of time if you do one

[07:31] task rather than trying to go A and B. And they just did it between two tasks just asking people

[07:36] to go switch between task A and then do task B and they were different tasks. And it took people

[07:41] four times as long versus just doing A and then B. So when people interrupt your day think about it

[07:47] as they just four acts how much longer it's going to take me to get this thing done. That's the real

[07:51] cost of saying yes to them. Now in the beginning if you want to hop on calls with people because you

[07:56] want to provide value to them, by all means do it but you're being conscious about it. So if you have

[08:01] trouble being productive or getting the things that you want done or achieving the big goal then

[08:06] I would consider entering a season of now. There was a season where I was going from six locations to

[08:10] 10. Now I ultimately talked to a mentor decided to sell my locations, turn into license and I was like

[08:16] shit sucks right now. I was like I'm working 80 hours, 100 hours a week, every hour of every day.

[08:21] I gave up football. I gave up Netflix and what I started doing is writing down the things that I was

[08:25] willing to sacrifice for my goal rather than things that I was willing to do. So a lot of times people

[08:29] have these really big to do lists but what I don't think people do is make really big to don't list.

[08:33] Everybody the head of you has the same time. So if you're working all day and you're not making

[08:38] progress as fast as you want it means the people ahead of you it's not that they're doing things you

[08:42] aren't is that you're doing things they are. They're choosing to say no to more activities than you are.

[08:46] And if you say no to everything else what's left is the work in front of you that just needs doing.

[08:51] Jerry Feinfield talked about how he wrote comedy. He never forced himself to write but he said during

[08:56] the time block he wasn't allowed to do anything else but write. He said I could sit there

[09:00] bored but I couldn't do anything else except for write. It's a long time to spend on something that

[09:06] means absolutely nothing but that's what I do that's what people want me to do. It's spend a lot of time

[09:13] wastefully so that then I can then waste their time. People aren't willing to sit for that two or

[09:19] three minutes and they allow themselves to get distracted and so I think one of the easiest ways to be

[09:23] really productive is just allow no space for anything else to occur and then what happens by default

[09:29] is to become productive because you have nothing else to do. When I need to change a behavior I try

[09:33] and change the environment rather than changing myself because it's way easier to change everything else than

[09:37] a change you.

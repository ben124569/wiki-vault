[00:00] I'm going to share with you my plan to get to a billion dollars a year in revenue and I'm going to answer the number one question that I get most frequently

[00:07] Which is why we don't sell courses and why give our stuff away for free

[00:11] Without further ado, let's rock and roll. So up my name is auction mozi for those of you who are new to the channel

[00:15] I went acquisition.com. It's a portfolio of companies that does about 85 million dollars a year in revenue and

[00:20] The reason for that is because those companies pay for all this stuff that I have already and I don't think selling a thousand more courses really

[00:26] gonna be that meaningful to me. So that being said

[00:29] The exciting news is why we are doing this and what you have to gain from it in growing acquisition.com

[00:35] The portfolio companies we've acquired a lot of skills along the way

[00:38] So how to create offers how to generate leads how to monetize your acquisition so you can get customers for free

[00:43] How to sell how to scale sales teams how to increase lifetime gross profit per customer how to price adequately

[00:48] Like the beliefs around it how to exit the business all of these different things at this point

[00:52] We've already sold seven businesses in my career. We have six I think right now in our portfolio companies

[00:58] We continue to want to acquire more and so my entire thesis behind acquisition.com and

[01:04] States union because you're gonna like the thing that I'm gonna leave you at the end

[01:06] It's gonna be sick and it's gonna be worth more than a lot of stuff you don't need a net the reason that I do acquisition

[01:10] Not come the thesis behind it is that I believe the education system is broken and many of you

[01:14] Probably agree with me right who wants to pay 50,000

[01:16] 100,000, 200,000 dollars a year right for an education that adds zero value if you can get the same job at the same

[01:22] Pay before you go in as you can get after you go to college then what's the point right and not only that

[01:28] Because it's government subsidized they don't let you get out of the debt which is insane to me in what world

[01:33] Would you give an 18 year old 200,000 dollars they can never get out of right?

[01:37] It's like making an irreversible decision and and they do that because they settle you with debt and they take 35% of your paycheck for the rest of your life

[01:44] And you don't know that they're doing it through interest all right anyways that being said

[01:49] Enter acquisition.com the reason I believe that this explosion of the gear-respaces happened over the last 10

[01:55] 15 years is because the demand for high value skills has not changed

[02:00] People want to work by and large people want to provide value people want to be good at

[02:05] Something and exchange their time and effort and knowledge for money, right?

[02:09] The thing is is they're not getting the skills and so they continue to seek and then man is there

[02:14] It is just un-satisfied and so because of technology, right because of the changes in the world

[02:20] Technology I'll quote in a Val-Ravaconx I like this quote a lot

[02:22] Technology democratizes consumption and consolidates production and what that means is if you're the best in the world

[02:29] You get to do it for everyone and so my

[02:32] thesis or an acquisition.com is that education will become increasingly fragmented meaning rather than one big

[02:38] Glock of general education people are gonna get more and more niche down in the types of education that they learn

[02:43] The learn how to become hairdressers the learn had become plumbers the learn how to run gyms the learn how to be online trainers

[02:49] The learn how to be life coaches the learn how to do what ever you know

[02:51] Fix ATM machines whatever it is there are skills that are niche and a more high value that they can exchange the marketplace

[02:57] For money and they can feed themselves and so my goal with acquisition.com is to give the thing that I have that is more valuable than money

[03:04] For those of you who do fall or channel my wife and I donate about a million dollars a year right now

[03:08] I've a personal income and we've already signed away our wells that we will be donating

[03:12] The vast majority of our of our dollars two charities upon our death the thing is is that as much as I I can give money

[03:18] The thing that I can give at far more leverage and at far more scale is the skills that we have acquired in order to create that money

[03:24] And I can do that at zero cost and so that is the thesis behind this is that I want to take all the skills that I have and transfer them to everyone else and

[03:32] The idea here is that I can help as many people get to

[03:35] 1 million three million five million dollars a year and then maybe some day if it's awesome

[03:41] If you're at five or ten or 15 or 20 and you'd like to get to 50 million you'd like to get to a hundred million

[03:45] You'll allow us to to help and and invest in your business so we can do it together

[03:49] Otherwise everything we have is free and today marks a very important announcement that I have for everyone on the channel

[03:56] Most of you nation love you all and it's for you guys the first of ten different courses at least that this point

[04:01] I have ten that are outlined that I will be releasing with books and

[04:05] Audio books and downloads to go with it. So the first is

[04:09] 100 million our offers this is a book you can get on Amazon for 99 cents go grab it if you want the hard copy

[04:14] I think it's this is like 20 bucks

[04:16] But it's full-color full print and that I make I think a dollar on this. All right, and I donate all the stuff that charity anyways

[04:21] So you can get that and then on the site

[04:24] You can get the downloads and all that stuff you don't have to opt in anything you can just click and download it has all the checklist all the

[04:29] S.A.P.s.s everything that we do to actually do this with our businesses all right

[04:33] You can just have them and then we will be releasing all of the videos that you can find on the site

[04:38] You'll also find them here on YouTube as one playlist

[04:40] All right, so you can watch them uninterrupted no purchase necessary nothing and this is why I do this for free is because candidly

[04:48] I have gotten to a point where money only solves money problems and I have solved all of my money problems and what remain our problems that money can't solve and so

[05:01] In an attempt to solve the problems that money can't solve

[05:04] Which for me are meaning meaning in life if I know that I'm gonna be giving away everything that I have when I die

[05:10] It sounds silly to not enjoy that giving process while I'm alive and

[05:15] To give the thing that is more valuable the most valuable thing that I have which are the skills and the beliefs that I've acquired that have gotten us here

[05:21] Which I believe that anyone can acquire those skills the streets and beliefs if they want to and so

[05:28] I want to make that available to everyone and anyone who has that desire and so that is

[05:34] The reason that I wrote the book that is the reason that we have the courses and that is the reason that I will continue to do this because I

[05:42] Really like it and so

[05:45] Love you all I am your number one fan. I'm rooting for you more than you can imagine and because I know that when I die

[05:52] Eventually on a long enough time horizon all of the money and wealth that our companies will amass

[05:57] We'll eventually get scattered to the wind and the legacy that I will leave will eventually be forgotten

[06:02] And so I might as well enjoy the ride with you all that stuff. It will now be live

[06:06] I'll keep you guys posted as we as released new courses and books

[06:11] Please don't ask when they're coming out the the limit test for when I will release it is when it is good enough to be better than the thing that you just had

[06:17] And so I always want to make it better and better and better and the difference between good and great is vast and the difference

[06:23] vast sorry the difference between great and exceptional or remarkable is even wider and

[06:29] It takes time to have several coats of paints on work and let it sit and let it marinate and let it simplify and to still

[06:35] So that I can try and transfer the knowledge as quickly and as seamlessly from me to you as possible in a way that is not boring as hell

[06:43] And so that's my goal all right and so at this point

[06:47] The courses that will be coming out are first the one that is now live is the $100 off first course

[06:53] How to make offers so good people feel stupid saying no so right now if you struggle to sell you struggle to get lead things like that

[06:59] It's because usually your offer is poor right?

[07:01] So if you're not good at sales, a lot of times the thing that you're actually selling people don't want and there's ways to structure the offer

[07:06] So way more people will buy it all right

[07:07] This is one of the cornerstone pillars and I had some of the other courses already outlined in written

[07:12] But I realized I had to do this first all right

[07:14] So I'm teaching these courses in sequence for how you would do it to improve and build your business the second course and book

[07:19] We'll be around lead generation so once you have the offer the thing that you're going to sell that people want

[07:23] It's how do I get more leads?

[07:24] All right, so show you the ways that we get leads in all the companies across all different channels and the process that we follow to do that

[07:30] The next one after that will be called money models all right, so it's how you can grow without outside capital

[07:35] All right, so we've been able to grow each of these businesses that we have without any outside capital because we use a process called client-finish acquisition

[07:41] Which basically means that we use the money from the marketplace to fund our own growth

[07:46] So we have a negative acquisition cost it means it costs us less money to get a customer than it cut then we make in

[07:51] Getting it all right, and we can collect more than that in 30 days of cash

[07:54] So we can continue to reinvest in acquisition so the acquisition is no longer a bottleneck

[07:58] Which leads us naturally the next thing which is sales so I'll show you how to script the sales process

[08:02] Chorgraph the process and the words and all that kind of stuff that'll be the next book

[08:05] All right the book after that be scaling sales teams all right because that's a whole other skill

[08:10] Is scaling the actual team and recruiting and compensation and management and training all that stuff and that's what really builds big enterprises

[08:17] After that we'll go into

[08:19] Pricing and increasing lifetime growth profit per customer

[08:21] So how do you actually do that in a way that is operationally efficient?

[08:24] All right, and so we've done this in a lot of companies. It's one of the things that we do very well

[08:27] Because the back end ultimately informs the front and the more money you make per customer the more that you can ultimately

[08:32] Spend on acquisition and then scale the company as a result of that and at the end of the day

[08:35] The product is always gonna be the number one thing that ultimately would determine the success of the company

[08:41] People think it's about the marketing if you want to if you want to make a little bit of money sure

[08:44] Learn how to promote learn how to market like I mean anyone can sell anything to somebody once right

[08:48] But the guys you build fortunes learn how that once they make a sale

[08:52] They make a sale to get a customer

[08:54] They don't get customers to make sales think about that for a second

[08:57] You make a sale to create the relationship of a customer that then buys again and again and again and again

[09:03] But till the trust and the value that you've provided in access of the price that they paid

[09:07] Right people pay right for the discrepancy between with it pay and what they get right that is the value

[09:13] That is the customer surplus that is where they feel like they got a good deal

[09:18] And so a good deal has nothing to do with the price

[09:21] But everything to do with the value and so my goal here with everything that I have is that I'm pricing this at zero

[09:26] So that hopefully you get the most value you're humanly possible and so anyways, most ination. I do this stuff for you guys

[09:31] I do this because

[09:33] Kind of Lee I enjoy it. I had an executive coach a while back when I was kind of feeling like I didn't have any meaning

[09:38] There was just lots of money that was plowing in every week

[09:41] And I was like I don't know what I want to do and she was like what do you enjoy doing?

[09:44] I was like why enjoy reading I enjoy writing and I enjoy

[09:48] Transfring the skills that I have to other people and I like drawing the frameworks out so that I learn in teaching

[09:53] She was like well, how can you design?

[09:56] You know a life around that and so I went to work and that was about a year and a half ago

[10:03] Was where the kind of the idea for acquisition.com started and I was like I want to help entrepreneurs in general

[10:08] And I want to do in a way that no one else is doing it so that is

[10:12] That's why I'm doing this and so yeah my goal is that if you're if you're if you're new entrepreneur

[10:18] You're you know trying to make your first dollar first million or fifth million whatever it is

[10:22] That we can help you along the way and long-term if you ever want us to invest in your business

[10:27] If you cross the five million ish threshold your five or ten or fifteen and you like to get to thirty or fifty or hundred

[10:33] Then you'll allow us that that fun opportunity with you, but otherwise

[10:37] Everything we have is free most in action keeping awesome and I'll see you guys in the videos

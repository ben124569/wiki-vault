## Full Transcript
[00:00] A hundred days ago, I made an investment that pays me $3,300 per day in profit off of a single

[00:05] deal that was struck.

[00:07] And I told you about this at the beginning of the deal, what was going to happen, and so

[00:11] I wanted to do this as part 2 of what actually happened in actuality.

[00:17] For this, you don't owe me money to talk to me as a mozi, I own acquisition.com.

[00:19] It's a portfolio of companies that says about $85 million a year.

[00:22] The reason for this channel is because I know a lot of people are broke, and I don't want

[00:24] you to be one of them.

[00:25] So, one of the things that I like a lot is hard money lending.

[00:28] A big fan of it, it's private lending, which is basically like you are the bank.

[00:32] The reason I like this is because you can determine the deal structure, which means

[00:35] that you can create the upside and the downside, and then it's up to the other party

[00:39] of whether or not they want to accept that.

[00:42] That's valuable because if you can control a lot of the variables and you can mitigate

[00:46] downside risk, which if you've hurt any of my stuff, the ultra wealthy out there, it's not

[00:50] about trying to hit their upside, like everybody who's poor buys lottery tickets, because

[00:54] they only think about upside, but they don't think about downside.

[00:56] Nobody even's rich who doesn't do that because they understand downside risk and how

[01:00] getting rich is about really just making fewer mistakes and letting time become an ally

[01:05] rather than a liability.

[01:06] Using time as an asset rather than something that is working against you.

[01:09] What I'm going to do is I'm going to outline the deal structure of what we agreed on, and

[01:13] then what happened, and then there was one really curious thing that happened that was actually

[01:17] awesome, and I think it was probably the biggest takeaway for me and hopefully for you in

[01:21] this process.

[01:22] Big picture here.

[01:23] This was a $2.5 million note.

[01:26] So I wired $2.5 million in cash to a buyer.

[01:29] The buyer went to buy a building out of four closure.

[01:35] They had a $334 unit, which if you're like holy cow, how is it $334 unit building to

[01:41] an half a million, hence the reason I was happy to do the deal.

[01:44] It was also in a war zone, like the police officers who don't even go here.

[01:47] This is a deal in Memphis.

[01:49] It's $34 unit building.

[01:52] It was basically condemned.

[01:53] The two of them were squatters, drug dealers, all sorts of stuff.

[01:56] Here are the risk factors, which is, what if I don't get the money back, which means

[02:01] that I would have a building, and then how can I make sure that I get the money back?

[02:05] The first layer of defense here is guarantees.

[02:08] Both of the buyers is two people.

[02:11] Personally guaranteed the money, and they had net worths in access of two and a half million.

[02:16] We had that going for us times two.

[02:19] Next, the building itself, we have the value, which the question is, well, if it was condemned

[02:25] and all that kind of stuff, do we know what the value is?

[02:28] Is it really worth two and a half million dollars?

[02:30] Would you ever be able to sell it?

[02:31] Good question.

[02:32] So we had three offers already on the building for between five million and five point

[02:40] six million.

[02:41] So an offer is one thing, but is there another level we can have?

[02:45] There was actually somebody put earnest money down, meaning that they had made the offer,

[02:49] and it was accepted and they were one put money in the deal.

[02:51] So there's earnest money of 300K.

[02:53] So they had said, we want to buy it, it was the use guys, the 5.6 guys, right?

[02:56] earnest money of 300,000 in the deal, saying that as soon as you guys can transfer the title

[03:00] over to us, then great.

[03:01] And the last thing was, was to make sure that we were actually in the sounds minor, but this

[03:05] is how a lot of deals get messed up, that we were actually on the title, right?

[03:08] So that means that if for some reason we do not get paid, we are the first, you know,

[03:15] the first people who have ownership or entitlement, rather, you know, entitled to the property.

[03:21] All right?

[03:22] So that there's no other leans against the property that we are the only ones who are

[03:26] going to be receiving the property if something went into full, right?

[03:29] And so our cash was used to pay off the last person who had a lean on the home.

[03:33] So on the homes of the building, and then we took over that position as preferred.

[03:37] And so this was kind of the deal structure, all right?

[03:39] Now this is how we got paid, all right?

[03:41] So these are the payment terms.

[03:42] So it was 4% per month, all right?

[03:46] Now 4% times 2.5 million, if you're curious, right?

[03:49] To do is $100,000 per month, all right?

[03:54] So I was making $100,000 per month, for the last three and a half months, for them to hold

[03:59] this money.

[04:00] Now, after the fourth month, so for some reason, they hadn't done this deal in four months,

[04:04] which it was supposed to be done in 60 days, which it wasn't.

[04:06] So I'll talk about that in a second, right?

[04:08] So if it was done in, if it took four plus months, the interest rate would double, all

[04:15] right?

[04:16] So then it would go to $200,000 per month, all right?

[04:18] Because then it starts to reflect that there might be more risk here, right?

[04:21] So I need to start getting compensated more for this.

[04:23] All right?

[04:24] On top of that, we did was a two month minimum carry, which basically just means that even

[04:29] if they do the deal in 20 seconds, I still get two months of carry, which means minimum

[04:32] of 200 k, I'm going to get back for just risking the two and a half million, which means

[04:36] I'm getting 8% or whatever.

[04:38] No matter what just for doing this deal.

[04:39] So that's the minimum of 200 k, because there's a minimum of two month carry.

[04:43] All right, that's the key point here.

[04:44] Beyond that, what happened is after this deal ended up closing, here's what happened.

[04:50] So the individuals who did the deal, they flew out to CS and have a kind of like a

[04:54] celebratory dinner.

[04:55] This was kind of interesting.

[04:56] So they're like, hey, you're lawyer sin over the note, and it looked a little light.

[05:00] And I was like, what do you mean?

[05:01] They were like, well, you know, we've had the, we've had the property for 100 plus days

[05:06] now, right?

[05:07] And the note said 275 k.

[05:12] And I was like, huh, and they were like, yeah, I mean, that wasn't what we agreed on.

[05:16] We agreed on paying you more than that.

[05:19] And so this is, so here's what happened, right?

[05:22] So our lawyers messed up for lack of a better term.

[05:25] They just messed up when they sent the loan invoices for repayment at the end of this.

[05:31] And what was interesting is that this individual, because he's long term minded as well,

[05:34] and also a high ultra high net worth individual.

[05:37] This is why I think this is probably more valuable than deal itself was like, yeah, my lawyer saw it.

[05:42] He was saying his lawyer saw it and said, yeah, let's just send the money like, and, you know,

[05:47] they made a mistake.

[05:48] Let's move on, right?

[05:49] And save ourselves, you know, almost 100 grand, which I'll show you in a second with the actual

[05:53] amount was.

[05:54] And he said, ah, man, he's like, now you can't be my lawyer anymore.

[05:57] And he was telling me this story over dinner.

[05:59] And it was so funny because we both had this kind of same, it's, so the more deals you do

[06:04] with someone, there's a big five-liter word that starts to occur, which is trust.

[06:08] The more times you lend someone money, the more times they pay it back as agreed upon,

[06:12] right?

[06:13] And especially if you have an instance where they have the opportunity to screw you over

[06:17] or most people would, especially if they think that you won't find out, which we might not

[06:23] have found out.

[06:24] But the thing is, I might have also looked at these notes a while later and been like, like,

[06:28] if I had free time and been like, this is off, what is this, right?

[06:31] And so anyways, he caught it.

[06:32] His lawyer caught it.

[06:33] His lawyer said to go forward with it anyways.

[06:35] He chose not to and to bring it to our attention.

[06:38] And so we obviously are not going to use our lawyer anymore.

[06:41] He's not going to use his lawyer anymore.

[06:43] His R guys made a stupid bonehead in mistake and that's what we pay them for.

[06:46] He's not making these mistakes and double check these things, right?

[06:49] And his made an ethical error, right?

[06:50] So mine was at error on skill.

[06:52] His was an error on ethics.

[06:53] And if you remember my, how I pigmented towards inventors video, I talk about the three circles,

[06:57] right?

[06:58] You have the, the ethical component, then you have the hard working component.

[07:02] So both of these guys worked hard, but they didn't have this, one of them didn't have

[07:05] the skill and the other one didn't have the ethics.

[07:07] So this is what ended up happening.

[07:08] All right.

[07:09] So 275 was the deal.

[07:11] Instead, we did, we had, it was 100 in something days or whatever.

[07:15] So we had 300 K plus 3333 per day until the deal was closed.

[07:24] All right.

[07:25] And so it ended up being like 350 K or something like that with decimals, right?

[07:30] That we got paid back plus the 2.5 million.

[07:33] All right.

[07:34] So we got to check back for 2.85 million.

[07:38] And we have trust, which is the most valuable thing that you can have.

[07:42] Right?

[07:43] And so this is, this is ultimately one of those currencies that people do not understand

[07:46] who are new to business is that trust is the most valuable thing.

[07:49] I mean, we were talking about this over dinner and he was like, you only get one name,

[07:52] you know what I mean?

[07:53] You only get one, you only get one name, you only get one reputation.

[07:56] See if I can knock at the center of my eyes here.

[07:58] And we only get one.

[07:59] And we're obviously hoping to do bigger and bigger deals with you guys is, you know,

[08:03] we earn more and more trust than we can do, you know, $10 million deals, $50 million deals.

[08:08] And we'd rather have partners that we know we can rely on.

[08:10] And so it goes both ways.

[08:11] And so, any who, this was a very valuable experience for me in two ways.

[08:16] One, obviously because the, the whole deal worked out.

[08:19] And for those of you who were like, why don't you, don't a mastermind?

[08:21] It's like, because I could just move the money and not do anything and make almost

[08:25] form to get it.

[08:26] That is why.

[08:27] I'm sorry with you guys, like that's why I don't sell anything on this channel.

[08:29] That's why the, the, the trainings we have on acquisition.com are free for all entrepreneurs

[08:32] and the book is 99 cents you can get it on Amazon because I just want everyone to win.

[08:35] So anyways, this is the deal.

[08:37] A lot of people like no one taught me how to do this stuff.

[08:39] So it was me just trying to figure this out as I go.

[08:41] So hopefully you can think through some of these variables if you ever get in that situation.

[08:45] And then also, I just decided to note here, I do have to pay 50% in taxes on this.

[08:50] And so that's why you need, for me, I have to have really high returns on any kind of

[08:54] private lending because the, I have to realize those gains, right?

[08:58] And they're not capital gains to regular income.

[09:00] And so when you have that, I'm actually making 175 after after taxes on this deal, which,

[09:06] you know, in terms of percentages on on on my original, I still want to loan that money out.

[09:11] Again, you know, again this year so that I can still get at least, you know, 10 or 20%

[09:15] return on it.

[09:16] That's the big deal in terms of the money stuff.

[09:18] The bigger deal was the trust and the value of having trusted partners because they are

[09:23] worth their weight in gold.

[09:25] And, you know, we should only be so lucky to have a handful of people that you can trust

[09:29] throughout your business career.

[09:30] And, you know, my hope is that from this channel that you are one of them in terms of, in

[09:36] terms of yourself.

[09:37] And then also maybe, you know, you go your business to three or five or 10 million here.

[09:40] And then you let us invest with you so that you can help you grow more.

[09:43] So anyways, keeping awesome, those ination love you.

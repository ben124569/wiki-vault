# Question Framework Guide for Workflow Design

## Purpose

This guide provides a structured approach to gathering requirements through thoughtful questioning. The goal is to understand the user's needs without overwhelming them, building clarity through natural conversation.

## Core Philosophy

- Start broad, get specific gradually
- Ask one main question at a time
- Use the user's answers to guide next questions
- Validate understanding before moving deeper
- Keep the user in control of direction and pace

## Level 1: Problem Discovery

Start here to understand the fundamental issue or opportunity.

### Essential Questions
- "What specific problem are you trying to solve with this workflow?"
- "What's currently not working or missing in your process?"
- "What triggered the idea for this workflow?"
- "Who is most affected by this problem?"
- "How is this currently being handled?"

### What to Listen For
- Pain points and frustrations
- Time-consuming manual tasks
- Information getting lost or delayed
- Quality or consistency issues
- Scaling challenges

### Follow-Up Prompts
- "Can you walk me through a typical example?"
- "How often does this happen?"
- "What's the impact when this goes wrong?"

## Level 2: Context & Environment

Understanding constraints and available resources shapes what's possible.

### Key Questions
- "What tools and systems are currently available?"
- "Who would be involved in executing this workflow?"
- "What are your time and budget constraints?"
- "Are there compliance or security requirements?"
- "How does this need to integrate with existing processes?"

### Areas to Explore
- Technical capabilities and limitations
- Team skills and availability
- Organizational culture and change readiness
- Existing infrastructure
- Regulatory requirements

### Clarifying Questions
- "Is everyone comfortable with [specific tool]?"
- "Do you have flexibility on timeline?"
- "Are there any non-negotiable requirements?"

## Level 3: Outcome Definition

Define what success looks like to ensure alignment.

### Success Questions
- "When this workflow is working perfectly, what does that look like?"
- "How will you measure if this is successful?"
- "What would represent a big win?"
- "Who benefits and how?"
- "What timeline feels realistic?"

### Metrics to Explore
- Time savings
- Error reduction
- User satisfaction
- Cost reduction
- Quality improvement
- Scalability gains

### Validation Questions
- "Is [specific metric] the most important measure?"
- "Would partial automation still be valuable?"
- "What's the minimum viable version?"

## Level 4: Scope & Boundaries

Determine what's included and what's not.

### Scoping Questions
- "Should this handle every scenario or focus on common cases?"
- "Is this a one-time process or ongoing?"
- "What's the expected volume?"
- "Are there different variations needed?"
- "Should we start simple and expand later?"

### Boundary Setting
- "What's definitely in scope?"
- "What's explicitly out of scope?"
- "What might be phase 2?"
- "How do we handle exceptions?"
- "Where does this workflow start and end?"

## Level 5: Component Breakdown

Identify the main building blocks of the workflow.

### Structure Questions
- "What are the main stages from start to finish?"
- "What decisions need to be made?"
- "What information is needed at each stage?"
- "Where might bottlenecks occur?"
- "Are there natural checkpoints?"

### Process Flow
- "What triggers the workflow?"
- "What are the handoff points?"
- "Can any steps happen in parallel?"
- "What requires sequential processing?"
- "Where are approvals needed?"

## Level 6: Implementation Details

Get specific about execution requirements.

### Detailed Questions
- "Who specifically performs each step?"
- "What exact information is needed as input?"
- "What tools are used for each task?"
- "How long should each step take?"
- "What happens when something goes wrong?"

### Practical Considerations
- "How do people know when to act?"
- "How is progress tracked?"
- "How are problems escalated?"
- "What training is needed?"
- "How do we handle absences?"

## Advanced Questioning Techniques

### Testing Assumptions
When you sense an unstated assumption:
- "Help me understand why [specific requirement] is necessary"
- "What would happen if we didn't include [element]?"
- "Is [assumption] always true or are there exceptions?"

### Exploring Alternatives
When multiple approaches are possible:
- "I see a few ways to handle this - would you like to explore options?"
- "What if we approached it from a different angle?"
- "Have you considered [alternative approach]?"

### Uncovering Hidden Requirements
To find what hasn't been mentioned:
- "What else should I know about this process?"
- "Are there any political or cultural factors to consider?"
- "What's the history behind this workflow?"

## Question Sequencing Strategies

### For Simple Workflows
1. Problem identification
2. Desired outcome
3. Basic steps
4. Success criteria

### For Complex Workflows
1. Problem and impact
2. Stakeholder analysis
3. Current state assessment
4. Future state vision
5. Gap analysis
6. Detailed requirements
7. Implementation planning

### For Unclear Requirements
1. Start with examples
2. Identify patterns
3. Abstract to principles
4. Define boundaries
5. Detail specifics

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Vague Language
- "Better" → "Better in what specific way?"
- "Faster" → "What's the current time and target?"
- "Easier" → "What makes it difficult now?"

### Scope Creep Indicators
- "While we're at it..."
- "It would be nice if..."
- "Can it also..."

### Unrealistic Expectations
- "Fully automated"
- "No errors ever"
- "Works for everything"

## Validation Throughout

### After Each Level
"Let me summarize what I understand so far... Is that accurate?"

### When Changing Topics
"Before we move on, are you comfortable with what we've covered?"

### Before Finalizing
"Looking at everything we've discussed, what's missing?"

## Tips for Effective Questioning

1. **Listen actively** - Use their answers to guide next questions
2. **Be curious, not interrogative** - Show genuine interest
3. **Allow silence** - Give time for thoughtful responses
4. **Clarify ambiguity** - Don't assume you understand
5. **Confirm understanding** - Restate in your own words
6. **Stay flexible** - Adapt your approach to their communication style

Remember: The goal is collaborative discovery, not a checklist to complete. Let the conversation flow naturally while ensuring you gather the information needed to create an effective workflow specification.

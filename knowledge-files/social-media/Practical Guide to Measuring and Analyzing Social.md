# Practical Guide to Measuring and Analyzing Social Media Content Performance for Small Businesses

**Key Takeaway:** Focus on a tailored set of actionable metrics—aligned to your goals—rather than chasing raw follower counts. Use platform insights and simple benchmarks to inform a content framework, track progress with clear templates, and continuously optimize via A/B tests and data-driven pivots.

***
## 1. Key Metrics by Business Goal

**Brand Awareness**

- **Reach:** Number of unique users who saw your content.
- **Impressions:** Total times content was displayed.
- **Follower Growth Rate:** % increase over period.

**Engagement**

- **Engagement Rate:** (Likes + Comments + Shares + Saves) ÷ Reach.
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR):** Clicks on links or CTAs ÷ Impressions.
- **Video Completion Rate:** % of viewers watching full video.

**Lead Generation**

- **Conversion Rate:** Actions (sign-ups, downloads) ÷ Clicks.
- **Cost per Lead (CPL):** Ad spend ÷ Leads captured.
- **Form Abandonment Rate:** Started vs completed sign-ups.

**Conversion**

- **Sales Revenue from Social:** Attributed purchases.
- **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS):** Revenue ÷ Ad spend.
- **Cart Abandonment Rate:** Initiated checkout vs completed.

**Customer Retention**

- **Repeat Purchase Rate:** % of customers buying again.
- **Churn Rate:** % of customers unsubscribing or disengaging.

## 2. Platform-Specific Metrics

### Facebook Insights

- **Page Reach \& Post Reach:** Unique users reached.
- **Post Engagements:** Total likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
- **Page Followers \& Growth:** Net change in followers.
- **Link Clicks \& CTA Clicks:** Actions on buttons or links.

### Instagram Insights

- **Accounts Reached \& Impressions:** Unique vs total views.
- **Engagements:** Likes, comments, saves, shares, profile visits.
- **Story Replies \& Exits:** Interactive vs drop-off metrics.
- **Hashtag Performance:** Impressions from hashtags.

**What Each Metric Means**

- **Reach vs Impressions:** Reach counts unique users; impressions count views (including repeats).
- **Engagement vs Vanity Metrics:** Engagement shows real interest; vanity metrics (e.g., raw follower count) can mask low interaction.

**Vanity Metrics vs Actionable Metrics**

- Vanity: Followers, total views.
- Actionable: Engagement rate, CTR, conversions—metrics you can benchmark and improve.

## 3. Benchmarks by Industry

| Industry | Avg. Engagement Rate | Avg. Monthly Follower Growth |

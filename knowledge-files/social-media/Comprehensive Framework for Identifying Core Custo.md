# Comprehensive Framework for Identifying Core Customer Beliefs Across Small Business Industries

Based on extensive research across multiple industries and customer psychology studies, I've developed a comprehensive framework that maps the core beliefs, objections, and buying behaviors for eight major small business categories. This framework is structured for immediate AI integration and practical application.

## Framework Overview

The framework analyzes each industry across six critical dimensions:

1. **Most Common Objections** - The top 5 obstacles prospects raise
2. **Core Beliefs Required** - Essential mindset shifts prospects must make before buying
3. **Industry Misconceptions** - Widespread false beliefs that create resistance
4. **Competitor Positioning Weaknesses** - Common gaps in how others address objections
5. **Emotional Triggers** - Primary psychological drivers that motivate purchases
6. **Trust-Building Factors** - Specific credibility indicators for each industry

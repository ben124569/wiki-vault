# Caption Formulas for Viral Mindset Coaching Content

*Extracted from @avayuergens and @personalbrandlaunch high-performing posts*

## Formula 1: The Reframe Hook
**Purpose**: Educational content that shifts perspective
**Character Count**: 150-200 characters
**Best for**: Limiting beliefs, mindset shifts

### Structure
```
[Controversial/surprising statement about common belief]

[Personal experience or client story - 1-2 sentences]

[Engagement question]

```

### Example
```
Most people think confidence comes from never feeling scared.

I used to believe this too. Then I realized I was waiting for fear to disappear before taking action.

Here's what I've learned:
→ Confident people feel fear and act anyway
→ Courage is built by doing scary things repeatedly  
→ Your nervous system can't tell excitement from fear

The truth? Confidence isn't the absence of fear—it's the decision to grow through it.

What's one thing you've been avoiding because it scares you?

Comment "COURAGE" if you're ready to feel the fear and do it anyway 👇

## Formula 2: The Story Hook
**Purpose**: Personal connection through vulnerability
**Character Count**: 180-250 characters
**Best for**: Transformation stories, relatability

### Structure
```
[Time frame] ago, I [specific struggle/limiting situation].

[Brief description of the problem and how it affected you - 2-3 sentences]

Then [turning point moment/realization].

Now I [current state/what you do differently]:
• [Specific change 1]
• [Specific change 2]
• [Specific change 3]

[Key lesson learned from the journey]

If you're [specific situation similar to your past], [encouraging message].

Comment "[KEYWORD]" and I'll share [specific resource/tip] 💪

#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3
```

### Example
```
2 years ago, I was sabotaging every opportunity that came my way.

I'd get close to a breakthrough, then find excuses to quit. I convinced myself I wasn't ready, smart enough, or deserving of success.

Then I realized: I was protecting myself from potential failure by failing on purpose.

Now I help high-performers recognize their sabotage patterns:
• Procrastination before deadlines
• Perfectionism that prevents action
• Negative self-talk during growth moments

The breakthrough? Your sabotage pattern is actually your brain trying to keep you safe.

If you're tired of getting in your own way, you're not broken—you just need better strategies.

Comment "SABOTAGE" and I'll share my self-sabotage assessment 💪

## Formula 4: The Myth Buster
**Purpose**: Challenge common beliefs in your niche
**Character Count**: 160-220 characters
**Best for**: Contrarian content, education

### Structure
```
Myth: [Common belief in your niche]

Reality: [Your contrarian perspective]

[2-3 sentences explaining why the common belief is limiting]

Here's what actually works:
→ [Alternative approach 1]
→ [Alternative approach 2]
→ [Alternative approach 3]

[Reinforcing statement about your approach]

[Question to engage audience in the debate]

Comment "[KEYWORD]" if you want [specific resource] 🔥

#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3
```

### Example
```
Myth: You need motivation to take action

Reality: Motivation is unreliable and fleeting

Waiting for motivation is why most people stay stuck. High performers know that action creates motivation, not the other way around.

Here's what actually works:
→ Build systems that don't require feeling motivated
→ Start with micro-actions (2-minute rule)
→ Use implementation intentions ("If this, then that")

The secret? Discipline is a skill, not a personality trait.

Do you wait for motivation or create it through action?

Comment "ACTION" if you want my motivation-free productivity system 🔥

#motivation #discipline #productivity
```

## Formula 5: The Question Hook
**Purpose**: High engagement through curiosity
**Character Count**: 100-160 characters
**Best for**: Discussion starters, polls

### Structure
```
[Thought-provoking question related to your niche]

[1-2 sentences providing context for why this question matters]

My take: [Your opinion/answer to the question]

[2-3 bullet points supporting your position]

But I'm curious about your perspective.

[Restate the question or ask follow-up]

Drop your thoughts below 👇

#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3
```

### Example
```
Is it better to be a perfectionist or someone who takes imperfect action?

This question came up in a coaching session yesterday, and it got me thinking about the hidden costs of perfectionism.

My take: Imperfect action beats perfect inaction every time.

• Perfectionism is often fear disguised as high standards
• Done is better than perfect when you're learning
• You can't optimize something that doesn't exist yet

But I'm curious about your perspective.

Have you found perfectionism helping or hurting your progress?

## Formula 6: The Transformation Showcase
**Purpose**: Social proof through client/personal results
**Character Count**: 200-280 characters
**Best for**: Success stories, credibility

### Structure
```
[Timeframe]: [Starting situation/problem]
[Timeframe]: [Current situation/results]

[Brief story of the transformation - 3-4 sentences]

The key breakthrough was [specific mindset shift or strategy].

This is what happened when [person] stopped [limiting behavior] and started [empowering behavior]:

• [Specific result 3]

[Encouraging message for people in similar situations]

Comment "[KEYWORD]" if you're ready for [similar transformation] ✨

#transformation #results #mindsetshift
```

### Example
```
January 2023: Sarah was paralyzed by imposter syndrome
August 2024: She's running a 6-figure coaching business

Sarah came to me convinced she was "fake" and didn't deserve success. She'd downplay her wins and overanalyze every decision.

The key breakthrough was realizing imposter syndrome is just evidence you're growing.

This is what happened when Sarah stopped hiding and started owning her expertise:
• Launched her program with confidence
• Raised her prices without apologizing
• Started speaking on podcasts and stages

Your expertise is needed. The world is waiting for what you have to offer.

Comment "IMPOSTER" if you're ready to own your worth ✨

[1-2 sentences explaining why this is controversial]

Here's why I believe this:
[3-4 bullet points with reasoning]

I know this might ruffle some feathers, but [reinforcing why your position matters].

[Question to get people to share their stance]

Agree or disagree? Let me know below 👇

#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3
```

### Example
```
Unpopular opinion: "Follow your passion" is terrible advice

This mindset has left countless people frustrated and broke, waiting for lightning-bolt clarity that never comes.

Here's why I believe this:
• Passion often follows mastery, not the other way around
• Skills pay bills, not just feelings  
• You can develop passion for things you're good at
• Passion without strategy is just an expensive hobby

I know this might ruffle some feathers, but I'd rather give you practical truth than feel-good fiction.

What do you think—passion first or skill first?

[2-3 sentences expanding on the reminder with specific context]

[Actionable suggestion for implementing the reminder]

[Question or call-to-action related to the reminder]

Save this for [specific time/situation when they'd need this reminder] 💫

#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3
```

### Example
```
Daily reminder: You don't need permission to outgrow old versions of yourself

The person you were last year doesn't get to make decisions for who you're becoming. Growth requires letting go of familiar limitations.

Today, ask yourself: "What would I do if I trusted my next-level self?"

Then do that thing, even if your current self feels scared.

Save this for days when you're tempted to play small 💫

## Formula 9: The Behind-the-Scenes
**Purpose**: Authenticity and relatability
**Character Count**: 180-250 characters
**Best for**: Humanizing your brand, building connection

### Structure
```
Behind the scenes: [What people see vs. reality]

[Honest description of your actual experience - 2-3 sentences]

The truth is:
• [Honest insight 1]
• [Honest insight 2]
• [Honest insight 3]

[Key message about why you're sharing this]

Anyone else relate to this? 🙋‍♀️

#authenticity #reallife #entrepreneur
```

### Example
```
Behind the scenes: People think I have it all figured out

The truth is: I still have moments of doubt, failed launches, and days when I question everything about my business.

The truth is:
• Success doesn't eliminate self-doubt
• Having a platform doesn't mean having all the answers
• Growth happens in the discomfort, not despite it

I share this because perfectionism is the enemy of connection. My mess is part of my message.

Anyone else tired of pretending they have it all together? 🙋‍♀️

#authenticity #reallife #entrepreneur

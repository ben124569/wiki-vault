### Mindset Coaching Example
```
I used to think confidence meant never feeling scared.

I'd avoid opportunities because I felt nervous.

Then I learned: Confidence isn't the absence of fear.

It's feeling the fear and choosing to act anyway.

Now I teach clients: Your nervous system can't tell the difference between excitement and fear.

The lesson? Reframe your nerves as excitement for growth.

High performers don't rely on motivation. They rely on structure.

Unpopular opinion: Positive thinking is overrated.

Most people think you just need to "think positive" to change your life.

But here's why they're wrong:

Real growth comes from realistic optimism + consistent action.

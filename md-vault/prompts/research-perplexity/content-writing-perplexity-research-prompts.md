## Implementation Guide

### After Running These Prompts:

1. **Save each response** as the suggested .md file

2. **Extract the examples** - The value is in seeing 100+ complete post examples, not theory

3. **Format for reference** - Make it easy to search/scan:
   ```markdown
   ## Hook Pattern: Problem-Agitation
   
   Example 1 - Chiropractor:
   "Tired of waking up with back pain every morning?"
   
   Example 2 - Business Coach:
   "Still struggling to hit your revenue goals despite working 60-hour weeks?"
   ```

4. **Test the GPT** - Can it reference these patterns when creating content?

5. **Add industry examples** - If your friend's clients are in specific niches, run follow-up prompts for those industries specifically

### Follow-Up Prompts (Industry-Specific):

After getting general templates, refine with:

```
"Using the hook patterns from our previous conversation, generate 50 additional hooks specifically for [chiropractors/restaurants/real estate agents/coaches]. Make them hyper-specific to that industry's common pain points, language patterns, and customer situations."
```

These 8 files will give the GPT:
- 300+ complete post examples to pattern-match
- Proven formulas with placeholders
- Industry-specific language
- Psychology-backed approaches
- Ethical engagement tactics

**This is 10x more useful than theory guides.**

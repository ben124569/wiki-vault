# Research Methodology Guide

## Core Research Pattern

This methodology is extracted from real-world research scenarios and represents the optimal flow for complex investigative projects.

## The Multi-Platform Research Stack

### Platform Strengths & Use Cases

**ChatGPT - Visual & Technical Analysis**
- **Best For**: Image analysis, visual assessment, technical evaluation
- **Strengths**: Can analyze photos, identify problems, assess conditions
- **Use When**: You have visual materials, need technical assessment, want pattern recognition
- **Prompt Style**: Direct, with clear context about what to examine

**Perplexity - Web Research & Data Gathering**
- **Best For**: Current information, pricing, market data, comparative analysis
- **Strengths**: Real-time web search, source aggregation, fact-finding
- **Use When**: Need current prices, industry standards, comparative data, expert opinions
- **Prompt Style**: Specific queries with location/industry context

**Claude - Strategic Analysis & Synthesis**
- **Best For**: Complex reasoning, multi-factor analysis, strategic planning
- **Strengths**: Connecting disparate information, strategic thinking, nuanced analysis
- **Use When**: Need to synthesize findings, make strategic decisions, understand implications
- **Prompt Style**: Comprehensive context with all relevant data

## Research Workflow Architecture

### Stage 1: Problem Definition & Scoping

**Questions to Answer:**
- What decision needs to be made?
- What could go wrong if we don't have good information?
- What's our budget/timeline for this decision?
- Who are the stakeholders?
- What are the deal-breakers?

**Deliverable**: Research scope document with clear objectives

### Stage 2: Information Mapping

**Identify Information Categories:**
- **Known Unknowns**: What we know we need to find out
- **Potential Unknowns**: What we might discover we need to know
- **Risk Factors**: What could invalidate our assumptions
- **Decision Factors**: What will actually drive the decision

**Deliverable**: Information requirements matrix

### Stage 3: Phased Research Design

**Phase Structure Template:**

```markdown
Phase X: [Name]
Objective: [What we're trying to learn]
Platform: [Best tool for this task]
Parallel With: [Other phases that can run simultaneously]
Depends On: [What must complete first]
Success Criteria: [How we know we have enough]
Risk Flags: [What would concern us]
```

**Typical Phase Progression:**
1. **Discovery Phase**: Cast wide net, identify issues
2. **Assessment Phase**: Evaluate what was found
3. **Deep Dive Phase**: Investigate specific concerns
4. **Comparison Phase**: Benchmark against alternatives
5. **Synthesis Phase**: Bring it all together
6. **Validation Phase**: Check conclusions

### Stage 4: Prompt Engineering

**Effective Prompt Components:**

1. **Context Setting** (1-2 sentences)
   - Current situation
   - Why this matters

2. **Specific Request**
   - Exact task to perform
   - Clear boundaries

3. **Output Requirements**
   - Format needed
   - Level of detail
   - What to prioritize

4. **Handoff Instructions**
   - "I'll take this to [next step]"
   - "This will be combined with [other research]"

### Stage 5: Progressive Synthesis

**After Each Research Wave:**
1. Document findings in master plan
2. Identify new questions raised
3. Assess if strategy pivot needed
4. Generate next wave prompts
5. Update risk assessment

**Synthesis Framework:**
```markdown
## Findings Integration

### What We've Learned
- [Key finding 1 with source]
- [Key finding 2 with source]

### What This Means
- [Implication 1]
- [Implication 2]

### What We Still Need
- [Gap 1]
- [Gap 2]

### Emerging Risks
- [New risk identified]
- [Assumption challenged]
```

## Research Quality Gates

### Minimum Requirements to Proceed:
- **Phase 1 → 2**: Problem clearly defined
- **Phase 2 → 3**: Key issues identified
- **Phase 3 → 4**: Major risks assessed
- **Phase 4 → 5**: Comparisons complete
- **Phase 5 → Decision**: Confidence threshold met

### Pivot Triggers:
- Costs exceed budget by >20%
- Timeline doesn't support decision
- Critical risk discovered
- Better alternative found
- Assumptions proven false

## Risk-Aware Research

### Always Investigate:
1. **The Visible Problem**: What you can see
2. **The Underlying Cause**: Why it exists
3. **The Hidden Implications**: What it might indicate
4. **The Future Trajectory**: Where it's heading
5. **The Mitigation Options**: How to address it

### Risk Categorization:
- **Deal Breakers**: Stop immediately if found
- **Major Concerns**: Need mitigation strategy
- **Minor Issues**: Factor into cost/timeline
- **Non-Issues**: Document but don't worry

## Final Deliverable Structure

### Executive Decision Brief:
```markdown
# Decision Brief: [Topic]

## Bottom Line
[One paragraph - should we do this or not?]

## Key Findings
1. [Most important finding]
2. [Second most important]
3. [Third most important]

## Financial Analysis
- Initial Cost: [Amount]
- Additional Costs: [Repairs/fees/etc]
- Total Investment: [All-in number]
- Market Comparison: [How this compares]

## Risk Assessment
**High Risks**: [With mitigation strategies]
**Medium Risks**: [With monitoring plans]
**Low Risks**: [Noted but manageable]

## Recommendation
[Clear action with rationale]

## Supporting Data
[All sources, dates, and references]
```

## Research Acceleration Techniques

### Parallel Processing:
- Run independent research tracks simultaneously
- Use different platforms for different aspects
- Batch similar questions together
- Coordinate timing for synthesis points

### Progressive Refinement:
- Start broad, get specific
- Use findings to guide next questions
- Don't over-research early phases
- Know when "good enough" is enough

### Decision Shortcuts:
- Identify "killer criteria" early
- Set maximum research investment
- Use rules of thumb for quick elimination
- Focus depth on finalists only

## Overview
Perplexity AI is an AI-powered answer engine that searches the web in real-time and provides direct, cited answers. It excels at providing current, factual information with proper source attribution, making it superior to static knowledge for time-sensitive or rapidly-changing information.

## Core Features and When to Use Them
### 1. Perplexity Search (Main Feature)
**What it does:** Real-time web search with synthesized, cited answers
**Best for:**
- Current events and breaking news
- Recent market data, stock prices, economic indicators
- Latest research findings and scientific developments
- Product reviews, pricing, and availability
- Real-time sports scores, election results, weather
- Fact-checking and source verification
- Any information that changes frequently

**Key capabilities:**
- Provides citations for all claims
- Searches multiple sources simultaneously
- Offers conversational follow-up capabilities
- Updates information in real-time

### 2. Focus Modes
**Academic Focus:**
- Use for: Scholarly research, peer-reviewed studies, academic papers
- Searches: Journal databases, research repositories, academic institutions
- Best when: Need credible, peer-reviewed sources

**Social Focus:**
- Use for: Public opinion, trends, community discussions
- Searches: Reddit, Twitter, forums, social platforms
- Best when: Understanding public sentiment or viral topics

**Video Focus:**
- Use for: Tutorials, demonstrations, visual learning
- Searches: YouTube, video platforms with timestamps
- Best when: User needs step-by-step guidance or visual explanations

**Writing Focus:**
- Use for: Creative content, technical writing assistance
- Optimized for: Content generation and writing enhancement
- Best when: Need writing support or content ideas

**Math Focus (Wolfram Alpha powered):**
- Use for: Complex calculations, data analysis, mathematical problems
- Capabilities: Advanced computations, statistical analysis, graphing
- Best when: Need precise mathematical solutions or data computation

**Web Focus:**
- Use for: General internet search (default mode)
- Searches: Entire web including news, blogs, websites
- Best when: Broad information gathering needed

### 3. Perplexity Labs
**What it does:** Complex, multi-step AI workflows that create comprehensive deliverables
**Processing time:** 10+ minutes of autonomous work
**Best for:**
- Interactive dashboards and web applications
- Comprehensive market research reports
- Data analysis with visualizations
- Business strategy documents
- Financial analysis and trading strategies
- Technical documentation and code projects
- Marketing campaign strategies

**Key capabilities:**
- Autonomous multi-tool usage
- Deep web research and data gathering
- Code execution and chart creation
- Downloadable assets (reports, spreadsheets, presentations)
- Interactive web applications (when applicable)

**When to recommend Labs over regular search:**
- Task requires multiple data sources and synthesis
- User needs a complete deliverable (not just information)
- Project involves data analysis or visualization
- Task is complex enough to warrant 10+ minutes of work

### 4. Spaces
**What it does:** Custom AI assistants with specific instructions and focus areas
**Best for:**
- Specialized domain expertise (legal, medical, technical)
- Consistent communication style across multiple queries
- Organized project work with specific parameters
- Customized response formatting
- Domain-specific knowledge boundaries

**Use cases:**
- Creating industry-specific research assistants
- Maintaining consistent tone for business communications
- Organizing searches by project or topic
- Setting specialized knowledge parameters

## Strategic Use Guidelines
### When to Recommend Perplexity Over Other Tools
- **Real-time information needs:** Stock prices, news, current events
- **Citation requirements:** When sources and credibility matter
- **Multi-source synthesis:** Need information from various sources combined
- **Fact-checking:** Verifying claims against current information
- **Market intelligence:** Current trends, pricing, competitive analysis

### When NOT to Recommend Perplexity
- **Static knowledge tasks:** Historical facts, established concepts
- **Creative writing:** Original fiction, poetry, creative expression
- **Personal data analysis:** Information from user's own files/documents
- **Offline calculations:** Simple math that doesn't require web data
- **Subjective preferences:** Personal opinions, creative choices

### Integration Strategy for Different Query Types
**Research Queries:**
- Start with appropriate Focus Mode
- Use conversational follow-ups to drill deeper
- Leverage citation capabilities for credibility

**Complex Projects:**
- Assess if task requires 10+ minutes of autonomous work
- If yes: Recommend Labs
- If no: Use regular search with follow-ups

**Ongoing Work:**
- Suggest creating a Space for consistent parameters
- Set up domain-specific instructions
- Maintain organized search history

**Data-Heavy Tasks:**
- Use Math Focus for calculations
- Consider Labs for comprehensive analysis
- Leverage chart creation capabilities

## Best Practices for Tool Selection
1. **Assess information freshness needs:** Recent = Perplexity, Historical = existing knowledge
2. **Consider source requirements:** Citations needed = Perplexity
3. **Evaluate task complexity:** Multi-step complex work = Labs, Simple queries = Search
4. **Determine specialization needs:** Domain-specific = Spaces with custom instructions
5. **Check data visualization needs:** Charts/graphs required = Labs or Math Focus

## Key Advantages to Leverage
- **Real-time accuracy:** Information is current as of search time
- **Source transparency:** All claims include citations
- **Comprehensive synthesis:** Combines multiple sources intelligently
- **Conversational depth:** Natural follow-up capabilities
- **Specialized search:** Focus modes target specific content types
- **Complex project handling:** Labs manages multi-step workflows autonomously

This knowledge base should inform when and how to recommend Perplexity AI as a tool for users, emphasizing its strengths in real-time, cited information gathering and complex project execution.

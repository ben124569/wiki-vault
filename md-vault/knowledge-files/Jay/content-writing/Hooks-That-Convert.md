## Hook Usage Guidelines
### Matching Hooks to Content Types
**Educational Content**: Use Curiosity Gap or Problem Agitation hooks
**Personal Stories**: Use Emotional Trigger or Social Proof hooks
**Transformation Content**: Use Solution Promise or Social Proof hooks
**Controversial Takes**: Use Problem Agitation or Curiosity Gap hooks
**Client Features**: Use Social Proof hooks exclusively

### Hook Performance Optimization
#### A/B Testing Strategy
- Test same content with 2 different hooks
- Track saves and engagement for each version
- Note which emotional category performs best for your audience
- Keep record of highest-performing hooks for your niche

#### Audience Matching
- **Beginners**: Use Solution Promise and Permission hooks
- **Intermediate**: Use Problem Agitation and Curiosity Gap hooks
- **Advanced**: Use Emotional Trigger and Social Proof hooks

### Hook Customization Formula
1. **Choose hook pattern** from categories above
2. **Insert your topic** (confidence, self-sabotage, etc.)
3. **Add specific detail** (timeframe, number, outcome)
4. **Test emotional tone** (gentle vs. direct)
5. **Refine based on results**

### Red Flags to Avoid
❌ Generic hooks without specific details
❌ Promises you can't deliver on
❌ Emotional manipulation vs. genuine insight
❌ Overusing same hook pattern
❌ Hooks that don't match your content depth

### Power Combinations

**Problem + Solution**: "You're stuck because of X, here's how to fix it…"
**Emotional + Permission**: "It's okay to feel scared, here's why…"
**Pattern + Proof**: "Every confident person does this, here's what it is…"

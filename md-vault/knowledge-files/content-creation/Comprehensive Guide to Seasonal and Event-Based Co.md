## 1. Holiday Content Strategy

**Major vs. Minor Holidays:** Focus on universally observed events (Christmas, New Year's) while selecting minor holidays aligned with your brand voice (e.g., National Pet Day for pet services).
**Authenticity Tips:** Share behind-the-scenes preparations, team traditions, and customer testimonials.
**Non-Holiday Content:** During holiday peaks, publish evergreen "how-to" guides, year-end roundups, and community spotlights to balance promotional noise.

## 2. Industry Seasonal Cycles

- **Health/Wellness:** Peak interest in January (resolutions), lull mid-year; leverage spring detox (March) and back-to-school mental health (August).
- **Home Services:** Busy in spring/fall for maintenance; slow mid-winter and peak summer for landscaping.
- **Retail:** Highest in November/December; clearance sales in January and July.
- **Food:** BBQ season in May–August; comfort food in September–November; festive menus in December.

## 3. Planning Timeline

- **Advance Planning:** Major campaigns—4–6 months ahead; smaller seasons—2–3 months ahead.
- **Promotion Start:** Sneak peeks 3–4 weeks before; full rollout 2 weeks prior.
- **Post-Season Follow-Up:** Share results, customer stories, "what's next" content within 1–2 weeks post-event.

## 4. Evergreen vs. Seasonal Balance

- **Ratio Recommendation:** 80% evergreen, 20% seasonal.
- **Repurposing Seasonal Content:** Transform holiday blog posts into "best of" guides or infographics for next year.
- **Timeless Topics:** "How to choose the right product/service," "Customer success stories," and foundational tutorials.

## 5. Content Templates for Each Season

- **Spring (Mar–May):** "Spring Renewal Checklist," "Top 5 Fresh Trends"
- **Summer (Jun–Aug):** "Summer Survival Guide," "Beat the Heat With…"
- **Fall (Sep–Nov):** "Preparation Tips for [Industry]," "Our Autumn Favorites"
- **Winter (Dec–Feb):** "Year in Review," "Goal-Setting Workshop"

## 6. Special Seasonal Opportunities

**Actionable Next Steps:**

1. **Audit existing content**, tagging evergreen vs. seasonal.
2. **Map content calendar** with above dates, blocking creative and review phases.
3. **Develop 3–5 core seasonal campaigns** per quarter, aligned to emotional themes.
4. **Set metrics** (engagement, leads, sales) and schedule performance reviews post-season.

This structured, month-by-month approach ensures consistent, relevant, and emotionally resonant content that maximizes audience engagement and drives business growth year-round.

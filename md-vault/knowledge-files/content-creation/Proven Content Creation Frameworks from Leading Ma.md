# Proven Content Creation Frameworks from Leading Marketing Experts

The following compendium presents **core frameworks**, **social media applications**, **real-world examples**, **resource links**, **notable quotes**, and **adaptation guidance** for small businesses.

***
## Alex Hormozi

**Main Takeaway:** Focus on **infinite value** by maximizing dream outcome and likelihood while minimizing time delay and effort/sacrifice.

### Core Frameworks

1. **\$100M Offers Framework**
	- **Grand Slam Offer**: Combine a unique value proposition, premium pricing, irresistible guarantee, and scalable payment terms to remove the cash constraint on growth.[^1]
2. **Value Equation**

$$
\text{Value} = \frac{\text{Dream Outcome} \times \text{Perceived Likelihood of Achievement}}{\text{Time Delay} + \text{Effort \& Sacrifice}}
$$

Reducing denominator toward zero yields infinite value.[^2]
3. **Educational Content Structure**
	- Hook with strong metric/confession
	- Contextual narrative ("before → after" progression)
	- Tactical takeaway/mental model
	- Soft CTA
4. **"Give Away the What, Sell the How"**
	- Freely reveal *what* to do; monetize *how* to implement via premium courses/coaching.

### Social Media Application

- **Raw-text posts** with clear hooks and bold metrics
- **Carousels** to break down frameworks in bite-sized slides
- **Daily posting** (5×/week) focusing on lessons learned from failures and wins[^3]

### Real-World Examples (LinkedIn \& Twitter)

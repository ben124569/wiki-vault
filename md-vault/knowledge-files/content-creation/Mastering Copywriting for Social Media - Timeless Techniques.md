# Mastering Copywriting for Social Media: Timeless Techniques from Legends to Modern Practitioners

**Unlock high-impact social media hooks by blending classic copywriting wisdom with today's fast-paced formats.**

***
## 1. David Ogilvy: "Never Sell, Tell"

**Core Principle:** Prioritize information over persuasion—educate your audience, then let them decide.
**Social Media Adaptation (60-90s Hook):**

- Lead with a surprising fact or statistic.
- Use a clear, benefit-oriented headline: "At 60 mph, the only sound in a new Rolls-Royce is the electric clock."
- Follow with a concise narrative that illustrates value.

**Example:**
Hook: "Want a marketing secret from the father of modern advertising? Here's why clarity beats cleverness every time…"

**Modern Application:** Authentic brand videos on LinkedIn that share product insights without overt sales pitches.

**Resource Links:**

- "Ogilvy on Advertising" (book)
- Online adaptation: Copyhackers article with 18 lessons[^1]

***
## 2. Eugene Schwartz: 5 Stages of Awareness

**Core Principle:** Tailor copy to where prospects sit on the "awareness spectrum."

1. Unaware
2. Problem Aware
3. Solution Aware
4. Product Aware
5. Most Aware

**Social Media Adaptation:**

- Unaware: Use curiosity-sparking visuals and questions.
- Problem Aware: Share a pain-point story in 2–3 sentences.
- Solution/Product/Most Aware: Rapid-fire features→benefits checklist.

**Example:**
"Ever feel like your emails end up in spam? Here's a 3-step fix that boosted open rates by 40%."

**Modern Examples:**

- Instagram carousels guiding followers from problem identification to solution.
- TikTok explainers keyed to viewer awareness level.

**Resources:**

- ActiveCampaign's overview of awareness stages[^2]
- Flow Marketing's breakdown of content strategies[^3]

***
## 3. Gary Halbert: The Boron Letters \& Emotional Triggers

**Core Principle:** Use A.I.D.A. (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) and tap deep emotions.

- "Starving crowd" concept: Sell to an audience actively seeking solutions.
- Mindset \& storytelling drive engagement.

**Social Media Adaptation:**

- Hook: Vivid, sensory-rich first line ("I was arrested for tax fraud—here's why it unlocked my best ad idea.")
- Body: Short anecdote illustrating a core lesson.
- CTA: "Reply with ✋ if you want my free swipe file."

**Example:**
A LinkedIn post recounting a personal setback, then fast pivot to a marketing insight.

**Resources \& Swipe Files:**

- Free Boron Letters archive[^4]
- Lessons overview: 10 key takeaways[^5]

## 4. Dan Kennedy: Magnetic Marketing \& Authority Positioning

**Core Principle:** Attract ideal clients by positioning yourself as an authority with clear "Who/What/Why/How."
**Framework:**

- Who: Define your niche.
- What: Clarify the transformation.
- Why: Highlight unique mechanism.
- How: Explain process steps.

**Social Media Adaptation:**

- 60-second video: "Who I help → What they achieve."
- Carousel: Each slide covers one element of the formula.

**Example:**
Instagram Reel: "Who: Coaches stuck at 5-figure months. What: Scale to 6-figures. Why: The 'Triple-Axis' method. How: Weekly 3-step sprints."

**Resources:**

- "Magnetic Marketing" (book)
- Dan Kennedy's newsletter and archives

***
## 5. Joanna Wiebe (Copyhackers): Conversion Copywriting Frameworks

**Core Principle:** Data-driven messaging hierarchy rooted in *Voice of Customer* research.
**Key Frameworks:**

- PIE (Promises, Illustration, Explanation)
- The 10-Point Messaging Hierarchy

**Social Media Adaptation:**

- Post series: Each slide reveals one messaging layer with real customer quotes.
- 90s tutorial: Outline the PIE model on a whiteboard.

**Example:**
Twitter thread dissecting a high-converting landing page, mapping each element to the hierarchy.

**Free Resources:**

- Copyhackers Tutorial Tuesdays[^6]
- 14+ free worksheets \& templates[^7]
- YouTube: "Foundations of Conversion Copywriting"[^8]

***
## 6. Eddie Shleyner (VeryGoodCopy): Micro-Copy \& Pattern Library

**Core Principle:** Leverage "clean, not clever" copy that hides behind reader focus.

- 343 micro-essays teach discrete persuasion techniques.

**Social Media Adaptation:**

- Micro-lessons series: 1-minute reels explaining one principle each.
- Pattern library posts: "Swipe these 5 subject-line templates."

**Example:**
Instagram Stories: "Cut every unnecessary adverb—here's how!"

**Resources:**

- VeryGoodCopy micro-articles[^9]
- Podcast interview \& book "Very Good Copy"[^10]

***
## 7. Alex Hormozi \& Russell Brunson: Offer-Driven Copy

**Core Principle:** Build "irresistible offers" that frame your pitch around pain and transformational value.

- Hormozi's "Pain is the Pitch": Sell at peak deprivation.
- Brunson's "Hook, Story, Offer" for funnels.

**Social Media Adaptation:**

- TikTok: Hook with extreme contrast ("Make \$0→\$10K in 30 days or I work for free.")
- Webinar ad: 30s montage of client pain→brink→breakthrough.

**Example:**
LinkedIn carousel: Hook ("Why most lead magnets fail"), Story (case study), Offer (simple next step).

**Resources:**

- "\$100M Offers" by Hormozi
- Brunson's "DotCom Secrets" \& ClickFunnels blueprints

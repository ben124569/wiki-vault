# Comprehensive Copy Frameworks for Handling Customer Objections in Social Media

**Key Takeaway:** Embedding objection handling directly into social posts—whether overtly or "stealthily"—builds trust, overcomes barriers, and accelerates conversions by reframing concerns as opportunities.

***
## 1. Price Objections

**Customer Language:** "It's too expensive," "I can't afford it," "I can find cheaper."

### Frameworks \& Tactics

1. **Cost vs. Value Reframe**
2. **Payment Breakdown Approach**
3. **Alternative Comparison**
4. **Long-Term Savings Angle**
5. **Hidden Costs of Not Buying**

### When to Address

- Mid-funnel consideration stage.

***
### 1.1 Cost vs. Value Reframe

#### 5 Complete Post Examples

**1. Head-On Approach**
Hook: "Think \$299 is steep? Let's talk ROI."
Body: "Most courses sit unused. Ours guarantees 3× your investment in 30 days—just ask Sarah, who landed a \$1,200 client after Week 2."
Social Proof: "✓ 97% student success rate"
Bridge: "Imagine tripling your coaching fees."
CTA: "Ready to invest in results? Enroll now."

**2. Story/Case Study**
Hook: "When Jane saw the price, she hesitated."
Body: "But she'd spent \$500 on programs that stalled. At \$299, our step-by-step method landed her first \$2K sale."
Social Proof: "Jane's earnings went from \$0 to \$2K in 4 weeks."
Bridge: "Her only regret? Not starting sooner."
CTA: "Join Jane today."

**3. Opportunity Cost Flip**
Hook: "What's \$299 compared to \$3,000 in lost revenue?"
Body: "Every month without our system costs you \$250+ in missed clients. This small investment pays for itself in days."
Social Proof: "Members report \$750 average monthly gains."
Bridge: "Don't let indecision cost you more."
CTA: "Secure your spot."

**4. ROI Breakdown**
Hook: "Here's how \$299 becomes \$2,994."
Body: "Weekly module: \$75. Client onboarding templates value: \$150. 1 premium client net: \$2,500."
Social Proof: "Our alumni average \$3,000 first-month revenue."
Bridge: "Total: \$2,994 return on \$299."
CTA: "Calculate your ROI now."

**5. Social Proof Focus**
Hook: "Over 1,200 students chose quality over cheap shortcuts."
Body: "They've earned \$1.2M+ collectively—despite a higher price tag."
Social Proof: "⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 'Worth every penny!'"
Bridge: "Join the proven crowd."
CTA: "Get instant access."

***
### 1.2 Format Variations

- **Myth/Fact:** "Myth: Expensive equals overpriced. Fact: High price often equals high ROI."
- **FAQ:** "Q: Why \$299? A: Because coaching alone costs \$1,000+ for half the results."
- **Story:** "How a \$299 bet changed Mark's life."
- **Carousel:** Slide 1: Objection; 2–4: Reframes; 5: CTA.
- **Infographic:** Cost vs. value chart.

4. **Guarantee/Risk Reversal**
5. **Behind-the-Scenes Transparency**

2. **Process Differentiation**
3. **Results Comparison**
4. **Value Stack**
5. **Who It's NOT For (Disqualification)**

### When to Address

- Mid-funnel differentiation.

***
## Stealth Objection Handling

- **Indirect Reframes:** Embed value insights in tutorials to pre-empt "too expensive" or "too long."
- **Value-First Posts:** Share quick tips with a soft CTA. Belief builds before price appears.
- **Examples (20+):**
	- "3 hacks to boost sales today…" → teaser of paid program
	- "Before/After client snapshot" → implies result without price mention
	- "Did you know 80% struggle with X?" → highlights problem before pitch

***
## Multi-Objection Posts

**Structure:**

1. Hook acknowledging 2–3 concerns
2. Quick reframes per objection
3. Combined proof element
4. Unified bridge to solution
5. CTA

**Examples (10+):**

- Addressing time \& price: "Only 10 minutes/day + \$299 = 3× ROI."
- Price \& skepticism: "\$299 for a system backed by 500+ case studies."

***
## Psychological Underpinnings

- **Framing Effect:** Reframing cost as investment shifts decision weights.
- **Social Proof:** Observing peers reduces uncertainty.
- **Loss Aversion:** Highlighting what's lost by not acting drives urgency.
- **Consistency Bias:** Commitment to quick wins fosters deeper buy-in.
- **Scarcity \& Urgency:** Limited spots amplify desire without overt pressure.

***

By systematically mapping objections to tailored frameworks, weaving in proven psychological triggers, and deploying varied content formats, each social post becomes a conversion catalyst rather than a mere pitch.
